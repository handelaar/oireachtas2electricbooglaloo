	<P>The Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s predecessor used to extend a loquacious c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte to all visitors from abroad in his own unique style.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of the Government, now in its ninth year, has been consistently to break its promises. I want to ask the Taoiseach about road safety and the carnage on our roads. Does he recall the promise he made in 1998 to roll out speed cameras nationally within two years? Does he accept that seven years later only three cameras in 20 locations in the greater Dublin area are in operation at any one time? Does he recall the Government&rsquo;s commitment to have 69 penalty points offences in operation by the end of 2003? Does he realise that two years later, only three penalty points offences have been enacted? Does he accept that on average only one garda in major stations is trained in the use of breathalyser equipment?</P>
    <P>The result of that failure is that road deaths continue to occur at a terrifyingly high level. This year 352 people have been killed on our roads, which is 21 more than at this time last year. I accept that behaviour on the roads is the responsibility of individuals. However, individual temperament is conditioned by a perception of whether they might get away with it. The National Safety Council has appealed to the Government to introduce random breath testing in an attempt to curb road deaths and speeding while under the influence of alcohol.</P><Col N="1490"/>
    <P>In the past week the Minister for Transport has pointed to legal difficulties with this proposal. In the same week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who continually amends the criminal law, said that he had no difficulty with random drug testing for prisoners. Can the Taoiseach explain why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can say it is possible to introduce random drug testing without any difficulty and the Minister for Transport can say there are legal difficulties with introducing random breath testing?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that unfortunately the number of road deaths in 2004 increased to 370 compared with 335 in 2003 when the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years was recorded. The number of fatalities resulting from road collision this year is a major cause for concern. So far this year there has been an increase in the number of road deaths to 353 as of 21 November compared with 331 for the same period last year. A total of 26 people have lost their lives on our roads in the past 14 days. This is a serious matter and the numbers are not heartening to anybody.</P>
    <P>While it does not give any great satisfaction to the matter, in the period since 1998 mentioned by the Deputy there has been an increase of 40% in the number of road vehicles, which is an enormous increase. There is disappointment that the impact of penalty points has waned in the period since they were first introduced. However, if we did not have penalty points, the situation would be worse again. We will move to reinforce the penalty points regime by expanding it to cover more traffic offences. The important message is that on road safety it is not possible to argue with the facts. The facts show that 86% of deaths on the roads are caused by driver error with speeding the main killer. This has changed over the years from when it was drink driving, but people must show their part in it.</P>
    <P>We now have a dedicated road safety strategy. We have introduced penalty points for speeding, not wearing seat belts, not having insurance and careless driving. This is being rolled out. As the Deputy knows, it is based on the full implementation of the technology system. Admittedly, we have had a few false starts on that. It is meant to be running by next spring.</P>

	<P>More than a few.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have established a dedicated traffic corps, headed by an assistant commissioner, and invested in a huge roads programme. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill will lead to a fully resourced body for driver testing and training. The adoption of changes in the circumstances of random breath testing, where the driver of a vehicle can be made the subject of preliminary roadside breath testing, has been the subject of considerable debate and <Col N="1491"/>consideration. The road safety regulations will be amended to deal with those issues, which have now been finalised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer the question. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said there is no problem with mandatory drug testing for prisoners, but the Minister for Transport said there are legal impediments to mandatory breath testing. Will the Taoiseach explain what they are? Will this issue be dealt with in the amendments to the regulations he mentioned? Does he intend to introduce mandatory breath testing and, if so, when?</P>
    <P>What has the Minister for Transport done about the backlog of 100,000 young drivers waiting for driving tests? The wait is costing them &euro;50 million a year extra in increased insurance. Nothing has been done about the banning of mobile phones while driving. I have seen many drivers on their phones while driving in town centres, some of them truck drivers, and they do not seem to have hands-free sets. Nothing has been done about basic training for motorcyclists. Only 34 extra garda&iacute; have been allocated for traffic corps duties this year and the corps is not a dedicated unit but is used for other purposes. We have the second worst record in Europe for drink driving checks.</P>
    <P>Tackling road safety needs strong political will and leadership. President Chirac of France has taken a personal initiative in this regard and road deaths there have reduced because of the perception of individual drivers that the state is taking a real interest in seeing that drivers drive safely. As Ministers do not appear to be prepared to do so, is the Taoiseach prepared to take a personal initiative and lead this charge so that we will not have tragic and unfortunate circumstances weekend after weekend on Irish roads?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the figures I provided, this issue is a major problem. I do not want to say anything that takes away from that. I and all my Cabinet colleagues have spent an extraordinary amount of time recently trying to resolve some of the issues, for example, the PULSE system and the extension of the penalty points system to more areas. The traffic corps is a dedicated group. The Minister has given the figures in the corps for this year and next year. An assistant commissioner now has charge of the corps, with no other responsibility.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about random breath testing, and that will be reflected in the changes. There are difficulties concerning how it is legally dealt with, but both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport have been meeting to resolve the issue and bring it forward in the road testing legislation. They believe a resolution can be found. There are legal issues with the current practice, <Col N="1492"/>which I find quite extraordinary. What can be done at night time cannot be done in daytime. I do not believe this stands up, but that is current practice. Garda&iacute; have powers to do things in the evening that they cannot do in daytime. If somebody is drink driving, there should be no difference in applying the rules and the Ministers are trying to resolve these issues.</P>
    <P>A campaign announced today will cover issues associated with the Christmas period such as drink driving. Unfortunately, I know the public is upset at times when there is more stringent enforcement of the law through more check points and breath tests etc., but I see no alternative. We cannot allow a situation continue where hundreds of people, more than one a day, die. Although people feel abused and do not like the checks, there is no alternative except to take tough action, and that is the way the Cabinet is proceeding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Taoiseach to the legislation being put through the House of Commons today by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in respect of what are known as on-the-runs. A decision seems to have arisen from a side deal between the British Government and Sinn F&eacute;in to greatly broaden the ambit of this issue. This now seems to suggest that those responsible for over 2,000 murders can, if the law ever catches up with them, no matter where they have been or where they now live, avail of the amnesty and be released on licence. While the institutions are in suspension, is it not the case that in matters such as this the Government is free and is expected to make an input? Has such an input been made into the Hain Bill? Did the Taoiseach use the British-Irish Council to offer an Irish position in terms of the Hain legislation? Will he inform the House of the Government position?</P>
    <P>There are obviously major differences between the Irish and British approaches to this issue. For example, in this jurisdiction there is no legislative overpinning of these arrangements. The Taoiseach said yesterday that the Irish numbers appeared to be approximately half a dozen and that these relate to people outside this jurisdiction. The British releases will be on licence, whereas the proposed Irish pardons will be absolute and irrevocable. Has the difference in approach between the two Governments resulted from the exclusion of the Irish Government from the negotiations on the recent concessions to the republican movement? Is that the explanation for the differences?</P>
    <P>I accept we must draw a line in the sand on this issue, but it is critical, given the number of people who lost their lives and the numbers maimed and injured, that the process is open and transparent. What is proposed in the Hain legislation means that what goes on will go on behind closed doors and there will be no victim impact statement, as requested by the SDLP. The impression is being left that the British Government, if not with the <Col N="1493"/>collusion of the Irish Government, is doing more for the perpetrators of violence than for the victims.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation being discussed in Westminster today arises from a commitment given as part of the Weston Park talks in the summer of 2001. The reason the commitment was given then was that there was an anomaly, arising from the 1998 decision on the Good Friday Agreement to allow prisoners who had committed offences before that date to be released. The anomaly was that people who were not arrested or who had never been charged were still being followed and pursued even though others who had been charged were being released. The issue was examined in 2001 and the proposals were included in the joint declaration of May 2003. This was part of the discussions that led to what was known as the acts of completion document.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct with regard to the proposals. The way the matter is being dealt with in Westminster is very different from our system. Their numbers are far more extensive than ours. I cannot be precise on our figure or whether it is half a dozen, but we believe the number is very small. The arrangement here is that an examination eligibility body will be set up to decide whether an individual is eligible for pardon. The eligibility body will have to be satisfied of the circumstances of each case. It will have to be satisfied that the person in question is not associated or affiliated in any way with an organisation that continues to engage in crime, or to threaten to engage in such activity. The eligibility body&rsquo;s findings in each case will be forwarded to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who will have to be satisfied of all the circumstances before referring the matter to the Cabinet. If the Cabinet is satisfied, the case will be presented to the President so that a pardon can be issued. That is the process that will be followed. A different system is being put in place in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Government has asked the British authorities some questions about a number of aspects of the Hain Bill, mainly to get clarification on what they are doing. They have made some changes to the Bill. The Government will examine those changes to see how they will operate.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments have agreed that the process will not commence in this jurisdiction until the British legislation has been passed. I think the British system will take some time to complete its consideration of the Bill. Some of the reasons for the delay were mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte and some of them were not. The arrangements will not apply here until some time next year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I gather from what the Taoiseach has said that he raised with the British authorities some points of clarification relating to the Hain legislation. It seems this is a matter of such grav<Col N="1494"/>ity that it requires more than simply seeking clarification. I would like to give the Taoiseach another opportunity to say whether the Government has a position on the proposals in the British legislation. He is well aware of the concerns of the SDLP, for example? Did he make the Government&rsquo;s position known in the normal way &mdash; directly to the Secretary of State, Mr. Hain, or the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair &mdash; or did he simply ask some questions to seek clarification?</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask about the different approach, which involves a presidential pardon, being taken in this jurisdiction. Can the Taoiseach cite any precedent of such a pardon being offered in a case in which there has not been a trial or conviction? Can he outline circumstances in which such a pardon should be exercised, other than as a remedy for a perceived miscarriage of justice? Is there any precedent of people being exculpated even though they have admitted they are guilty? Is it not the case that the Government has proposed this method of dealing with this matter in the hope that it will fireproof its approach from judicial review on the basis of Article 13.6 of the Constitution, which relates to the President&rsquo;s discharge of her functions? The President is subject to judicial review in respect of other decisions, such as judicial appointments.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government has pursued this approach because it is not possible to introduce legislation to deal with this matter in this jurisdiction that would exclude those who are wanted and are still on the run for the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. The Government has adopted the presidential pardon approach for that reason. There is a necessity to be open and honest with people about this major decision. For example, is there a commitment in any of the side deals which have been done that those intimidated and caused to flee Northern Ireland will be permitted to re-enter that jurisdiction? Such a commitment is necessary if we are to draw a line in the sand.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte has made a number of points. There are a number of extensions to the Hain Bill. I am not sure of the point being made by the Deputy in that regard. He is probably referring to the extension of the legislation to cover the British army. Such extensions, which have been included in the British legislation, were not discussed with the Government. They are of concern to Nationalists. The SDLP&rsquo;s proposals are well known to the Government, which has made them well known to the British authorities. The Bill has been extended beyond the areas about which the Government had been informed. The British authorities have to deal with a wider situation as they see fit. It is obvious that they believed they had to deal with certain matters by including the extended provisions relating to the British Army. We will see how that works as the debate progresses.</P><Col N="1495"/>
    <P>The agreements which have been reached in respect of those known as on-the-runs are far from side deals. I am not sure if that was the point being made by Deputy Rabbitte when he referred to side deals. When the 1998 agreement was reached, it was clear to the world that prisoners on all sides who had been sentenced for major crimes &mdash; murder in many cases &mdash; would be released. That agreement created an anomaly, however, in that people who were on the run because they had not been caught were not cleared and could still be charged. It was agreed at Weston Park, in a blaze of publicity that the anomaly in question had to be dealt with. The matter was also mentioned in the joint declaration and the acts of completion document.</P>
    <P>The arrangement that will be used in this jurisdiction, which involves a constitutional pardon, is as transparent as possible. The President, who will issue the pardon, will be able to do so only after the eligibility body has received and examined a request for a pardon and passed it on to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Department will have to be satisfied that it is appropriate to pass such a request on to the Minister, who will bring it to the Cabinet, which will decide whether to refer it to the President. The various decisions which will have to be made as part of the process will not be taken lightly. Deputy Rabbitte has rightly stated that it is believed that the process I have outlined is the best and most proper way for the Government to proceed legally. Difficulties could arise if the matter were to be dealt with in some other manner &mdash; that is a fact. The details of the proposals contained in the Hain Bill will become clearer as the debate continues. I will be glad to answer questions about such details at a later stage.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach recall the events of 14 October 2005, which was the date on which he last visited Monaghan town? Mr. Patrick Walsh bled to death in Monaghan General Hospital on that day because the surgical staff there were not allowed to perform a straightforward procedure to save his life. The doors of the operating theatre were quite literally barred to Mr. Walsh. Is the Taoiseach aware that yesterday the Health Service Executive published proposals from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the national hospitals office which, if implemented, will set in stone the scandalous conditions which led to the deaths of Mr. Walsh and others? Is the Taoiseach aware that the people of Monaghan, who have seen many services taken from Monaghan General Hospital, face the prospect of the hospital becoming just a day clinic of Cavan General Hospital? As emergency procedures will no longer be carried out at Monaghan General Hospital, ambulances will have to pass its doors even though it has all the resources needed to carry out emergency surgical procedures. As ambulances will be unable to <Col N="1496"/>deliver patients in need of stabilisation to Monaghan General Hospital, they will instead have to bring them to Cavan and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that he stated in the wake of the tragic death of Mr. Patrick Walsh that no protocols would prevent medical staff from doing their work? Does he recall further that the T&aacute;naiste referred to the policy of a hospital, as if the ban on emergency surgery at Monaghan General Hospital had been imposed by its consultant staff? Will the Taoiseach demand that the Minister for Health and Children heeds the call of the consultant surgeons in Cavan and Monaghan, who called in September for resources to be made available to Monaghan General Hospital to allow it to return to full on-call status and for the restoration of the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency unit?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate that the case of Mr. Walsh is not an isolated one and is not being raised as a parochial matter? What is happening in Monaghan General Hospital today will happen in hospitals in other communities tomorrow. Does the Taoiseach appreciate that the result of this approach is that more pressure is being placed on the facilities at Cavan General Hospital, which is already over-burdened, and other hospitals? People are lying on trolleys in the over-pressed accident and emergency units in such hospitals.</P>

   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not have time to respond to all the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, although I will bear them in mind. In November 2004, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland issued a report on surgical services at Cavan General Hospital which, it said, were &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo;. The Health Service Executive has since been addressing the issues identified in the report, in consultation with the college of surgeons, with a view to ensuring patient safety, higher standards of clinical care, maximum utilisation of all resources on both sites and local accessibility. The HSE has recruited three new permanent consultant surgeons to replace locums at Cavan and Monaghan, bringing to five the number of surgeons employed in the hospital group. It is intended that all emergency and major elective surgery should be carried out at Cavan General Hospital. Monaghan General Hospital will become the centre for all day cases and diagnostic surgical work in the Cavan and Monaghan hospital group. A consultant surgeon is to be available on site at Monaghan General Hospital on a five-day basis from Monday to Friday. General practitioners in Monaghan are to be facilitated in gaining immediate access for urgent cases to the outpatient department facilities at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Health Service Executive is satisfied that implementation of these recommendations will result in a significant increase in the level of surgical activity at Monaghan General Hospital and <Col N="1497"/>more efficient use of the personal facilities available on the site. Subject to approval by the HSE, it is anticipated that the additional beds and a theatre planned for Cavan General Hospital will be commissioned by 2007.</P>
    <P>I have not had a chance to examine this report other than to read quickly through the major series of recommendations concerning surgical services at Cavan and Monaghan announced by the National Hospitals Office and the Royal College of Surgeons. I understand that this has long been discussed by them. It is the view of the hospitals office of the HSE and the unanimous view of the Royal College of Surgeons that this is the right thing to do for patient safety, and they have made that decision.</P>

    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that last evening there were 26 patients in the surgical ward of Monaghan General Hospital and that these were inpatients who stayed throughout last night? Does the Taoiseach envisage a situation whereby that or a comparable number presenting on any given day will be transported by ambulance from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital at 5 p.m. at the close of business in Monaghan General Hospital from 1 January next? Can even an extra 26 patients be accommodated in Cavan General Hospital as of 1 January? The Cavan-Monaghan hospital group manager, Chris Lyons, said it will take 12 to 18 months to kit out the new ward accommodation in Cavan General Hospital and for it to be up and running. Where will the 26 patients in Monaghan General Hospital be accommodated in the period up to when Cavan General Hospital will be ready to receive that number?</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in recent days heavy fog and freezing conditions have made the journey time from Monaghan to Cavan much more difficult and that for people from north Monaghan in particular it will be impossible to reach Cavan within the critical hour in order that they are stabilised and properly seen to? What if the treatment room in Monaghan General Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing so. What if the treatment room in Monaghan General Hospital is another by-product of these proposals and that it will also close after 5 p.m. until 9 a.m. the following morning with no service on a Saturday or Sunday? That possibility has been cited.</P>
    <P>My last point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must conclude. He is well over time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am concluding. Professor Niall O&rsquo;Higgins, president of the RCSI, in his defence of yesterday&rsquo;s proposals, quoted international research on the basis of patient safety. The fact is that that research was administrative in nature and not based on clinical data, <Col N="1500"/>which is critical to what is happening in Monaghan General Hospital. It is totally disingenuous and misleading.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach again to intervene in Monaghan General Hospital&rsquo;s case to ensure that this further travesty is ended now.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume his seat.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Otherwise, how many deaths will it take for him, the T&aacute;naiste and others to take heed of our position?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In case the Deputy took me up wrong, I wish to clarify that I said that the Royal College of Surgeons issued a report on surgical services at Cavan General Hospital which it described as dysfunctional. I did not say that; it was stated by the Royal College of Surgeons following its examination of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Cavan-Monaghan hospital group has come together and decided that acute surgery will be carried out at Cavan General Hospital. There will be an increase in the number of consultants. The HSE is recruiting three new permanent consultant surgeons to replace the locums there. This will bring to five the number of consultants who will be there. Surgical day cases will be dealt with in Monaghan General Hospital and other patients will continue to be treated there. This is about the surgical services. Consultant surgeons will be in that hospital during the day. The acute cases will go to Cavan General Hospital in the evening time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the solution, to transfer them all to Cavan General Hospital?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday it was said that an eminent consultant had given advice to which I had not listened. Today, I advise what the eminent Royal College of Surgeons considers is the best option for the people of Monaghan.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Does it know that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is its view.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a disgrace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy does not agree with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally and absolutely reject it.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1501"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply relaying what it said. It represents all consultant surgeons in the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not. The surgeons in Monaghan and Cavan hospitals disagree with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy went four minutes over the time allocated in submitting his question. I ask him to allow the Taoiseach the courtesy of replying without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I merely stated that the Royal College of Surgeons certify every consultant surgeon in the country. This report is its major examination into this matter. I have no doubt that if Members have a different view, they will take it up with their own organisation. This examination has been under way since November 2004. Therefore, I am sure they have already submitted their views. This is the presentation of proposals that the Royal College of Surgeons believe is the best. In drawing up the arrangements, it stated that it was guided by the requirements of patient safety, good clinical care and service to the community.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
    <P>As I said in my last answer on European matters on 28 September, the Hampton Court Palace meeting would be an informal one. There was no formal agenda and as such it did not adopt formal conclusions. I did, however, receive a letter from the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, in advance outlining his thoughts on what the meeting should discuss. The Prime Minister proposed that the theme of the discussion be the opportunities and challenges of globalisation. In this context, the discussion focused on the competitive challenges we all face from the rise of China, India and other emerging economies. The European Commission also delivered a report entitled European Values in the Globalised World.</P>
    <P>At the meeting, I emphasised the need for the Union to take the competition from third countries into account when making and implementing EU policies, particularly in areas such as state aids. At the suggestion of the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, we agreed that there needed to be further work in key areas such as research and development, the demographic challenge and the development of our universities, energy, security and immigration. The European Commission is to bring forward preparations over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The meeting also approved statements in support of the victims of the south Asian earthquake, condemning the appalling remarks about Israel of the Iranian President and calling on the Syrian Government to co-operate unconditionally with the UN investigation into the assassination of the Lebanese Prime Minister. Overall, the meeting <Col N="1503"/>was a useful opportunity for the Heads of State or Government to have an open discussion about some of the key challenges facing the Union.</P>
    <P>At Hampton Court Palace, I briefly met the outgoing Prime Minister of Poland, Marek Belka, and former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schr&ouml;der at what was the last meeting of Heads of State or Government they would attend. I wished them both well for the future. I have not yet received an agenda for the European Council due to take place on 15 to 16 December.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The newly elected first woman Chancellor in Germany, Angela Merkel, sees the European Union as a partner to Germany and not as an opposite bloc to the United States. Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to meet with the new German Chancellor? Obviously the restoration of a strong economy in Germany is of major influence in terms of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Lisbon Agenda, to which the Taoiseach previously referred, is obviously not being completed in the way EU leaders had envisaged. The European entity is very much behind the United States in terms of job creation. In this country there are 300,000 people working in manufacturing services. That is the same number as seven years ago, except that almost a third of those jobs are new, demonstrating that one has to work very hard to stand still. In a European context and given the fact that we do not have any university in the top 250 on the world list, how does the Taoiseach see the pressures on manufacturing services being affected by European leaders&rsquo; decisions in terms of making it easier for companies to do their business? Given the anti-competitive costings that now apply to many Irish manufacturing services, how does he see that challenge being addressed both in Ireland and from a European perspective?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is good that the situation has stabilised following the early September elections in Germany. It is also good that Angela Merkel has been elected Chancellor and that an administration is in place. She has gone to meet President Chirac on her first visit, obviously to show that this strong axis of Europe that has been in existence for so many decades will continue under her leadership. That is the way it has been presented in Germany and in France this morning. I previously wrote to congratulate her and I wrote again yesterday following her election as Chancellor. I look forward to meeting her at an early date, as soon as that proves possible.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Kenny said about the Lisbon Agenda is correct. We will now be heading to the Spring Council and even though it is six years since the then Portuguese Prime Minister, Antonio Gutierrez, started the Lisbon strategy, while there has been implementation of many aspects of it, employment has not been a good one in many countries in Europe, including the <Col N="1504"/>major economies where unemployment is in excess of 10%. These countries have not been able to get any kind of bounce out of the initiatives of the Lisbon Agenda.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues have been completed but there are areas of deficiency where the Americans still have a clear lead on us, such as in research and development and in the range and way in which they manage to develop so many different aspects of their economy. They have done that very successfully and continue to do it. Manufacturing jobs in Europe will continue to decline for the simple reason that in Bangalore in south-eastern China people are working for a euro or two a day as compared to our equivalent rate. This will not happen anywhere in Europe. People are still working 12 hours a day, six days a week. The labour market and technology in China is top class due to the investment it has got from many parts of the world. Therefore, European manufacturing in many traditional sectors in particular will not be able to compete. There is no possibility that this will change. Therefore, we must continue to do what we have been successfully doing here, although it is demanding, that is to go up the scale, get value-added and upgrade skills.</P>
    <P>Traditional manufacturing jobs must now become sophisticated technology jobs. This is the part of the world in which medicines and drugs are now being made. In all these categories we are up there with the top quality in the world. This is creating a different kind of job. Where one time we would have just been involved in packing and distribution, drugs, chemicals and surgical devices are being made in this country and moved around the world. This is also the case with information and communications technology in the wider world, in the new bio-pharma plants like Wyeth and the extensions to a number of others. This is where the jobs are for the future. Unfortunately, the days of manufacturing clothes, plastics, buttons, sweets and other such industries are gone and we will not be able to compete in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s last point was about competitiveness. We must strive to win in every area where we can be competitive. In the education sector our universities are still doing very well, as is the case with training and in our aptitude to work. I accept there are arguments about the top 250 universities. Many of these universities operate very tight faculties. They take just a few faculties and develop them at the expense of everything else. The facts can be overstated. If these universities were as great as the list suggested, how come the leaders of the world in business and banking are not graduates of those universities? I have my doubts about these issues. When one looks at some of the universities and checks around at where the top people in the world are, how come they are not graduates of those universities if they are all they are made out to be? The best of luck to them.</P><Col N="1505"/>
    <P>We have to continue to develop our universities in Europe to the best of our ability and have more collaboration between them. It is very important that people work together in research and development. In fairness to the universities on the island of Ireland they now all work far more closely together, which is good. They have moved away from the sensitivities of the past. Now, whenever we meet them in Government they are meeting together. They are working on joint programmes, research efforts, the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and Science Foundation Ireland. These groups are working and bidding for those universities in a very positive way that is working <?oasys _ch?>successfully.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Listening to the Taoiseach I expect universities would say there is a need for improvement and things can be done. To listen to him one would think it was all fine. I wish to ask a question based on the outcome of the informal summit held in Hampton Court. As the Taoiseach stated, the summit did not have a formal agenda. It has been described in the media as a non-committal chat. It is more often referred to by virtue of the fact that it failed to offer solutions in regard to the ill-effects of globalisation or in progressing the issue of the EU budget. The Taoiseach outlined some of them in the previous reply. In that context, does he have a view on the European globalisation adjustment fund that the Commission proposed and that has been backed by the British Prime Minister but not at the time by the German and the Danish Prime Ministers?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach have a view on one aspect of the summit which people may have overlooked, namely a common energy policy that was backed by the informal summit? One central part of that which would be of huge concern to many people in Ireland is the approval given to nuclear power being &ldquo;taken forward on a European basis&rdquo;. Did the Taoiseach offer a position on this? Will he indicate what discussions took place on this energy policy? Was any attention paid to the potential of other types of energy sources, such as renewables or biofuels?</P>
    <P>I note the General Affairs and External Relations Council announced the formation of 18 battle groups involving 26 countries. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether Ireland is one of the countries involved and whether the December summit will include elaboration on this arrangement? The Minister for Defence promised a decision on this issue in December. Will that be announced at the mid-December EU summit? Will we have an opportunity to debate it here first?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the education issue, I do not mean more is not to be done. I stated that European universities get bad coverage because they are not listed among the top universities. There is a need for more resources and more <Col N="1506"/>people. World leaders of all faculties come from European universities and have done incredibly well in building up the business. That is the only point. As more of our young people go to university, more money is required for research and development. We invested hundreds of millions in PRTLI and Science Foundation Ireland and that must continue.</P>
    <P>The EU meeting was not like the summer or autumn meetings. It was a debate on the challenges facing Europe today, and examined economic challenges such as whether Germany will get off the ground again economically and the problems in the French economy. It considered a broad view of China and India, as not only Europe but countries throughout the world are increasingly concerned about the strides they make. We identified it many years ago. The reality is they turn out more highly qualified people from their universities. More people carry out research and they receive investment from all over the world. This makes them far stronger. All of those issues were discussed.</P>
    <P>Energy issues are taken into account because of costs, particularly this year when energy prices increased by approximately 20% everywhere. Concerns were expressed about that, and on issues surrounding ongoing needs for energy resources, such as gas from Russia. The nuclear issue was not discussed in great detail but it is raising its head and it seems the British Government will go down that road again. It is a strong supporter of nuclear energy. The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, went a different direction and closed nuclear energy stations. I do not know what the new Chancellor, Angela Merkel, will do. The French believe in it and continue to invest in it. They do not believe in anything else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>They are locked into it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are, and other countries are re-examining it because they believe it is cost-efficient, competitive, safer, cleaner, and involves new technologies. All of the arguments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach promoting it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not. I do not agree with it, I am only explaining that it is out there. I am surprised at how the British Government is moving on it, but that is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extremely costly. Will the Taoiseach find out about that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the way it is going. I am describing the trend.</P>
    <P>Battle groups were not discussed but Europe&rsquo;s readiness to deal with humanitarian matters under the Petersberg tasks remains a major issue. Kofi Annan made it clear that the only way to deal with conflicts is to have groups that can take <Col N="1507"/>action on a regional basis. He is pressing hard that people engage in this and commit to it. We are examining our situation. One way or another, the maximum number of people we can afford to have abroad is less than 1,000 at approximately 880 or 890. We have those commitments already and even if we did not, it would not add to the forces in a major way. We will reach a conclusion. Battle groups are necessary to deal with the type of humanitarian issues that have happened before and will happen again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>More than that is involved.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are necessary to deal with the issues. We must reach a conclusion on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should have a debate before he decides.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree an impression is abroad that the EU is treading water? Will he point out to the House any outcome of the London summit that would contradict that view? Will he raise the matter of the sugar regime at the mid-December summit? Does he agree with the serious concerns, particularly in the Mallow region, for the future of the facility at Mallow? I had the opportunity to visit it earlier this year. I presume the Taoiseach heard the same presentation from the company. The largest investment programme ever engaged in by Greencore is in the revamped factory at Mallow. Does the Taoiseach agree that whatever about the professionalism of management, the willingness of the workforce or the capacity of the factory that farmers will not continue to supply beet and it will not be economically viable for them to do so if the present proposals go ahead? Does he intend personally to bring this issue to the mid-December summit?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, until leadership issues are resolved in Germany and Poland, which is a large and significant country, not too much business will be done. The British Government had to deal with that ongoing situation throughout its Presidency. The French, for numerous reasons, are not focusing on any major issue at present. Those reasons include their own difficulties, the aftermath of its constitutional vote and the fact that President Chirac was ill for a time. It is true that great initiatives were not taken during this six months. The major challenge will be to finalise the financial perspectives. That will be a crucial issue.</P>
    <P>Having been involved for a long time, both as Minister for Finance and as Taoiseach, it amazes me how Europe does not put more energy into fixing this issue. I repeated that at meetings and to a number of colleagues in recent weeks. If it is not fixed by Christmas it will not be able to get through the process. It must go through the Par<Col N="1508"/>liament which takes quite a period of time, after which it must be placed in the programmes and then the entire issue must be debated and rolled-out in each country. Only a year remains to do that. It is a dangerous situation. When Ireland had the Presidency, I went into detail on how this system operates and works. If it is not agreed at Christmas, and I would not suggest that people put too much of their hard-earned euro on it, we will be in an extremely difficult position next year.</P>
    <P>I will certainly raise the sugar issue if it is not already resolved one way or the other. The agricultural meeting takes place this week and reform of the EU sugar regime will dominate those discussions. We met the IFA last week, we had dealings with farming bodies, and many meetings with our departmental officials will have taken place prior to next week&rsquo;s meeting. The drive for this is linked to Mr. Mandelson and the WTO meetings in a few weeks time. Everyone accepts the need for reform and there are internal EU pressures to bring the sugar industry into line with other agricultural sectors. Unlike in most other sectors, the regime has remained unchanged for 40 years. The present regime will end in summer 2006 and arrangements must be put in place to avoid a legal vacuum at that stage. There is also international pressure for reform from those who favour helping Africa. They have lobbied on this all year and the everything but arms agreement brings this to the fore.</P>
    <P>In the summer it was difficult to find space to express the view on Mallow, which is related to this, because we were all concerned with global issues. The everything but arms agreement gives duty free access to sugar imports from the less developed countries from 2009. The Doha round of trade negotiations and the ruling of the WTO panel against EU exports of C sugar, which must be implemented by 22 May next are further reasons reform must happen.</P>
    <P>From the outset we have availed of every opportunity to highlight the serious repercussions the reform proposals would have for Irish industry. Beet has long been a valuable cash crop for Irish farmers, as well as playing a significant role in the tillage cycle. Some 3,700 beet growers and producers, whose representatives I met last week, and the 1,000 people employed in the processing sector could be wiped out if the Commission goes ahead with the proposals in this regard. Some take the view that this does not matter, but we take an alternative view. It is extremely difficult and while I do not want to discuss issues of pricing, the price offered would make sugar production unviable for farmers. It would wipe them out with very little warning or interim period and would create major difficulties.</P>
    <P>We have made the case as best we can and have lobbied intensely on this matter at every source. There is not much sympathy for Ireland, as is usual on such issues, and the Presidency does not show much sympathy either. We have <Col N="1509"/>mounted a campaign as best we can and, as I stated consistently in the House, we must seek financial perspectives that bring us to the 2013 position and protect the 2002 CAP agreement as best we can. There is not much sympathy for this country because we are seen to have received &euro;1.5 billion for 30 years &mdash; Deputies will be familiar with the arguments.</P>
    <P>What will happen after 2013 will be horrendous for Irish agriculture and people in the industry must make changes. As we approach that time they cannot hold their hand to the gate. I do not expect to be making this point here after 2013 but as long as we keep objecting and not making the necessary reforms, many of our people will face this challenge. Those involved must face up to this period of change, which I have seen coming since the Essen meeting in 1992. The current arrangements will not last beyond 2013. The agriculture industry must be honest because prices offered will not be economically viable and the Exchequer will not and should not subsidise farmers. That will create major difficulties.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the proposed EU budget as discussed in Britain, offers very little to the 98 million people at risk from poverty across Europe and more than 20 million unemployed people? The broad economic and political priorities, as laid out in the budget, are not geared to tackle these problems. The contrary is the case and the political and social thrust of what was discussed has contributed to the issues and problems to which I refer.</P>
    <P>In that context did the Taoiseach use the opportunity of the European Council meeting to raise the issue, formally or informally, of the intention of Irish Ferries to dump its Irish-based workforce, to introduce a &euro;3.50 per hour rate of pay, to exploit overseas nationals, to flout Irish industrial relations good practice that has been built up over many years, and to do that under a flag of convenience? Does the Taoiseach agree that the only way to deal with Irish Ferries is through international co-operation and legal changes and that the EU has a critical role to play in that regard?</P>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach called and, if not, will he call on the EU to take the lead in this respect, particularly on intra-EU ferry crossings so that the EU would ensure all ferry services operating under flags of convenience are obliged to operate best practice in respect of industrial relations that apply across the EU? That must include pay and conditions and adherence to minimum standards applicable across the EU.</P>

	<P>Did the Taoiseach not raise it informally?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1510"/>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the issue of Irish Ferries and we have examined what can be done on a European and international basis. The EU has not agreed regulations on this, mainly because many international ferries coming in from large ports of the world are importing into Europe and exporting, but are not bound by conditions there. It is not seen as practical to control them. This is not inter-Europe trade without external involvement. That is the difficulty and it is felt it is not possible to control this.</P>
    <P>I hope Irish Ferries will follow the Labour Court rules though it does not seem as if people want to follow the recommendation. Ferries are of major importance to us because we depend on them for imports and exports. People involved should attempt to resolve this matter rather than entering the dangerous position of conflict, causing major difficulties in terms of imports and exports. All issues in this matter should be resolved but I do not get a sense that people are prepared to do so.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been examined and I do not see the European Union introducing, certainly in the short term, a regime to control this. I do not see it as something that will prove practical. It has been examined many times but I do not think it will resolve itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s appointee to the European Commission, Mr. McCreevy, is weighing in on the side of exploitative employers rather than protection for workers, as evidenced in the dispute in Sweden involving a Latvian construction company. What position will the Taoiseach adopt at the next EU Council meeting on the proposed services directive? With the Irish Ferries plan to replace trade union workers on decent wages and conditions with exploited labour from eastern Europe in front of his eyes, will he oppose the proposal that originated with the former Commissioner, Mr. Bolkenstein? That proposal attacks workers&rsquo; rights within the European Union and endorses the replacement of jobs with decent wages and conditions, with exploited labour.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Cabinet preached to us in the course of recent referenda about the great social charter, freedom and security and workers&rsquo; rights within the European Union. How does he tally that with what he has just said? He virtually threw his hands in the air with regard to Irish Ferries and said nothing can be done within the European Union to prevent companies exploiting flags of convenience to ply EU waters with impunity. The Taoiseach must be mindful that the reason the working class in France rejected the proposed European constitution was because of its genuine fears about the undermining of proper jobs, wages and conditions and the abuse <Col N="1511"/>of migrant labour. Does he agree we have enough examples in this country of a cynical abuse of migrant labour? In that context, I am not even referring to the most blatant abuse, but that which takes place within the law. Will the Taoiseach stand up for workers&rsquo; rights in Europe or will he be part of the neo-liberal attack on those rights and conditions?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is a few months behind because we joined with others in making sure the services directive did not go through in the form that he fears. We stopped the process from going ahead in early summer. The proposed services directive, which was withdrawn then, is under consideration in the European Parliament, where hundreds of amendments have been tabled. We are awaiting the Parliament&rsquo;s final opinion on the directive.</P>
    <P>The Government has consistently supported the need for a services directive, which it believes is essential for the successful completion of the Internal Market. Ireland has much to gain from such a directive. At the same time we recognise that we must ensure the concerns that have been expressed, including those put forward by President Chirac and I &mdash; we were arguing this when very few others were &mdash; concerning the views of the ETUC about the directive&rsquo;s implications for workers, be taken fully into account.</P>
    <P>The Vaxholm Laval case in Sweden, upon which Commissioner McCreevy commented, has been referred to the Swedish labour court and judgment is awaited. The matter is currently before the court and the issues relate primarily to a Swedish internal matter so I will not discuss those particular issues.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Social Charter gives workers rights all over Europe. A total of 35 or 36 provisions in the charter have been implemented and that gives workers protection. However, there are difficulties in some areas and the flags of convenience is one such area. It raises the question of international waters as opposed to European waters. The flags of convenience are for international waters and have always been interpreted as such and the difficulty lies in trying to ring-fence something that is international as opposed to European.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two suggestions for the Taoiseach on matters that he might consider raising at the European Council. The first is the development of a European perspective on wind energy. We face a &euro;450 million fine for not complying with the Kyoto Protocol. There does not appear to be a European perspective on this issue. Engineers from various countries have come here and said that within 20 years we could be 80% self-sufficient in terms of energy contributed from wind. I spoke to Airtricity recently, which wants European backing to build a 50,000 kilowatt station off the north coast of England. <Col N="1512"/>This is worthy of consideration by European leaders. We need a European perspective on wind energy. Is this an issue that the Taoiseach would consider raising at an appropriate time during the EU Council meeting?</P>
    <P>My second suggestion is that the European Heads of Government should put an initiative in place to deal with the scourge of paedophilia, which is trans-border in nature and a problem in every country. There should be a European perspective and analysis of paedophilia, its causes, genetic or otherwise, and how best the problem can be dealt with, not on a country by country basis but on a Europe wide basis. Is that something the Taoiseach would consider raising at the European Council meeting?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that up to now we have been very good Europeans but the fact that we may lose our sugar industry means we must question our position? Is compensation an issue in the ongoing negotiations and does he agree there should be a sugar quota in place? We have had a sugar quota of 200,000 tonnes for the last four years. Does the Taoiseach believe that should remain in place because it is countries that have a quota assigned to them that can export into the European Union? I join Deputy Rabbitte in asking if the matter can be raised at the December meeting.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question on renewable energy, 13% of our energy is currently generated from renewable resources. We have progressed and pushed the wind energy agenda and we will reach our targets. The Government is very supportive of wind energy and there are many initiatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we reach our potential? That is the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If we can get co-operation on the issue, we will progress further.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there has been any initiative with regard to paedophilia. I will check, but Deputy Kenny is correct in so far as it is a problem everywhere because the individuals concerned move around. I will raise that matter at the meeting.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Sherlock, compensation is an issue. However, we have argued that we would rather maintain our position, as difficult as that is. Different aspects of compensation have been raised but I am not sure it will cover adequately what the EU is trying to do. Perhaps compensation is a short-term mechanism to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>The argument within the WTO on the food area always sounds credible, although Europe is doing more than anywhere else, namely, that we should allow imports from everywhere else. Europe allows imports to a greater extent than others. When items such as sugar and fruit from <Col N="1513"/>African countries and elsewhere are allowed in, that has an effect on supply and demand and undermines trade. There is a knock-on effect. The simplistic view in the developing world is that it does not matter, the effect is not too big or small. However, Deputy Sherlock and I have to deal with the individuals who are affected by imports. The fact is that the decisions made and the lobbying done to date has led to a position where the price being offered for sugar will simply eliminate the industry here in its entirety. If we continue on that road other industries will follow.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mandelson wants to agree everything in advance of the Doha round. There are other ways of negotiating and I would do it differently if I were in that position. We have made our point clearly and will fight to get an agreement on the sugar issue. Compensation is a major factor.</P>

   <Title>Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il and on my own behalf I extend deepest sympathies to the family and friends of our late colleague, Liam Lawlor, on the sad occasion of his tragic death on 22 October. During recent weeks our thoughts have also been with Liam&rsquo;s wife, Hazel, his daughter, Ciara, and sons, Niall, Gerald and Shane. In that time Liam&rsquo;s family have borne their private grief with enormous public dignity and composure.</P>
    <P>The news of Liam&rsquo;s sudden death reached my colleagues and me during the Ard-Fheis in Killarney and it is always a shock when somebody one knows so well dies suddenly. Liam&rsquo;s death was a particular shock because he was a man of such extraordinary energy and it was especially hard to believe he was gone. Liam and I entered this House in 1977 and I have shared many occasions with him, both at home and abroad, in the years since. I worked with him throughout the country in an organisational capacity on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il in the early 1980s. I was also involved <Col N="1514"/>with him in many Oireachtas committees in my earlier years.</P>
    <P>Liam was born 60 years ago in October 1945 and educated at Synge Street CBS and Bolton Street College of Technology. He was involved in much of the city&rsquo;s and county&rsquo;s activities over the years. Before he entered politics he ran a successful refrigeration company.</P>
    <P>When he was elected to the D&aacute;il as Member of the three-seat Dublin West constituency in 1977 at the age of 33, he dedicated himself to looking after his constituents and constituency. His record in elections was mixed. He lost his seat and regained it in 1982 only to lose it again. In 1985 he won a local authority seat, topping the poll, and won his D&aacute;il seat back again in 1987. He retired in 2002. From 1987 to 1989 he served as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, which he particularly enjoyed, and held various positions on other committees.</P>
    <P>He was an outstanding athlete and played hurling for Dublin at senior level as well as at club level. He also represented Leinster in the Railway Cup when the competition was tough. He ran the Dublin city marathon and was therefore a fit and energetic person.</P>
    <P>The bare facts of Liam&rsquo;s political and sporting life do little to convey the real man. A phrase often used to describe him in the days after his death was &ldquo;larger than life&rdquo;. He was a big man with a great gift for humour, conversation and storytelling. He was good company and through all the ups and downs he was never dull or less than entertaining. He never appeared to let things get him down and was a vivid and engaging colleague around the House. Through the many tough times he endured he managed to project that bright side. Liam was a man of many parts.</P>
    <P>Liam&rsquo;s wife, Hazel, and members of his family join us today in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. Hazel, her daughter, Ciara, and sons, Niall, Gerald and Shane, knew a Liam Lawlor few of us knew. He was a family man, a husband and father whom they will miss because he will never come back to them again.</P>
    <P>The circumstances of Liam&rsquo;s death were surrounded in the same blaze of controversy that surrounded much of his political life. Much has been said and written about the manner in which his death was reported. There are lessons for us in politics and for the media who perform a valuable service in reporting our work. We should remember that charity is not the enemy of justice and neither justice nor charity is the enemy of the truth. We all have our faults and moral judgment is something we should pass sparingly. The finest testaments to Liam, and the ones he would have been most proud of, are the extraordinary grace and dignity of his wife, Hazel, who I have been honoured to know for decades, and the eloquent defence of their deceased father by his loyal and loving children.</P><Col N="1515"/>
    <P>In these brief words I extend my condolences to Hazel, Niall, Gerald, Shane and especially Ciara, who worked with me during my period as Leader of the Opposition, and wish them well into the future. It is an honour today to join with all the other leaders in testament to a person who was controversial but a good guy and a nice person around this House.

	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I extend my sincere sympathy to the family of the late Liam Lawlor, his wife, Hazel, his sons, Niall, Gerard and Shane, and his daughter, Ciara. The name of Liam Lawlor is synonymous with political controversy and equally synonymous with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>
    <P>I will say a few words today about Liam Lawlor, not the politician or former member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party but the individual. I knew him for many years from his election to this House in 1977 and while he and I had different political agendas and views, on a personal basis he and I enjoyed a close relationship, principally because of a mutual interest in sport. The Taoiseach will recall the first visit to Islington by a team from this House, attended by between 4,000 and 5,000 people, intended to break down suspicions and build relationships with the British House of Commons. Liam Lawlor was a central figure on that team. I remember competing with him in the &ldquo;Superstars&rdquo; of the day, running around the steeplechase course at Belfield. He shouted from behind me it was worse than the Grand National. I recall playing in a charity golf event with him in Luttrellstown where we were lucky enough to win second prize, a bottle of wine. When the names were called out to receive this unique gift, he said they would not know whether to laugh or cry.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>He was a larger than life character, obviously adored by his family to whom he was so devoted. Anyone here who knew Liam Lawlor well knew what a family man he was and those feelings were reciprocated because when I visited the Lawlor house the night before he was buried, I met a family numbed with loss. The sadness of his passing so far from home shocked them to the core. The immediate and wider Lawlor family, close-knit as they are, can never be the same again now he has gone.</P>
    <P>Personally, Liam Lawlor was a kind and generous man. In the days after his death, I am sure his family searched the acres of news print to find a trace of the father, husband and brother they knew and loved so well. When James Joyce was working as a journalist for an Italian newspaper, he wrote about the Irish and how, despite our political differences, we never failed to show great reverence for the dead. Today, being sensitive to the great love and respect Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s family had for him, the Fine Gael Party wishes to <Col N="1516"/>show that reverence and to keep that tradition.

   <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in offering our sincere sympathy and condolences to the family of the late Liam Lawlor. It ought to be remembered that the past six or seven years cannot have been easy for the Lawlor family. They could not have anticipated his premature passing in the tragic accident in Moscow. That tragedy was exacerbated considerably by its manner of reporting in some sections of the media. I know how unnecessarily wounding and deeply hurtful that was for the family. I know it directly from my neighbour of more than 20 years, Noel Lawlor. For him and his decent and honourable family, the passing of Liam Lawlor was unnecessarily exacerbated by the tenor of the reporting of his departure.</P>
    <P>We operate in this House on occasions like this on the principle of <i>de mortuis nil nise bonum</i> or, as we say in Ireland, one does not speak ill of the dead, and I do not intend to depart from that stricture. I had more than my fair share of conflict with the late Deputy Liam Lawlor. I would like to be able to say that he had used his prodigious talents exclusively in the interests of public service and to enhance politics, but I cannot say that. Today, however, is not the time to assess the political contribution of Liam Lawlor, rather it is an occasion to allow all sides of this House to offer our sincere condolences to his direct family and his extended family, and I join in doing that.</P>

	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I too express my sympathy to Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s family, particularly his wife, Hazel, his children, Niall, Shane, Gerald and Ciara and his brother, Noel.</P>
    <P>When we heard in the early afternoon of 22 October of Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s death, we all found it difficult to believe. One hoped it was a rumour that was not true, as often happens in public life. That he should die within a few days of reaching his 61st birthday was a tragedy that is too much for any family. He did not look 61, he looked much younger. Those who did not know him may not have realised he was such a big man. He was full of energy, an able person and, as the Taoiseach acknowledged, a great spokesperson. To die so suddenly, so unfairly and so far away from home caused enormous and unimaginable pain for his family. As other Members said, the appallingly inaccurate reports at the time of his death was a cross no family should have to bear, least of all Hazel Lawlor and her family. The strength, courage and dignity she and her children showed at the time of his death is something of which he would have been very proud. It is a great example to all of us. May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom comhbhr&oacute;n an Chomhaontais Ghlais a chur in i&uacute;l do mhuintir Liam Lawlor, to Hazel, Gerald, Ciara, Shane, Niall and the wider family. This is an opportunity to hear from people who knew Liam first-hand. Newspapers are generally known for reporting the truth but, unfortunately, in this case people reported stories that were not true and that has been proven beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>It was clear to those of us who knew Liam Lawlor that he was a very capable and talented Deputy. He was not the type of Deputy who was in any way happy to tread water and pass time, he was always doing something. One got the impression that he was never content just to be a Deputy. When I was first elected in 1992, he sat in the Government backbenches. Very often Deputies sitting decided they would either sit at the back or on the Front Bench, but they would not sit anywhere in the middle. Liam Lawlor was certainly one of the Deputies who stuck rigidly to the back seat, waiting for his promotion. It did not come, of course, and the tragedy is that Liam is now gone from us.</P>
    <P>I often wondered what would have happened if he had been given an official role within Fianna F&aacute;il to be friendly to new Deputies because he was generally the person one could always depend on to engage in conversation and find out what other people were interested in. I would even go so far as to say that he liked to act the role of Minister. He certainly could carry off that role-play with aplomb. I still have a letter from Liam Lawlor as if he had been Minister, telling me what the Minister with responsibility for Sellafield was doing about the situation, as he knew my interest in the issue. That letter now takes on a new significance. In many ways it is a reminder of the Liam Lawlor that is not reported in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Taoiseach and others said about his being larger than life, there was much more to Liam Lawlor than what was reported in the newspapers. It is important on a day like today to recall this and to let his family know that we knew the Liam Lawlor who is not reported in the newspapers. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm uasal.</P>

	<P>On my own behalf and on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I extend our sincere sympathy to the wife, daughter, sons and wider family of the late Deputy Liam Lawlor. Over the short number of years of my service from 1997, I had the opportunity to engage with Deputy Lawlor. He was, as other Members described, a very engaging Member of the House. In thinking back over his death, while I am sure that throughout his lifetime he was very proud of his family, there could hardly have been a time during his life when he could have been as proud as I have no doubt he must have been at witnessing their courage and dignity over those terrible days following his tragic death. This has been noted by the entire nation.</P><Col N="1518"/>
    <P>I will not let the opportunity go by without reiterating my belief that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people were shocked and vexed at the outrageous and false reports that sections of the Irish media were so eager to peddle as fact following his death. To inflict such hurt and pain on a grieving family would be viewed by many as unacceptable even if the claims were true. To do so when there was no basis to their scurrilous reports is viewed by the overwhelming majority as unforgivable.</P>

	<P>Many in west Dublin were shocked to learn of the death of Liam Lawlor in a Moscow traffic accident. For Hazel and a fine family in Niall, Gerald, Shane and Ciara, and many friends in the area, there was understandable shock and horror at the episode.</P>
    <P>Many more who did not know Liam Lawlor well were shocked at how the press reported these events. The inaccuracies have been brought to light but despite that no proper apology or explanation has been given to the people of Ireland as to why these inaccurate statements were published. There is also the issue of the fundamental lack of respect for the funeral custom that has always obtained in this country. Deputy Kenny touched on this earlier and Deputy Rabbitte quoted one of the noblest Romans of all in that context. I read in one newspaper the comment that the remains of the disgraced Deputy were now arriving in Dublin. To my mind, the disgrace lies with the person who would write such a thing for publication. It belongs to those who abuse their pulpit in that manner.</P>
    <P>We all knew former Deputy Liam Lawlor well. It is worth stating that no adverse finding was made against him by any court or tribunal prior to his death. He had a procedural <i>contretemps</i> which led to his incarceration by a particular tribunal but it did not involve an adverse finding related to his political conduct. History must judge these matters now and make the final assessment referred to by Deputy Rabbitte. No doubt that assessment will be made, although I am not sure any tribunal can arrive at a definitive conclusion given that he is no longer in a position to contradict whatever is said against him. Many in the legal profession believe he would have been an outstanding advocate. He displayed an extraordinary forensic skill in his dealings with the tribunals in recent years.</P>
    <P>He was brought up in the Moracrete Cottages off the Crumlin Road in Dublin and was educated in Synge Street CBS and Bolton Street College of Technology. He belonged, and he never made any apologies for it, to the working class of this city. He had a certain suspicion of those who claimed to have a superior insight into the requirements of that group. As a constituency Deputy, he was tireless in his efforts for the <Col N="1519"/>poorer elements in his constituency. He gave time and effort to them and no person&rsquo;s problem was too insignificant.</P>
    <P>He hurled for Dublin and for Leinster in the Railway Cup. He was tough on the field and courteous off it. My late father fought seven election campaigns with him &mdash; I hesitate to say against him because they got along well &mdash; but those were tough campaigns, and I had the pleasure of fighting one campaign with him. He certainly knew how to campaign, and I do not mean that in a derogatory manner. He had a great insight into the political psychology of the voting public. He had an immense grasp of detail and a practical way of advancing the case of any constituent. Anyone who fought an election with or against him will testify to his extraordinary ability to mobilise voters. We are often charged with clientilism, a code for saying that we stay close to our voters. As long as we maintain the single transferable vote in the multi-member constituency, we will continue to have clientilism whether we like it or not and Liam Lawlor was certainly able to practise that.</P>
    <P>He was a man of immense intelligence, there is no question of that. He was a self-made man and his ambitions, like many self-made men, knew no bounds. He was very proud of his family and I am glad to see Hazel and his brother here today, and others of his family, and I extend my sympathy to Hazel and his children, Niall, Gerald, Shane and Ciara. I agree with all other Deputies that they have conducted themselves with tremendous dignity during the recent obsequies at the airport and Lucan. No doubt they have very happy memories and I hope what was said today will add to those memories.</P>

	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party in west Dublin, I offer my condolences to Hazel, to her children, to Noel and to the extended Lawlor family.</P>
    <P>Like everyone else, I was shocked at Liam&rsquo;s horrific death in the car crash in Moscow. To die so far from home and from the family who loved him so much is dreadful enough but the media coverage that followed his death must have added immeasurably to the burden of grief and trauma Hazel and the family have suffered.</P>
    <P>As has been said by the Taoiseach and others, Liam was a large man but he was strikingly intelligent and had an extraordinary intellectual capacity for analysing problems and acting on his constituents&rsquo; behalf. His son, Niall, put it best when he described his father&rsquo;s robustness in an interview with Pat Kenny. As someone who went up against Liam on a number of occasions, I can confirm that. It is no secret that Liam and I clashed repeatedly about planning issues in west Dublin but that debate is for another time. We had a truce over the Liffey Valley project, where we worked on a cross-party basis to ensure the <Col N="1520"/>important greenery that remained would be preserved.</P>
    <P>I know the pride Liam took in his family because he often spoke to me about his children and, particularly, his grandchildren. In all the current grief, it is wonderful to know that he lived to see and enjoy the success of his children and found a new life in the grandchildren who have come along.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many people remember election day 2002. In west Dublin it was accompanied by monsoon type rain and flooding. At 7 p.m. I took refuge like a drowned rat in Myo&rsquo;s in Castleknock. When I went in the door feeling miserable and dejected, I met Liam and a group of his golfing buddies who had abandoned their game. They were consoling me but Liam told me I would win. He was always confident about his predictions and in that he was right. It seemed odd, however, to have an election in west Dublin without Liam and his fabulous election machine.</P>
    <P>I have known of Liam Lawlor since my youth. He was friendly with many of my relations, particularly the Doyles, an old Fianna F&aacute;il family, and he and I often talked about our experiences growing up in working class Dublin. He was a man of tremendous ability and it is hard to think he is gone. I have always admired Hazel and nothing became her more than the way in which she behaved with such extraordinary dignity and courage under a media onslaught.</P>
    <P>Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my sympathy and that of the local Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in Clondalkin and Lucan to the family of Liam Lawlor, Hazel, Ciara, Niall, Gerald and Shane, on his tragic death. Many of the local members have expressed their sympathies to the family and many attended the funeral, including Councillor Jim Daly. Jim often mentioned Liam, saying, &ldquo;Liam is one hell of a tough man and I have the scars to prove it&rdquo;, but he was referring to the hurling field. The political and sporting relationship goes back a long way. I also express my sympathy to Noel Lawlor, Liam&rsquo;s brother, who is a member of the local Fianna F&aacute;il organisation in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>I never served with Liam Lawlor on the local authority or in the House. I contested the local elections in 1999 with him and, upon Liam&rsquo;s retirement from politics in 2002, I was elected to the D&aacute;il. A procedure is observed when new Members meet former Members who return to the House and visit the D&aacute;il bar. I recall the first time I met Liam in the House. A number of colleagues introduced me to the former Member, Liam Lawlor, but little did they know I knew him anyway. Liam pretended he had never met me and I pretended I had never met him so one can imagine the banter that ensued. We had dinner together that night and Liam, as always, was colourful, full of life and witty, and he was an absolutely engaging host. He was a pleasure to be <Col N="1521"/>with and I met him in the House on a number of occasions subsequently.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has experienced a tragic death such as that experienced by the Lawlors will understand their trauma, pain and grief, particularly when Liam&rsquo;s death occurred far from home. They will acknowledge the search for answers about what happened, how it happened and the manner of a loved one&rsquo;s death. It is tragic and painful for a family to experience that. However, the Lawlors&rsquo; pain was compounded by media reports and no family should ever have to endure that. I will not comment further on that but it was tragic for the family.</P>
    <P>Since Liam&rsquo;s death, I have met many constituents, all of whom referred to the media reports because they were shocked and abhorred by them. However, a significant number of them told stories about work Liam did for them. In the 1980s social welfare benefits and supports were not as good as they are now &mdash; it was a different era. Many constituents in socially deprived areas still appreciate and recognise personal and political acts involving Liam who assisted people through his kindness and generosity. Those people will never meet Hazel and talk to her about these acts but it has been interesting to meet people in my constituency office who still recognise and appreciate individual acts done by Liam on their behalf. May he rest in peace.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my sympathy to Hazel, the boys, Ciara, Noel and other members of Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s family. Were it not for the dignity shown by the family in recent weeks, I would be tempted to use the D&aacute;il privilege I am honoured to have to lambast every member of the media who so scurrilously and parasitically wrote about Liam Lawlor in the wake of his tragic death. However, given the dignity shown by the family, I will not get into that. I say this from the heart and not for the sake of political one-upmanship, although the apologies given by the media were so mealy-mouthed as to be worthless. When I read the newspapers the day after Liam&rsquo;s death, I was totally outraged, like everyone else. As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in said, even if the reports were true, there is such a thing as dignity and compassion. As someone who trained in Rathmines as a journalist, I was appalled and outraged and I hope we never witness the likes of it again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte and others stated one should never speak ill of the dead, but I disagree. If someone deserves abuse when he or she is alive, he or she deserves it when he or she is dead but former Deputy Lawlor did not deserve abuse when he was alive and he certainly does not deserve it following his death. Based on my experience working on the ground in Lucan, he had a fantastic reputation for working on behalf of his constituents. Whatever our disagreements about planning issues, which related not only to him but to the entire Fianna F&aacute;il ethos during the 1980s, they were not personal. I was unlucky in <Col N="1522"/>that I entered the House only following Liam&rsquo;s retirement. However, I have no doubt if Liam was on the Government benches and we had an argument in the House with the usual fireworks, immediately afterwards we would sit down to have a cup of tea or coffee and be friends.</P>
    <P>I did not get the opportunity to get to know him politically because I was only starting out, but I knew of him for many years, initially as a young child living in Lucan where one could not help but notice the name of Liam Lawlor because, as the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said, he was an avid constituency politician who made sure his constituents were aware of the work he was doing. Most importantly, however, he did the work, and that inspired my involvement in politics. Rather than saying, &ldquo;Vote for me, I am Green, I am principled&rdquo;, it is a case of saying &ldquo;Vote for me because I am doing my best to work for you&rdquo; and I was inspired by Liam Lawlor in that regard.</P>
    <P>I came across Liam on several occasions and what made him stand out from many Lucan-based politicians, present and past, was if he wanted to say something, he had the guts to say it, even if it was unpopular and he was at a public meeting where 90% of the attendance disagreed with him. Many politicians, in the Houses and on local authorities, do not have the courage of their convictions or the guts, and they could learn a great deal from Liam. He did not keep things personal.</P>
    <P>I was asked to write a piece on Liam for a local newspaper recently and I presume Hazel and the family have read it, but I illustrated Liam&rsquo;s kindness and courtesy. A number of years ago, the Adamstown development, a proposal for a town in south Lucan the size of Drogheda, was an issue. Valerie Cox of RTE travelled around the area with me to examine the development. We drove along and I mentioned we were about to pass Liam Lawlor&rsquo;s house. She swung off the road and drove up the driveway to the house, which took me totally by surprise. Out came the dog followed by Liam. I was sitting in the jeep looking at Valerie Cox and I asked her what she wanted me to do. She told me to go out to him because I knew him. I apologised to him saying I had been landed in this because Valerie Cox was doing a report on Adamstown. Liam had not done an interview for six months but he brought us out to the garden and gave us tea and biscuits. He extended his courtesy to us for at least an hour. Hazel arrived later and she was probably scratching her head wondering what the hell I was doing there with Valerie Cox.</P>
    <P>However, Liam gave her an interview and showed us around the house pointing out various personal items. That is testament to his human nature, courtesy and hospitality. He was a true gentleman. He did not have to do that as he could have just paid her the courtesy of an interview without doing anything else.</P><Col N="1523"/>
    <P>However, that was my first experience of Liam Lawlor, the gentleman, other than when he asked after me at the GAA club, of which my father was chairman, on a number of occasions. I was a footballer and Liam was interested in GAA games. He used to ask my father how I was and how my political career was going. He predicted I would be elected. Liam&rsquo;s personality was highlighted in the eulogy at his funeral service. If it were ever possible for that to be read into the D&aacute;il record, it should be, because it gave some real, human examples of Liam as a person, which the media never wanted to cover. They always wanted to look at the scandal and make accusations, and when the libel laws could not come into play following Liam&rsquo;s tragic and untimely death, they went all out for him. That was a travesty.</P>
    <P>I am not being mealy-mouthed in my praise, nor superficial. I am being genuine. My constituency, including the area of Lucan where Liam Lawlor lived for many years, was very well served by him. We will be lucky to see a public representative ever again working so hard on behalf of his constituents as Liam Lawlor. From the heart, I once again express my sympathy to his family.</P>

	<P>Like the Taoiseach last week, on Saturday I and others had the opportunity of meeting with members of the DUP and the issue of promised legislation arose in regard to the register of persons considered unsafe to work with children. I have asked the Taoiseach about this previously. He told me in October that the Department of Health and Children was discussing the establishment of a pre-employment consultancy service. Will the Taoiseach go beyond that and give the House a date because it does not make sense that the Assembly is what is holding it up?</P>

   <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My second point concerns the road safety authority about which I asked yesterday. I have since looked at reports in the newspapers where the Minister for Transport has said legislation will be required for the setting up of a road safety authority and that it will be brought in before Christmas. Are we operating a secret list of promised legislation or is that false? Has the media got it wrong again or has the Minister got it wrong?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow the Taoiseach to reply to the question. We cannot have a debate.</P>

	<P>Can we get to the truth?</P>

	<P>On the issue of the road safety authority, I gave the information yesterday on the only Bill I had listed. I suggest Deputy Sargent table a question to the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and pursue it in that way.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the register of persons who are considered unsafe to work with children, what the Deputy has said is correct. Initially we required the Assembly in the North to be operational but we have been in discussions to see whether we can establish a pre-employment consultancy service some other way.

What are the implications for Ireland of our failure to implement EU Directive 2002/90/91/EEC on the energy performance of buildings? We are building far more than any other country at present and there are serious implications down the road. I know the Taoiseach does not have the information now but, perhaps, he would find out the reason for the extraordinary delay in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

   <Title>European Union: Statements.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the House on the current situation in the European Union. As we come to the end of the year, it is timely to look back and reflect on the main events in Europe and their implications for the future. Without doubt, the referendum results on the European constitution in France and the Netherlands were a wake-up call for all Europeans. We cannot deny that the rejection of the European constitution in two of the founding members of the European Union was a severe blow. However, the referendum results also serve as a spur to drive forward debate on Europe in all member states. We have an opportunity to have a good, serious and factual debate about what Europe has done for us, what we have contributed to the Union and where the Union is going in the future.</P>
    <P>The European Council took advantage of this opportunity when it initiated a process of reflection and debate in all the member states at its meeting in June. For our part, the Government is committed to ensuring that our national debate is open and inclusive. The National Forum on Europe is playing a key role in taking it forward and is facilitating contributions from all sectors of society. The Government has published the White Paper on the European constitution to help inform the debate. The Department of the Taoiseach has produced a user-friendly report on Ireland&rsquo;s goals and objectives in the Union. Both the White Paper and this report have been circulated as widely as possible. In addition, the Department of the Taoiseach has today launched a new website which will make available key documents outlining the Government&rsquo;s position on Europe to aid the debate.</P>
    <P>The outcomes of the French and Dutch referendums undoubtedly suggest a level of disenchantment with the direction of the European Union. It may be that European citizens feel that the EU does not support them sufficiently in the issues they must face in their daily lives, such as unemployment, social justice, the fight against cross-border organised crime, terrorism and the challenge of integrating immigrants. Self-doubt and a lack of direction in the EU are bad for Europe and bad for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The benefits our EU membership has brought us are well known. Aside from the important direct financial benefits reflected in a net transfer of resources to Ireland of approximately &euro;35 billion, we also receive very significant indirect benefits. Since we joined the EU, our identity, national self-confidence and our sense of place in the world have been greatly strengthened. Membership of the European Union has also been the critical ingredient in breaking the cycle of poverty <Col N="1536"/>and emigration which held this country in its grip for more than a century. We are justifiably more confident and more optimistic than at any time since the foundation of the State. Our European Union membership has played a vital role in this transformation and we must not take this for granted. We need to continue to work hard to promote and protect our national interests in the EU and, equally importantly, work for the success of the Union as a whole.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to punch above its weight in Europe. In recent weeks one Irish citizen, Catherine Day, succeeded another, David O&rsquo;Sullivan, in the top post in the European Commission. Also during the year, the Government succeeded in securing official and working status for the Irish language in the EU. While its continual success is a core national priority, I do not want to play down the very real fears that many people in the European Union have, including people in Ireland. People fear a loss of jobs to low cost countries and a race to the bottom in social standards. They are struggling to come to terms with immigration. Many citizens are suspicious of economic reform when it seems to bring only pain and very little evidence of any gain.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>However, we must recognise that the world outside the Union is changing rapidly. When the economies of China, India and the other emerging economies were putting in place the policies and investments necessary to harness globalisation to the development of their national economies, Europe&rsquo;s focus was inwards. We struggled to cope with the aftermath of the collapse of communism, the fall of the Iron Curtain and the reunification of Europe after decades of division. We worked to ensure the institutions and the common policies of the greatly enlarged European Union were strong enough to protect and promote the interests of all its people. We need to make Europe work, but we cannot do this in a vacuum. We also need to look out at a world that has changed dramatically over the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Last month, an informal meeting of European Union Heads of State or Government at Hampton Court discussed the challenges facing the Union. The European Commission submitted to the meeting a useful report, European Values in the Globalised World. It was sobering to be reminded that there are now 19 million people unemployed in the Union, that over the coming decades, Europe will change from having four people of working age for every elderly citizen in 2004 to a ratio of 2:1, that Indian universities are turning out more than a quarter of a million engineers every year and that research spending in China is set to catch up with that in the European Union by 2010. Twenty years ago, just 10% of manufactured goods came from developing and emerging countries, but within 15 years China&rsquo;s and India&rsquo;s shares alone could be as high <Col N="1537"/>as 50%. In 2004, China&rsquo;s share of global merchandise trade surpassed that of Japan.</P>
    <P>The meeting at Hampton Court showed the willingness of the European Union Heads of State or Government to work together to deal with these challenges. While many of the levers of economic reform are in the hands of national governments, there remains much that we can do together in Europe to support our national efforts. At Hampton Court, I emphasised the need to take the bigger picture into account when we are developing and implementing EU policies. A particular example is state aids. Too often we behave as if competition between the member states is on the same level as the competitive challenge we face from China and India. We must take broad economic considerations, particularly the challenge of globalisation, into account in all areas of EU decision-making.</P>
    <P>I welcome Prime Minister Blair&rsquo;s encouragement to Europe&rsquo;s leaders to confront the challenges we face. However, if we are to equip a Union of 25 or more member states to deal with those challenges, we will inevitably return to the European constitution. Some 13 countries containing a majority of the Union&rsquo;s citizens have ratified the constitution, including two in national referendums. Given the current situation in the European Union and the fact that we are engaged in a period of debate and reflection, I do not see a national referendum on the European constitution being held in the lifetime of the current D&aacute;il. Nevertheless, while the ratification process may be suspended and the future is uncertain, I cannot see the European constitution going away indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The setback in the ratification process for the European constitution does not mean that business in Europe has come to a halt. The reality is quite the contrary. Two issues that will be the focus of our attention in the coming weeks will be the negotiations on the future financial perspectives and the Doha development round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.</P>
    <P>The failure of the June European Council to reach political agreement on the financial framework for the period 2007-13 reflects the current state of uncertainty. On future financial perspectives, it is very important that we reach a deal at the European Council in December. Europe badly needs some successes. We need to show our people that the Europe of 25 can take the key decisions affecting the future of the Continent. We came very close to agreement in June. It will be important to retain as much as we can of the good work done during the Luxembourg Presidency as we work for agreement next month.</P>
    <P>The October 2002 agreement on CAP funding is a central element of the European Union&rsquo;s financial perspectives. Agriculture is one of the most sensitive issues in the WTO&rsquo;s Doha development round of trade negotiations. The far-reaching CAP reforms agreed by the Union in 2002 and <Col N="1538"/>2003 were a major contribution to the Doha development round of trade talks. The Government is strongly in favour of a successful and balanced outcome to the Doha round. We know these negotiations are important for the future development of our economy and hold great promise for the integration of poor countries into the global economy.</P>
    <P>I mentioned some of the challenges facing the Europe of the 21st century, challenges that can only be addressed by states working together. This in itself poses another challenge, that of making enlargement work and continuing the enlargement process. The ten new member states which joined on 1 May 2004 are adapting rapidly to the Union and are making an important contribution to its work. The European constitution provides that membership of the Union is open to all European states which respect its core values. It is on this basis that the ten new member states joined the Union. Similarly, we look forward to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia and Turkey. The opening of negotiations with Croatia shows that the European Union is determined to support peace-building and reconstruction in the western Balkans. The perspective of EU membership for these countries will help underpin political stability in the region and the need to rebuild their economies after the vicious Balkan wars. The opening of accession negotiations with Turkey is a welcome step forward in the already close relations between the Union and this important and influential neighbour. The negotiations are likely to be long and difficult, and their outcome, as in any negotiation, cannot be determined in advance. However, the objective on both sides is membership.</P>
    <P>The European Union is at a critical juncture in its development. We must meet the immediate challenges of achieving agreement on the financial perspectives and the WTO Doha development round. We must also look to the longer term. While the outcomes of the constitutional referendums may have cast light on the concerns of the citizens of Europe, they also brought into focus the wide degree of agreement on what Europe needs to do to meet these concerns.</P>
    <P>Europe is already deepening co-operation between the member states in the fight against international crime, terrorism, illegal immigration and trafficking in people and drugs. The Hague programme, which the European Council adopted a year ago, provides the basis for much of our common effort in this area. In this age of globalisation, when goods, services, information and communications flow relatively unrestricted across our borders, we must work together to prevent international criminal syndicates, drug traffickers and others from exploiting our more open world for their own criminal ends. The role of the European Union in breaking up international criminal gangs, preventing terrorist <Col N="1539"/>attacks and securing our borders against people traffickers and illegal immigration is not well understood or appreciated by many people. However, it is critical to the security and functioning of our communities. It is an area where significant improvements in co-operation between member states have been introduced and where we will see more progress in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The creation of the Internal Market has been of immense benefit to the people of Europe. Work on the Internal Market remains important as we seek to remove unnecessary barriers to growth. We, together with the UK and Sweden, have granted free movement to workers from the ten new member states. This has been a positive experience for us. The new workers are making an important contribution to our economy and our society. I look forward to the other member states, which have not yet opened up their labour markets to the ten, adopting a similar approach.</P>
    <P>We also need to push forward the EU&rsquo;s legislative agenda on the Internal Market. The draft directive on services has attracted much controversy, reflected in the huge number of amendments the directive has attracted in the European Parliament. The vigorous discussion in the Parliament of this important directive shows that the concerns about its implications, particularly from workers, are being taken into account in the EU&rsquo;s legislative process. The principle of a free market in services is one that we have long supported and will continue to support. With 70% of the modern economy devoted to services, it is essential that we create a real European market in services. However, it is the Government&rsquo;s view that there must be adequate safeguards to ensure that the services directive does not result in a race to the bottom in terms of labour and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>Europe needs to do more in the world. It is already the world&rsquo;s largest donor of development assistance and plays a key role in promoting peace in regions of instability and political turmoil. It leads international efforts to support the reforms of the United Nations proposed by Kofi Annan. However, it needs to expand and deepen its engagement with the world in the years to come on the basis of our common values. It must promote its commitment to effective multilateral institutions and its solidarity with the poorest people in the poorest countries.</P>
    <P>Our fellow European citizens in each of the member states are now holding similar debates on Europe. I am confident that our collective thoughts and ideas will provide direction to the Austrian Presidency in the first half of 2006 on how the Union of 25 should advance to ensure that the expectations of all its citizens are fulfilled.</P>
    <P>When I report to the European Council next year on the outcome of our national debate, I want to say that there is a deep-rooted commit<Col N="1540"/>ment in Ireland, a commitment that is shared by almost every party in this House, to Europe&rsquo;s values, to the success of the European Union and to the continuing construction of a Europe that reflects the needs of our people. As we face a rapidly changing world, I am more than ever convinced that our EU membership is fundamental to our continuing economic and social success and to the future of our young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have frequently stated, Fine Gael is a strong supporter of the proposed constitution for the European Union. The proposed constitution simplifies the operations of the EU institutions and the decision making processes within which the Union functions. It incorporates a charter of fundamental rights for all citizens and gives national parliaments a new role in the scrutiny of decisions at European level. The document is good for Ireland and good for Europe. It has been decided that we should have an EU-wide period of reflection following the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands, which have made it impossible for the proposed constitution to be ratified by all 25 member states within the timeframe originally envisaged. It should be borne in mind that reflection only gets us so far, however.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union has profoundly benefited our people in economic and social terms. Irish people have the right to travel, work, study and reside in other EU member states. The EU has challenged endemic inequalities in our legislation and in how we do things here. It has championed the case for environmental protection. Irish companies enjoy substantial economic benefits as a result of this country&rsquo;s membership of the EU because they can trade freely with 24 other European countries, thereby accessing a potential market of close to 500 million people. The EU is the largest political, economic and social bloc in the world. People recognise that there have been real and tangible improvements in their quality of life in the three decades since Ireland became a member of the EU. Recent research undertaken by the European Commission showed that Irish people are discerning and can recognise a good thing when they see it. Nine out of every ten Irish people feel Ireland has benefited from EU membership. Three quarters of the population believe that EU membership is a good thing.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned these statistics to put another important statistic in context. I refer to the European Commission&rsquo;s finding that half of all people in Ireland have no opinion on the proposed European Union constitution. We need to consider, in light of that statistic, what is at the root of the fundamental disconnect between the EU and the proposed EU constitution. If 90% of people believe that Ireland has benefited from EU membership, why do many of them have no opinion on the proposed constitution, which is an important document? It is clear that more than <Col N="1541"/>reflection is needed in respect of the proposed constitution &mdash; something constructive has to come from this period to address the gulf between EU citizens and the proposed constitution. I recently read an opinion piece on this issue written by a representative of the Institute of International Affairs in Rome. The writer argued that the EU&rsquo;s failure to put forward a credible argument for why the proposed constitution is needed is at the heart of the current difficulties.</P>
    <P>The European Union needs direction and clarity of purpose and aim. It needs to engage in a two-way process of communication with citizens. Not only should it listen to the real concerns of its citizens about the EU, but it should explain the Union&rsquo;s role and responsibilities. The European Commission should make a strong and concerted effort to inform the public of its role, to explain how it operates and to send officials to public meetings in member states to speak on issues of importance and concern to citizens of the EU. Such an effort to strengthen the Union&rsquo;s democratic engagement with its citizens would be warmly welcomed in all member states. The national Governments of EU member states need to engage openly and honestly with their electorates about developments at EU level. Rather than approaching issues half-heartedly, we need to interact fully with the EU in many areas. The National Forum on Europe, which is examining its role in the context of the current period of reflection, must come out from behind the castle walls and go to the people to listen to their views. There is little point in hiring hotels and inviting people to listen to speeches. A more dynamic form of interaction, which allows for real debate and a real exchange of views, must be prioritised. I am not just saying that here &mdash; I have said it at meetings of the forum&rsquo;s steering committee. It is too often the case that the forum&rsquo;s activities are remote from the people. We need to break down the psychological barrier that has been put in place as a consequence of the decision to pursue the forum&rsquo;s activities behind the castle&rsquo;s walls.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the issues of concern to people in Ireland today. Having listened to such people in recent years, I know that many of them are worried about the possible loss of jobs to the new accession states and the instability it will cause. They have observed the drift of jobs from their own areas to the eastern parts of the European Union, which is having a negative effect on their opinions of the EU and the process of enlargement. Many people concerned about the pace of EU enlargement believe it may be appropriate, now that the Union has expanded to 25 member states, to take time to assess the effect of enlargement on present structures. They also believe there are question marks over the ability of the EU to absorb further member states. The next EU enlargement may take place in just over a year, when it is scheduled that Bulgaria and Romania will join the Union. Accession talks are <Col N="1542"/>in progress with Croatia and Turkey. The opening of talks with Croatia has raised expectations across the Balkan region about future EU membership. Ukraine and Georgia will also seek EU membership at some future time. Such countries may have a valid political argument in favour of their membership of the Union, but I remind the House that many people are worried that too rapid an expansion will weaken the EU. Rapid EU enlargement may be part of the agenda of some member states which do not wish to see a strong and vibrant EU. Such countries believe that rapid enlargement will lead to the weakening of the EU as an economic unit. It is certain that the United States subscribes to this concept.</P>
    <P>The riots in French cities and towns in recent weeks have struck a chord with many people in Ireland who equate the riots with immigration problems. They wrongly link such problems with the possible accession of Turkey to the European Union. Having had the privilege of visiting Ankara and Istanbul in recent times, I am convinced that Turkey can play a vital role in the EU at a future stage. As the political process is not always in tune with the thought process of the electorate, however, we must enter into a strong dialogue with the electorate. We should listen to the opinions and fears of the people, rather than lecturing them on how wonderful the EU is. If we are to address the electorate&rsquo;s concerns, we should put forward our view of the EU and Ireland&rsquo;s place within it. We should articulate what Ireland wants from the Lisbon Agenda and how it will get it. We need to explain why enlargement is a good thing and outline the opportunities it has brought to Ireland. We should explain why police and judicial co-operation, for example, is important for all EU citizens. We need to show that the EU has a role on the international stage and a responsibility that runs in tandem with that. Fine Gael has clearly stated its position on EU developments in security and defence. It has put on the record its ideas on how the EU and Ireland should move forward in this regard. While there can be no doubt about Fine Gael&rsquo;s position, the approach of the Government in making policy decisions in this important area by stealth serves to build the electorate&rsquo;s suspicion and resentment of the European Union. The people want open and honest debate on this and other EU issues. We have to call things as we see them.</P>
    <P>The last time he spoke on European Union matters in the House, the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, was deeply critical of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s attempts to link a new deal on the UK rebate with a further scaling back of the Common Agricultural Policy. This deadlock has continued in recent days, as the UK Presidency has continued to try to link any deal on the UK rebate with farm subsidy concessions. The Common Agricultural Policy has undergone radical reform over the past 15 years. Spending on agriculture as a proportion of the EU budget has fallen over <Col N="1543"/>that time. Any further modifications must be a matter of negotiation, rather than unilateral attack from any single member state. By linking reform on one single issue to the wider question of agricultural subsidy, the UK Presidency has undermined European relationships and may pass this problem on to the next Presidency of the EU in 2006.</P>
    <P>Today, many eyes are focused on the role of the EU at the World Trade Organisation. I am concerned, however, that the European Commission has made too many concessions, which would have a negative effect on farmers&rsquo; livelihoods, the rural community and rural economy. The revised European Commission proposal put forward at the end of last month proposes a 70% cut in domestic supports, including funding for intervention, along with the complete phasing out of export refunds over a seven to ten year period. In addition, the Commission has also put forward proposals to reduce tariffs on food imports by between 30% and 60%. Specifically the Commission has tabled a 50% cut on imports of milk products and a 60% cut on imports of beef.</P>
    <P>However, the return proposal from the United States is of little value. Its planned cuts in supports for agriculture, to be introduced in the 2007 US Farm Bill, are unlikely to take place. In reality, will the US Congress accept cuts in US farm subsidies on the eve of an election in the United States?</P>

	<P>What does the Deputy think?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe it will happen.</P>
    <P>The EU Agriculture Commissioner should be a driving force in these talks. During the last round of WTO talks, the former Agriculture Commissioner, Franz Fischler, took a prominent role but current Commissioner Fischer Boel is not leading this debate. The Agriculture Commissioner must be given a more significant role in these negotiations in order to protect the viability of Irish family farms.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to concerns about the Iranian nuclear programme. The recent comments by the President of Iran relating to Israel were unacceptable, and I have deep concerns for the welfare of the former ambassador to Ireland from Iran, currently in custody in that country. The European Union may be ready to resume talks with Iran on this issue in early December, which were stalled in August when Iran commenced uranium conversion processes. I understand that Russia has proposed a deal which could see Iran entering into a joint venture with it which would allow Iran to use uranium for power generation but would ensure that uranium enrichment, the precursor to the production of weapons-grade material, would take place in Russia. The growth in nuclear sabre-rattling must be of concern to all of us within the European Union and in the wider world. The development of Iranian nuclear capa<Col N="1544"/>bilities would do nothing for the stability of the Middle East, especially in light of the recent comments from the Iranian President.</P>
    <P>I point out to the Minister, as I have at committee meetings, that allowing the UK, Britain and France to be the voice of Europe in negotiations with Iran needs to be reviewed because of the track record of one or two of those countries. The double standards involved in the approach to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty also needs to be addressed. I ask the Minister to give his view on the capability of the UK, France and Germany to reach an accommodation with Iran on what is currently one of the dominant issues on the international stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there is a sos at 1.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I suggest the defeat of the treaty in France and The Netherlands is a serious setback for the constitutional treaty but it is not the first setback the European project has endured or experienced. On all previous occasions if the idea had merit and the proposals had positive content, they were implemented and agreed on a new horizon and in a different timeframe when a sufficient number of people could be persuaded to endorse them. Therefore, the period of reflection should be combined in two contexts. The first is to examine what we can do between now and 1 November 2007 and to examine the probability that the French and the Dutch, if their current political leaderships are to be taken at face value, will not put forward the same question on the same treaty to their people in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I have a few suggestions to make to the two Ministers and the Minister of State present, and they follow from the comments of my colleague, Deputy Allen, which I warmly support. The leadership of the European Union must be restored to the Commission. The President of the Commission must receive the encouragement and the support of all member states. In the past, particularly when Jacques Delors was the President, that support tended to come from the large dominant member states in a European Union of 12 and subsequently a Union of 15. The numerical composition of a European Union of 25 does not provide for the same kind of relationship to exist for a host of reasons, but there is a possibility of achieving that, and Ireland has a unique capability of having a leadership role in this regard. I say that in all sincerity and admiration for the achievements of the current Administration in terms of the friends of the community method and the group of 27 that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy&rsquo;s predecessor, the Minister, <Col N="1545"/>Deputy Roche, succeeded in using in the run-up to his outstandingly successful achievement during the Irish Presidency in securing agreement on ratification by the 25 member states. I have said it previously and I am happy to say again that we must find a new way of instilling in President Barroso and his colleagues a sense of self-confidence, in the first instance, and of encouragement to bring forward proposals that will enable us get to the far side of Laeken and Nice that was set out and declared when those decisions were taken.</P>
    <P>I will give a few examples of that, and I am on record as having said this to President Barroso in the Mansion House when we met last June. There are elements in the draft constitutional treaty, and I am subject to correction on this, that could be implemented by common agreement of the 25 member states. They address the concern about lack of openness and transparency in the decision-making process of the Council of Ministers when it meets as a legislature. I am not aware, and perhaps the Minister and the Minister of State present and their Department of Foreign Affairs personnel could advise me to the contrary, of any legal impediment that would prevent the Council of Ministers, when meeting in Council on legislative matters, from so doing in public. If that step was to be taken by agreement, it would probably require unanimity of the current members. However, since we have got agreement from those members on the draft treaty, such a proposal &mdash; to do in public what they do in private &mdash; could hardly be against the interests of the citizens of member states.</P>
    <P>I suggest, for example, that there is a need for a stronger connection between the national parliaments and the European Union, and I will go into that in some detail when we resume after the sos. In essence, the unique hybrid that is the construction of the European Union, which is a combination of intergovernmentalism on the one hand and federalism on the other, does not carry through into the decision-making process of the Union as it currently exists. The decision-making process of the Commission proposing and the Council and the Parliament, now with a more equal relationship between the two, together deciding on what will become draft European laws and subsequently European laws, is uniquely a federal construct. It has none of the intergovernmentalism associated with decision-making in justice and home affairs matters or in respect of common foreign and security policy. Part of the political difficulty is that it is very difficult for the ordinary European citizen at national level to see the operation of political decision-making at a European level. That is not the fault of the MEPs in all our parties in their political groups in the Parliament or the fault of the Ministers who participate in decision-making, but we have to find a new way to bring the national parliaments closer to the decision-making process of the European project and to bring the decision-<Col N="1546"/>making process of Europe closer to politicians in this House and in every other national assembly of the member states.</P>
    <P>I have a detailed set of proposals which were unanimously agreed by all my party colleagues at the Joint Committee on European Affairs some weeks ago. The suggestion is that in each of the three plenary sessions in all the member states there will be a dedicated European week in the national parliament. When the debate resumes I will outline how that would function. Effectively, we would close down national business in this House and concentrate on all those issues of European concern and interest to our members and our electorates.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    <P>The questions asked by the Deputies arise in the immediate aftermath of the brutal killing of two people in Firhouse and the equally callous killing of another man in Clontarf in the past two weeks. Both these incidents are being fully investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I am sure the House will appreciate that I have to be careful about revealing specific details of the incidents <Col N="1547"/>and the intensive investigations that are ongoing in order not to prejudice future prosecutions. I can say, however, that all the indications are that these killings formed part of a vicious feud between two groups who are struggling to control drug distribution in areas of Dublin. The harsh reality is that these people deal in death and will kill to protect their patch and to recover their debts. However, we have to be clear that murder is unacceptable and, regardless of motive, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is determined to do all in its power to bring the perpetrators of these and other similar offences to justice.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murders recorded to date in 2005 in which firearms were used is 19. While the term &ldquo;gangland killings&rdquo; tends to be widely used in the media in referring to the nature of certain unlawful killings, this does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na classifies crime or particular offences.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. I am very pleased the Government has approved my proposals for the funding of a 14-point anti-crime programme during 2006. A record &euro;1,290 million is being provided to underpin the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This represents an increase of &euro;146 million or 13% when compared to 2005, or an increase of 115% when compared to the 1997 provision of &euro;600 million. This increased funding will provide, <i>inter alia, </i>for additional Garda overtime, the continuation and extension of Operation Anvil, which is focused on the prevention of serious crime and which has already proven to be successful, and the purchase of a fleet of specially adapted high visibility and high powered Garda vehicles.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that in October 2004 the Government approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to a record 14,000 in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. The ongoing recruitment campaign will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006, 13 months from now.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na employs a range of techniques in the fight against serious crime. The national bureau of criminal investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime and it carries out this role by conducting intelligence driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units, specifically, the national criminal intelligence unit, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, as a specific response some months ago to the problem of gun crime in Dublin, the Government decided to provide funding for Operation Anvil. This operation was undertaken, not as the sole response to <Col N="1548"/>this problem, but as a targeted response to augment the work which the Garda was doing day in and day out to address this problem. This intelligence-led policing initiative targets active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling, static checkpoints, uniformed mobile and foot patrols supported by armed plain clothes patrols and covert operations.</P>
    <P>Operation Anvil has led to a number of very positive outcomes to date. It has led, for example, to seven arrests for murder, 221 arrests for serious assault and the seizure of 210 firearms. I agreed with the Garda Commissioner in the context of the additional budgetary provision, to which I have alluded, to the continuation of Operation Anvil and to its geographical extension.</P>
 
  <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keeps under review its response to emerging developments and I assure the House that I have been in constant contact with the Garda Commissioner in regard to this matter. In this context, the House will be aware that last week the Garda Commissioner announced he has arranged for the allocation of an additional 50 officers to the national bureau of criminal investigation to a unit to be headed by a detective chief superintendent to augment the effort to target groups involved in organised crime in the Dublin metropolitan region. The unit will, of course, work closely with the garda&iacute; deployed on Operation Anvil and with other specialist units. I am sure the House will welcome this development and continue to support the efforts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the challenges it faces.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that our legislative package for tackling serious and organised crime is one of the toughest in Europe. The Government has been and remains determined to give the Garda the legislative resources necessary to do its job, not least in the Criminal Justice Bill which is before the House and which will significantly assist the Garda, particularly in the area of gun crime.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Government has approved my proposals for further amendments to the Bill, to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for criminal offences in regard to participation in organised crime, to strengthen existing provisions relating to the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking and to amend the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review. I am confident these measures will lead to an improvement in the situation in the fight against crime in general and in particular the fight against gangland and organised crime.</P>
  </Speaker><Col N="1549"/>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The first and most serious question that arises is whether the Minister accepts we have a major problem with gangland crime. Everything else flows from that. We have a very serious problem and all the figures point to that. There were 75 murders with guns between 1998 and 2004. Of those 75 murders only 53 convictions have been secured. That indicates a very serious problem. Things are even worse if one compares the fact that in 1998 there were only four murders with guns and the figure went up to 20 in 2003. As the Minister stated, there have been 19 murders with guns already this year. Does he accept that measures are necessary at two ends, one from the point of view of the Garda?</P>
    <P>I am glad a suggestion I have made a number of times about having a gangland crime unit has been taken on board. That will be a help. The Minister&rsquo;s hands are tied to a degree because regardless of the statistical gymnastics that goes on, the garda&iacute; simply are not there. According to a reply to a question last week, there are 12,309 garda&iacute;. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated last week that there will not be 14,000 garda&iacute; until 2008. That will not solve the current problem in Firhouse, Clontarf and elsewhere. Can anything further be done with the resources that are available at present?</P>
    <P>Second, the proposed Criminal Justice Bill is trundling on with a series of add-ons. It is a long-playing record at this stage. It was circulated a year and a half ago and we have had several announcements of new additions to it. I am interested in one provision, making membership of an armed gang a criminal offence. Could that be abstracted out and put through the D&aacute;il straight away? I can guarantee the support of Fine Gael for such a proposal. With the low rate of convictions it is clear that many of the people committing these murders are still on the streets but if the necessary proof were there to secure a conviction under the provision to which I referred, these people could be taken out of circulation.</P>
    <P>I suggest very strongly to the Minister that, rather than having this saga of the Criminal Justice Bill continue, we put in place this provision and start taking these people off the streets on the basis of offences for which they can be convicted? We have not even had the Minister&rsquo;s amendments yet. The Bill has already rolled on for a year and a half and even with the best of co-operation from the Opposition it will not be law for some time to come.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, I believe it is a serious problem. I do not minimise the threat from this violence between these gang members on each other because, inevitably, if it continues somebody other than the intended victims of shootings will become involved. On the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that we should break out provisions of the Crimi<Col N="1550"/>nal Justice Bill and move with them separately, all of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Bill without exception are important, such as the power to preserve scenes and extend the detention of people. It is not a matter of bringing forward one or two key sections. In any event, as the Deputy well knows, those sections cannot operate with retrospective effect. Criminal law only operates prospectively.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned Garda numbers. I will reiterate for the Deputy&rsquo;s benefit that the numbers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are increasing and will reach 14,000 by December 2006.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>About time. That was the commitment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>A good deal of scepticism was expressed on this. The numbers are increasing. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, referred to the number of people who will have completed their two-year training by 2008.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I also make clear to the Deputies opposite that the number of garda&iacute; fell when their parties were last in office. This point must be made constantly because some people are prepared to talk about what I am doing as if it is not enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>They did not keep their promise and the Minister knows it. He should deal with the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy keeps contradicting me on this, I will stick out this argument because the record shows that I am telling the truth and he is bluffing and blustering as always.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may want to be disruptive but the facts are that the numbers in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have increased from 10,800 when the Deputy&rsquo;s party left office, and it had fallen at that stage from when his party had taken office, to more than 12,300 now and it will be 14,000 in December 2006, which is 13 months away.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should tell his colleague about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to get in.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not make and break promises like the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is difficult to get in when the Minister is in full flight. He asked us to consider his track record. We will certainly do that. The 2,000 garda&iacute; have not arrived and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, who holds the purse strings, stated they will not arrive until 2008.</P>
    <P>We will consider the Minister&rsquo;s track record on gangland killings, which is the focus of this question. Only 12 months ago, the Minister delivered the famous line that it was the dying sting of the wasp. We have had a threefold increase in killings in the past 12 months. Obviously there is no track record there. We are getting worse rather than improving.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept that all this crime is fuelled by the fact that drugs are rampant and rife throughout the country because vast profits can be made, and feuding parties exist to defend patches because they are so valuable? We have young millionaires prepared to pay any price to <Col N="1552"/>ensure their line of supply is maintained. That is what is happening. It is a simple problem and the Minister has not recognised it yet. The people in question must be put out of business. They have increased threefold the number of killings they commit.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House what level of resources this new unit of 50 garda&iacute; will have, given the Garda Commissioner stated it takes 5.2 garda&iacute; to do a 24-hour shift? How many gangs will it be able to put under surveillance? How will the Minister ensure the conviction rate increases from 12% to the 85% rate for the same type of crime in Los Angeles, California? This is a crime that can be dealt with. It is the Minister who is not dealing with it.</P>
    <P>What the Minister produced yesterday is a relaunch and reheating of proposals he launched five or six times already during the past 18 months to two years. We want action. Will the Minister convince the House that he means business this time, that he is not merely paying lip-service, talking or articulating because it sounds good, and that he will deliver for the first time on these critical issues?</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

	<P>That is not the answer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to consider the record of this Government in the fight against crime, especially during my tenure as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been more heavily resourced than it is now. The process of reorganising the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well advanced and will be implemented in the first six months of next year. This process of radical reformation of the force and the introduction of new management structures was postponed by successive Administrations in this House. The Labour Party promised twice it would re-constitute the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It held office for ten years and did nothing about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party never held the Ministry with responsibility for justice.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked one question and it is a serious issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We have now spent ten minutes on this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The rest of the time was allowed to the Minister. May I be permitted to ask one further supplementary question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A very brief question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Contrary to what the Minister stated on numbers, in his speech on the Estimates, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, confirmed that the Garda figure at the end of 2006 will be less than 13,000 and that the figure of 14,000 cannot be reached in the lifetime of this Government and will not be reached until 2008. In that situation, and I ask the Minister to get real, can better support be provided for the limited number of garda&iacute; we have in terms of replacing their 20 year old walkie talkies, providing them with individual anti-stab vests and other better equipment?</P>
    <P>I take the point about all the 25 or 40 important issues that now emerge from the Criminal Justice Bill. Will the Minister give serious consideration to expediting the priority items and let us get that part of the Bill through? He will have full co-operation from the Opposition parties.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Costello may ask a brief question and the Minister will make a final brief reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not asked any supplementary questions so far. On a different issue from those raised so far, the question of telecommunications and secure communications for the Garda, we have been promised the digital Tetra <Col N="1554"/>system. We still operate on the analogue system. Proper surveillance cannot be mounted without a secure system. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have that. Many garda&iacute; still use their own mobile phones. It is a scandal that in this day and age the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not have the best in modern technology. Now that three and a half years have passed, the Minister may only have six months left in office. Will he convince us that before he leaves office he will provide proper telecommunications? I do not see anything in the Estimates to do that.</P>

     <Quest>if the appointment of <Col N="1555"/>designated community garda&iacute; in every Garda district will be approved with a view to combating the scourge of anti-social behaviour (details supplied).</Quest>
     <QRef>[35867/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Community policing has been, continues to be and will be fostered, developed and resourced within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Community policing is one of the core means by which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deliver its policing service. Because the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na depends on the community it serves, there is a strong organisational commitment to engaging with the community.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the deployment of resources including personnel, that the total number of personnel allocated to community policing duties on a full-time basis as of 21 June 2005, the latest date for which figures are available, was 459. Combating anti-social behaviour, whether through community policing or through the wider use of Garda resources, is an important objective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>As the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for 2005 acknowledges, it is a specific Government policing priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue to focus on crime prevention and reduction including, in co-operation with local authorities and interaction with local communities, the prevention of public order offences, with particular emphasis on those resulting from alcohol and substance misuse. In the achievement of these and other priorities, it is the responsibility of each divisional officer to assign personnel within his or her division to specific duties to ensure that the optimum use is made of all available resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, those resources will be at an all-time high but I will not repeat this in case I excite another bout of shouting. Resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have improved dramatically.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

	<P>One initiative increases the money allocated to youth diversion schemes, bringing the total available for these highly successful interventions to &euro;6.6 million. Some 60 of these schemes target youths at risk throughout the country. It is proposed to increase that figure to 100.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated that some 500 community garda&iacute; were in place as of 21 June 2005. In view of anti-social behaviour in urban and rural areas, is the Minister serious in stating the Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are taking this matter seriously? What does the all-time high, to which he refers, mean? There is not one <Col N="1556"/>dedicated community garda in the town of Clonmel or County Tipperary. There has been no increase in Garda numbers in Clonmel since the Minister came to office or since the previous Government came to office. In the town of Fethard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is supposed to seek information rather than provide it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is clearly in need of information. Is it acceptable that in a town the size of Clonmel, there is no dedicated community garda and no increase in garda numbers over the past ten years? In the case of Fethard is he satisfied Garda authorities have refused to replace one of three garda&iacute; who served the town in past years?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy had posed a question on Garda numbers in Clonmel I would be in a better position to respond in detail to the points made.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked that before.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Healy asked a general question on community policing and now we are discussing the number of garda&iacute; in Clonmel, which is a different question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing community policing, a matter the Minister has refused to address.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always happy to answer questions that are fairly put. I will answer the question on arrangements in his town if the Deputy writes to me. The Deputy seems to be radically confused about the concepts of community policing and public order policing. Two garda&iacute; on patrol on the main street of Clonmel on Saturday evening is not community policing. Community policing involves dedicated police officers with particular liaisons with local communities and carrying out community functions in those areas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what we seek and the Minister is refusing to provide it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Speaking on community policing and public order offences in a confused and abstracted way is a mistake.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>I said nothing on public order offences.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that anti-social behaviour of the order we see is the forerunner of gangsterism and of the type of murders seen over the past two or three weeks? Will the Minister do anything about this?

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Sections 18 and 20 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 make statutory provision on the justifiable use of force in order to protect a person or property or to prevent a crime. Section 18 sets out the various purposes for which justifiable force may be lawfully used, that does not constitute an offence. The force used must be reasonable by reference to the circumstances believed by the person to exist. The purposes include the protection of the person or his or her family or another person from injury, assault or detention caused by a criminal act, protection of his or her property or property belonging to another from appropriation, destruction or damage caused by a criminal act or from trespass or infringement and prevention of crime or a breach of the peace. Section 20 defines the meaning of &ldquo;use of force&rdquo; for the purposes of section 18 and section 20(4) provides that the fact that a person had an opportunity to retreat before using force shall be taken into account in conjunction with other relevant evidence, in determining whether the use of force was reasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 1(2) provides that for the purposes of section 18, it is immaterial whether a belief is justified or not, if it is honestly held. The presence or absence of reasonable grounds for the belief is <Col N="1558"/>a matter to which the court or jury is to have regard, in conjunction with any other relevant matters, in considering whether the person honestly held the belief.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe is aware, it is important that within the criminal justice system we strive to achieve a balance between the competing rights of all those involved. While we all wish to protect ourselves, our families and our property from potential danger, we must also be accountable for the actions we take in such a situation if they go further than is reasonable in the circumstances. The legislation clearly states that the use of force is justifiable in certain circumstances and also what is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; use of force. It also provides that a belief of the need to protect oneself does not have to be justified objectively if honestly held and leaves this as a matter for the courts to decide.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the law as it currently stands is sufficient and serves us well. However, if the Deputy has proposals for changes to the law in this area, I will examine them. I stress, however, that this is not an issue on which there should be issue-surfing. There is a delicate balance between the use of force by citizens and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their own purposes on the one hand and the protection of everybody in the community on the other. Nobody has spoken to me recently, or in the light of recent legal cases, of any reasonable grounds to change what is already set out in law as the correct balance between the right of self-defence, as it is commonly called, and the duty to uphold the rights of others, including not taking life unless strictly necessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the Minister&rsquo;s reply that he feels that the balance provided by the 1997 Act is the correct balance. The law needs to be rebalanced and the pendulum needs to be swung more in favour of the home owner who has to face an intruder, perhaps in very difficult circumstances. I am not referring to a recent major case but am talking about the general issue. There are approximately 25,000 burglaries per annum, two thirds of which involve intrusion into people&rsquo;s homes. The onus is on us to provide the home owner, in so far as we can, with the best possible protection.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the Minister&rsquo;s statement that the fact of a person having the opportunity to retreat before using force should be taken into account. That is a matter of major concern to home owners who might be faced with a very difficult situation at very short notice.</P>
    <P>Objective commentators such as Professor Finbar McAuley of UCD have referred to this issue and argued that the phraseology in the 1997 Act needs to be examined. In the United Kingdom, where there have been similar difficulties, moves are afoot to go much farther than even I would be prepared to go, that is, to put an <Col N="1559"/>onus on the prosecution to prove that the force used by a home owner was grossly disproportionate. Does the Minister believe there should be a greater onus on the prosecution to prove that the home owner was unreasonable, rather than the current situation, which leaves the matter somewhat up in the air, at least as far as a jury is concerned?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1997 legislation was introduced by former Deputy Owen and put through the Houses in the lead up to the general election of that year by the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left Government. The legislation predates the current Government. The wording and balance was chosen by the Opposition parties, not by me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister cannot improve on that wording.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe has stated that he believes the balance might be recast somewhat in favour of the home owner. Let us see the colour of his money on this issue. Let us see exactly how he believes that should be done. If he wishes to do this, the Criminal Justice Bill provides an opportunity for the House to consider the issue. If the balance that was struck in 1997 in the legislation introduced by former Deputy Owen is inadequate, improper or ill-advised in the light of modern circumstances, let us see the exact circumstance and changes that the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    <P>It is easy to speak about these matters and to assert that one would like to shift the pendulum a little to the left or the right. It is not so easy to define a case where an action would constitute an offence under existing legislation but would not do so if a slightly different test was introduced.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy that the recent highly-publicised case has nothing to do with this issue because nobody in this House will suggest that a person, having shot and beaten another, should be at liberty to return to a shed, reload his or her weapon, hunt down the other person and finish him or her off. Nobody will suggest that such action should not constitute an offence. I take it that there is unanimity in the House on that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike the Minister, I will not refer to that recent case. Nobody wants a situation to pertain where people can be killed with impunity.</P>
    <P>I will rise to the challenge the Minister has set. He is satisfied with the law as it stands but has suggested that if I come forward with a specific proposition, he will do as I have done with regard to some of this proposals, that is, if I find them reasonable, I support them. I will rise to his challenge but I expect the Minister to support any proposal I might bring forward if he believes it is reasonable. I can bring forward a proposal that is <Col N="1560"/>reasonable, will provide more of a defence for home owners, while not creating an imbalance in the law.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that proposal because the Deputy knows that during discussions at meetings of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights, I have made it clear that amendments to the criminal law emanating from any source, in the context of proposed legislation, will be considered in a fair and reasonable way. I look forward to seeing any proposal from Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe with regard to changing the law. I am not saying that the law is perfect but it is easy to talk about changing the law. I want to see exactly how the law could be changed and what difference any change could make.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Cuffe</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if he is satisfied that the Garda vetting unit is adequately resourced to deal with all requests from organisations seeking vetting services, in view of the recent revelations in the Ferns Report; the way in which the vetting unit will prioritise requests received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35803/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, an inter-agency working group on Garda vetting reported with a clear and focused strategy for enhancing national vetting arrangements from a child protection perspective. This strategy provided for an expansion in the criminal record vetting service provided by the Garda central vetting unit to all organisations which recruit persons having substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. This has significant implications for the education, child care, youth work, sports and voluntary sectors, among others. Religious organisations also fall within the terms of the strategy.</P>
    <P>To meet an increase in demand associated with such an expansion in the availability of vetting, the working group made a number of recommendations. It sought an additional ten civilian staff, to increase the vetting unit&rsquo;s strength from 13 to 23, reviewable after six months of expanded operation. However, when the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan and I considered this recommendation, we concluded that an extra 17 staff should be provided to the unit, to more than double its strength from 13 to 30. We provided more staff than was requested, as a recognition of the importance of vetting as a public policy issue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform Deputy Cuffe that the central vetting unit has now been successfully transferred to new, custom-designed office accommodation in Thurles, as part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. It will soon complete expansion of its vetting service in that location. I confirm that during its expan<Col N="1561"/>sion the matter of the adequacy of staff resources will be kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>The strategy is being overseen by an implementation group on Garda vetting which includes key stakeholders from the education, health, child care and sports sectors, as well as Mr. Paul Gilligan, chief executive officer of the ISPCC. The implementation group is overseeing the implementation of the practical recommendations of the report including the training of additional staff, accommodation matters, financial management arrangements, work process re-engineering and the preparation of client organisations and sectors for the availability of vetting.</P>
    <P>In terms of overall prioritisation across sectors, the central vetting unit will roll out its vetting service in the order in which each sector completes its own preparatory actions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the expansion of the Garda vetting unit. However, I wonder if the system can cope at the moment or will be able to cope in future with the significant number of applications it receives. When one talks to any of the relevant agencies it appears there is a near avalanche of requests being received by the unit. I hope applications will be prioritised in some way, particularly where children are most vulnerable. Some sports bodies, for example in swimming, have a history of problems with child abuse. It is simplistic to adopt a chronological approach. Is the Minister aware that the National Youth Council of Ireland states that at least 33,000 youth leaders will require vetting? Is he confident that a mere 30 people in the office in Thurles will be able to cope? What waiting time will apply?</P>
    <P>The Minister has promised legislation on reckless endangerment, using the state of Massachusetts as a model. Will he bring forward legislation to require bodies working with children to put in place a strong code of practice or vetting system for its staff? While some organisations, notably the Roman Catholic Church and Scouting Ireland, have put in place strong controls, many organisations have only rudimentary systems or none at all. Will he introduce such legislation so that children are not put at undue risk from voluntary bodies or other organisations?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an accumulated backlog of unvetted people which will take some time to deal with. As I indicated in my answer to the Deputy, these sectors will be dealt with by the vetting unit in chronological order as they get their requirements together. To vet 30,000 people the staff in the unit, given its current complement, would need to deal with 1,000 inquiries each in a year, which should be possible. If extra staff resources are required they will be recruited. As the Deputy knows, it is necessary in all but a small number of cases to impose a charge because we cannot have people repeatedly availing of a service without thinking carefully about the costs to the Exchequer. The new unit, in its purpose-<Col N="1562"/>built accommodation organised around this core function and with a significant civilian, as opposed to Garda, staff component, is the way forward and will greatly enhance the capacity of the State to vet people in areas where it is appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>If an organisation working with children submitted a request for vetting today how long does the Minister estimate it would take for the vetting unit in Thurles to give a definite response? Some of my staff have been on the payroll of the Houses of the Oireachtas for five months and have yet to receive security clearance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer a hypothetical question but security clearance is a radically different proposition from vetting provided by the central vetting unit. It arises in another question later today so I will not trespass on that but &ldquo;soft&rdquo; information, as opposed to &ldquo;hard&rdquo; information, is a requisite in a security vetting procedure whereas, as the Deputy knows, the inclusion of soft information on people on public records for use in the vetting procedure is problematic. I stress that negative clearance, which is what vetting amounts to, is not a substitute for a proper duty of care on those involved in recruiting people to perform functions involving children. Simply finding that somebody has no criminal record is not for the most part an adequate measure of the suitability of a person to undertake a task involving unsupervised access to vulnerable people.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>the reason it was necessary to purchase such a large site at Thornton Hall; his plans to develop the site further; if it is envisaged that other services will be provided at Thornton Hall; if not, if the excess land will be sold; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35719/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The size of the site purchased will provide for and enable the development to <Col N="1563"/>be carried out in a manner which is consistent with best practice from a planning perspective. It will also facilitate the provision of an integrated prison complex with ample recreational and therapeutic facilities. In addition, in line with a recent Government decision a site will be made available for the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital but this is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. There are no plans to dispose of any portion of the site or to provide for facilities other than those which have already been indicated.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison needs to be replaced. Conditions in Mountjoy have been severely criticised by the Council of Europe committee on the prevention of torture and other inhumane or degrading treatment. They have also been roundly condemned by the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention. Redeveloping the existing 20 acre site at Mountjoy is neither financially viable at an estimated cost of over &euro;400 million nor practical from an operational or developmental perspective. Even if this investment was made the site would remain constrained with no scope for football fields, a running track or other rehabilitative facilities.</P>
    <P>Building a new prison campus on a new site will open up new opportunities. The development of a greenfield site means we will have the room to develop progressive rehabilitative facilities and introduce single person cells with in-cell sanitation to end the inhumane practice of slopping out. The size of the Thornton site at 150 acres allows considerable flexibility for a campus style development with modern work practices, as well as allowing the Irish Prison Service to plan for the future taking into account the projected rise in our population. The Irish Prison Service estimates that annual savings on the costs implied by the present manning levels at Mountjoy Prison in the order of &euro;30,000 per prisoner per annum can be generated on a new greenfield site.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister again why he needs 150 acres at the exorbitant price of &euro;30 million, which is six, seven or even eight times the cost of land that is not zoned. If the land is not developed it will have to be sold on those terms. Will it be possible to build on the land, considering Fingal County Council is declaring a conservation area? The council is involved in a survey of archaeological and historical sites in the area. Will the Minister comment on that? The Grangegorman site has 65 acres, 35 being playing fields and 30 suitable for buildings. It envisages a student population of 20,000 to 30,000 with less than half the acreage of Thornton Hall. The site certainly seems large and it does not seem much of it can be built on.</P>

	<P>One time you stepped in and the other time you stepped out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to put on the record that in July last Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe announced that five acres, which was part of the farm at Thornton Hall that was kept back by the owner because it had planning permission potential, had a value of &euro;1 million per acre. However, later in this House, his party, not himself, said the remaining 150 acres had a total value of &euro;6 million. It is an interesting proposition that five acres was worth &euro;1 million while 150 acres was worth &euro;6 million. I do not accept these figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello implied that the project is not going ahead but I want to make it clear that it is going ahead. The land is suitable for the construction of a prison which will be built. It is political play-acting on the part of Deputy Costello who tried to send in Dublin City Council to prevent <Col N="1565"/>Mountjoy being redeveloped on historical grounds and some of his allies are now sending in Fingal County Council officials to try to preserve the land because of its historical and archaeological significance. A full survey is being carried out by the State on the land in question. All the requisite expertise will be deployed and the prison will be built on the site.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues on the value. Clearly the Minister has no clue about land values. Anyone who does not realise that five acres which is zoned for building has enormous value as opposed to agricultural land that is unzoned realises nothing. Incidentally, the five acres was originally supposed to be included and at the last minute it was excluded. This farm was the dearest farm in Europe. The Minister would not allow the Comptroller and Adjutant General to examine the situation before the sale was completed and I can see why.</P>
    <P>Given that the Minister has now completed the deal and thrown away the taxpayers&rsquo; money, is there not considerable evidence that this site is very unsuitable? Access is terribly bad and the roads are not suitable for the traffic at the moment. The public services are not in place, which it will cost a fortune to install. The Minister said to me at one stage that he would not listen to any old guff about fairy forts. If he had any sense of culture or history, would he not accept that there is a wealth of history and archaeology in the area? What timeframe is he proposing and what is the cost estimate for the structure he intends to build on the site?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe valued the five acres at &euro;1 million per acre.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not value it, a local valuer did it for me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough. The Deputy accepted this figure and put it into the public domain. I paid less than one fifth of that per acre for the remaining 150 acres.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>How suitable is it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The land in question is totally suitable for the purpose for which it was bought. It was examined carefully by a team of engineers. The report is available under FOI to anyone who wants to see it. The Deputy can examine it at any time if he wishes. He knows it was examined fully at the time of purchase. As an environmental impact procedure will be put in place, the Deputy need not worry about these matters.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a done deal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and the Deputy should know that it is suitable land. Road access to the land is not inadequate as has been suggested. I wonder has the Deputy driven up the long <Col N="1566"/>straight road, because he would be impressed by the road access to the land. It is not as inadequate as the Deputy is implying.</P>
    <P>On the construction of the prison campus, this will be done on a public private partnership basis. The Department of Finance&rsquo;s public private partnership experts and the treasury management agency&rsquo;s experts concurred that the first thing to do for a PPP for a prison is to acquire the site, which has been done. I cannot now put a cost estimate on the entire deal. In the nature of PPP tendering, it would be foolish of me to commit to that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Give me a ballpark figure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe it will run to &euro;200 million or &euro;300 million, depending on how extensive a prison facility is constructed. It will be between two and six years before it is completed fully. On the Mountjoy site, it is my intention to dispose of it. Given a proper planning scheme, it will recover for taxpayers well in excess of &euro;100 million.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Do not rush it. Do not throw away taxpayers&rsquo; money again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the facts and figures which indicate there were much cheaper sites. The services are now estimated to cost &euro;40 million, even though there was a previous low estimate of &euro;8 million. What has caused the increase? Will the Minister give an assurance that he will allow Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council to survey the sites at Thornton Hall and Mountjoy to see if there are conservation issues relating to architecture, heritage and history? We do not want him to be a total iconoclast and knock everything down. It is one thing to propose a new prison but it is another issue to demolish part of the heritage of this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike Deputy Costello, I believe that Mountjoy Prison should be demolished. There are a couple of features which can be retained as part of redevelopment of the site, including the execution shed which it is proposed to remove to Kilmainham.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister allow Dublin City Council to examine the site?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The work will go ahead and the campaign of obstruction against it will not succeed. I am amused by the neighbouring landowners who suddenly say that the fields I bought are of huge architectural significance. Who was there when they built their houses? No one has explained what is under their houses. Just because I buy land it becomes of architectural significance, while they have built a palazzi around it without carrying out any archaeological investigations.</P>

     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a judge (details supplied) dismissed 13 cases of alleged drink driving on 9 November 2005 due to the fact that the State, including the garda&iacute;, had refused to provide technical and operating data on the intoxilyser; if the issue will be addressed in order that other suspected drink driving cases are not dismissed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35713/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 13 prosecutions under section 49(4) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended, were dismissed by the district judge sitting at Belmullet District Court on 9 November 2005. An application has been made, by way of case stated, to review the decisions of the district judge.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law, and are independent in the exercise of their functions. These are matters entirely for the presiding judge and in the circumstances the House will understand that I am constrained from commenting on the conduct of a particular case. Without in any way commenting on the particular cases, where I have indicated a judicial review is pending, the House will be aware that it has been the practice for legislation relating to drink driving to be consistently challenged, often unsuccessfully, in the courts. The Government is committed to dealing effectively with the problem of drink driving and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary in this regard.</P>
<P>The Department of Transport and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been considering for some time an amendment of the Road Traffic Acts to provide that in some cases persons who are found to be over the limit will be the subject of a non-court procedure in which a prosecution will not be taken if they pay a fixed penalty, surrender their licence for endorsement and consent to an administrative disqualification. If the Department of Transport, which is responsible for policy in this area, proceeds with the proposal, the Garda Commissioner is of the view that very considerable savings in court time and Garda time will result.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that drink-driving is a scourge of this country? Last weekend there were ten fatalities on the roads. Does he agree the operation of the intoxilyser has been a comedy of errors since it was introduced? There have been thousands, if not tens of thousands, of drink-driving charges that have had to be thrown out of the courts because there was no <Col N="1568"/>paper trail, something about which we know from electronic voting. In the case of drink-driving, the problem is the agencies of the State, including the garda&iacute;, would not provide the relevant technical data so they could be examined. Arising from that the judge decided to dismiss 13 cases. The State should be obliged to make available relevant material that a judge deems appropriate in her court. It did not do that.</P>
    <P>I am not asking about something that may be introduced some time in the future but about what we have now and why the garda&iacute;, for whom the Minister is responsible, did not carry out their duty properly. Has the Minister examined this? How will he address it in future so we do not have a situation where people can constantly challenge cases while the garda&iacute; do not fulfil their role?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The courts are independent under the Constitution and carry out their functions independently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is irrelevant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not comment on a decision that is to be the subject of an appellate process. The decision on whether to provide information requested is primarily for the person having carriage of the prosecution, the Director of Public Prosecutions. He is the person in charge of a prosecution and it falls to him to decide what information is supplied or what facilities for examination should be granted to the defence in any case. I do not issue directives to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to how it should conduct cases or the examinations it should carry out in response to solicitors&rsquo; requests. That is a matter for the DPP, who is independent. It is not my responsibility.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, the intoxilyser equipment works perfectly well and if people want to test it, the extent to which they are free to do so is a matter to be determined in the context of a criminal prosecution between the solicitors acting for the accused and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am sure the garda&iacute; will abide by any directions they get from the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether the machine should be examined, dismantled or made available to others. It is a matter for the DPP and for the courts, including the judge in a case and any appellate court, to decide if that is a legitimate request to make and the extent to which the State is obliged to provide facilities for the second guessing of the machine and its technical examination and testing by independent witnesses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying the reason the garda&iacute; refused to provide the technical and operational data on the intoxilyser that were requested was that the Director of Public Prosecutions was consulted and said they should not be provided? Is he saying someone else told the garda&iacute; not to provide the data or did they decide not to provide them themselves? Where does the <Col N="1569"/>buck stop? The Minister says he has no role in this but at a minimum he could find out what exactly happened and who was responsible for the decision that resulted in the judge throwing out 13 cases which, no doubt, will result in all other cases coming along being put on the back burner until the matter is dealt with by a higher court.</P>
    <P>Once again the intoxilyser has been brought into ill repute, even though it is fine equipment, because the procedures under which it has been operated leave much to be desired. If the State is not prepared to play its part, there is not much sense in the Joint Committee on Transport meeting to decide if it is a constitutional matter to have random breath testing. We cannot get prosecutions from the intoxilyser without full co-operation from the people who operate it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister does not want to interfere in individual cases but an important point arises here. Were the cases in question dismissed without prejudice? Is this the end of the matter or are they going to the High Court?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that in the main it would not be interfering with court proceedings for this House and the Minister to send a message that any reasonable requests from judges in the hearing of cases should be acceded to as far as possible?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the point that must be decided by the courts and not by me. It is not appropriate for me to express opinions on the merits of an outcome.</P>

	<P>What if a request was reasonable?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is reasonable, a set of implications follows but if it is not correctly legally based, other inferences must be drawn. I am not in a position to speculate on what a court will decide on these issues and it would not help if I did so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the garda&iacute; refuse?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In a process of discovery in a criminal prosecution decisions are primarily for the prosecutor because we have an adversarial legal system. The prosecutor decides if, as part of bringing the case, he will make available certain information. It is not the function of the Minister to send directives to the garda&iacute; as to what they should do in particular cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>So the DPP instructed the garda&iacute;.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be wholly unaware of the state of litigation in any particular case and would have no reason to become <Col N="1570"/>involved. These are matters left by the Constitution for others to decide.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the DPP make the decision?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware who made the decision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister not check? A question was asked in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is certainly not, however, a decision made in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

     <Quest>if the proposed development of the new prison at Thornton Hall has passed the preliminary PPP appraisal stage; if it has been approved by the NDFA as suitable for public private procurement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35717/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has approved in principle the development of a new prison complex on the Thornton site on a value for money PPP basis. The Irish Prison Service is preparing a detailed assessment of the project in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for the provision of capital projects through public private partnerships which will result in a detailed business case being provided. The National Development Finance Agency is advising the prison service on these matters.</P>
    <P>The PPP procurement method allows full access to the expertise of the private sector in the development and management of major capital projects and allows for the transfer of risk from the Exchequer to the private sector. The National Economic and Social Council has concluded that PPPs have the potential to play a pivotal role in supporting the accelerated delivery of strategic national infrastructure, to yield long-term value for money for the Exchequer and to ensure quality public services.</P>
    <P>Initial discussions with the Department of Finance and the National Development Finance Agency indicated that this project was suitable for a PPP procurement approach on the basis of a design, build and maintain basis. It was also established that it would not be feasible to have a proper competitive process unless a suitable site was acquired in advance.</P>
    <P>The PPP has a value for money test built into the process. This exercise evaluates the preferred tenders against the public sector benchmark, PSB, to ensure the selected tenders deliver value for money for the Exchequer over the duration of the contract. It is envisaged the new prison at Thornton will be delivered on a design, build, finance and maintain basis over a 25 year period.</P>
    <P>The PSB consists of a comprehensive, detailed risk adjusted costing of the project elements using <Col N="1571"/>conventional State procurement methods. The drawing up of the public sector benchmark and associated detailed business case is a complicated process.</P>
    <P>A business case and public sector benchmark will be completed for the proposed new prison development. This will cost the project both as a PPP project and as a normal Exchequer finance project. It is anticipated this will be completed in February 2006. This will be the subject of discussions with the technical consultants on the substantive project. These consultants will be appointed shortly. The National Development Finance Agency is advising the Irish Prison Service on this process and the Department of Finance will evaluate this process, ensuring the most economically advantageous option to the State is selected.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. It contains a great deal of information, which I look forward to reading in detail. This is a stand-alone project and it qualifies as a PPP in regard to its appraisal. The Minister stated the design, build and maintenance of the project would be undertaken by a private company. Does he propose that such a company will also run the campus? Does he propose to privatise the escort service and so on? Will consultants be hired and, if so, will the contract be put out to tender? The Minister stated the building will cost a minimum of &euro;200 million to build but it will probably be double that if consideration is being given to the combined institutions. Is the proposed site of the Central Mental Hospital factored into the cost of the project or will the site only house a prison? Will the Minister or the Prison Service outline their plans in this regard to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the process envisaged, consultants will be appointed because that is justifiable in these circumstances. I visited the Midlands Prison last Monday. The new buildings were constructed there on a quasi-PPP basis in good time and to a high quality. It compares favourably with the construction of prison buildings in the past, which caused substantial problems.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a danger they will become Ceaucescu-like buildings?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No. This is a design, build and maintenance project and, therefore, the prisons will not be operated privately, similar to those in America and the UK. I intend to keep the operation of prisons within the public sector as long as that is economically feasible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>&ldquo;Almost&rdquo; makes me a socialist but not quite. With regard to transport, it is not my intention, unless I am forced to do so in the future, to outsource escort services. On Monday I was informed that the new cellular transport vans are in operation and they are proving a success. They are operated by Prison Service staff.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister stated the capital cost of the project would be between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million. Did he come up with this figure off the top of his head or has he received expert advice? Perhaps he received more advice than when he purchased the site.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What is &euro;100 million after all?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>How much will the associated project, the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital to the same campus, cost? The Minister is giving himself a significant timeframe of between two and six years to complete the project. Can he give a more accurate timeframe?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to give misleading information and, therefore, I stated the cost would be between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million because if I stated hundreds of millions, the figure would be leapt on and we would be at &euro;1 billion before we finished.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the private sector tenderers for a PPP must submit competitive tenders and I will not, therefore, outline the cost. Even if I could offer an educated guess, it would not be helpful.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not, therefore, an uneducated guess.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not being offered as an educated guess. If the Minister for Health and Children decides to relocate the Central Mental Hospital, land will be available at Thornton Hall for that purpose. A significant capital dividend will accrue to the State because the lands at Dundrum have a colossal redevelopment value. The premises on the site are wholly unsuitable for the purpose for which they are used.</P>

	<P>Deputy Quinn was in possession and he has nine minutes remaining.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the debate was adjourned, I referred to the need for European citizens to reconnect with the European project and the realisation that the federal structure implicit in the decision making nature of the Council, the Commission and the Parliament was not meeting that task in the media coverage of European politics in the 25 member states. I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago, the Joint Committee on European Affairs agreed an uncontentious proposal I initiated to bridge the gap between the perception and the political reality, which is that 70% of the legislation dealt with in the Parliaments of member states originates in the European institutions in Brussels. How can reportage be generated locally, which reflects the scrutiny given by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to the same legislation when it originates in the Commission? There is only so much space and time for European affairs because of the commercialisation of the media since Mr. Murdoch and others took over the main media outlets. Coverage is limited on RTE and in broadsheet newspapers to what happens in the Houses of the Oireachtas. If we do not &ldquo;Europeanise&rdquo; time, European affairs will not receive the coverage required and our citizens will feel they <Col N="1574"/>are not properly informed about what is happening.</P>
    <P>My proposal, copies of which I will make available if Members wish, is that there should be a European week during every plenary session. Questions to all the Ministers would have a European dimension. For example, a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could be about the implementation of the Building Control Bill and how the European directive on energy and new buildings would be implemented, which is a requirement under European law directly originating from European legislation at a European level, transposed into domestic law. We would focus on that. Questions to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and so on would be prioritised in terms of matters which related to European issues or those originating from a European directive or proposal.</P>
    <P>On a Wednesday morning in this House we would have a commissioner who would sit where the Minister for Foreign Affairs now sits, for example, Laszlo Kovacs, the commissioner responsible for taxation within the Commission, or any commissioner other than the Irish commissioner, who would be somewhere else. Any national parliament would not have its national commissioner sitting. The commissioner sitting in this House, for example Laszlo Kovacs, would talk about the vexed issues of taxation, harmonisation, the current stress on the US Treasury by the IRS with regard to what they &mdash; not us &mdash; would see as the abuse of our taxation system, and how it is being used for transfer pricing; and all the pressures and internal competitions that relate to the issues of harmonisation and a common platform for the measuring of corporation tax. That is just one example.</P>
    <P>Laszlo Kovacs, a former Member of the Hungarian Parliament, a former leader of the Socialist Party there, and a Foreign Affairs Minister, would not only sit and deliver a speech to the rest of us, but we could ask him questions in the same way we can ask questions of our Ministers. The media, who are ever present in one form or another, would be able to report on these issues because there would be no other domestic dispute or issue arising.</P>
    <P>Leader&rsquo;s Questions would obviously be retained for contemporaneous issues of domestic concern but all else would have a European focus. That would be the case in this Chamber. What would happen in the Seanad? I will propose an illustration which would hold true for all Senates across the European Union where bi-cameral systems operate, and where it would be for each parliament to adopt its integration. I will give the Irish illustration of how it would work.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad on a Thursday, so as not to compete with media coverage on the Wednesday, an illustrative and useful example of what would be newsworthy would be the chairperson of the agricultural committee of the European Parliament <Col N="1575"/>in the Seanad, with all Republic of Ireland MEPs in session and with the rights of question and access, debating why the European Commission has to introduce the sugar regime because of the fines threatened under the WTO rules. The consequences of that will, according to all the analysts, see the virtual elimination of the Irish sugar industry as we know it over the next five or six years, with appropriate compensation. It is necessary for the European Commission and the EU to comply with the WTO in terms of reducing our unjust subsidy of sugar prices in world terms in return for our access to other markets elsewhere.</P>
    <P>They are only two illustrative examples and Members can think of many more which affect them. If we had those issues discussed here in this national parliament, and in every other national parliament, the political connection between what is happening to our citizens and voters in our constituencies at one level would be directly related to the decisions made by councils of ministers and members of parliaments in response to European Commission proposals. That connection is not currently apparent and its absence was a contributing factor to the reason many citizens, in addition to those who previously voted before, voted for the first time in the Netherlands and in France in the way they did, regarding the EU. If such a connection existed, people would see the re-connection between the European ideal and projects at one level and what the EU is doing at national level on people&rsquo;s behalf, either for or against their interests.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to consider that unless, during the period of reflection, we see some positive, active, innovative initiatives coming from small member states we will not get anything from the bigger member states. We have one prime minister, Mr. Blair, on his way out; President Chirac does not know if he will be a candidate again in 2007; we have a new Chancellor of Germany who has yet to find her feet; and Italy faces an election next April. Accordingly we cannot expect any political initiative or leadership from the four traditional major European countries. The drive in this instance, which should reflect the culture of the 25 EU countries, should come from the smaller countries.</P>
    <P>There is no better country poised to lead that initiative than Ireland. The way in which Deputy Roche, while Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, co-ordinated activity in terms of the run-up to the ratification of the constitution treaty, is a tried and tested way of doing business. Ireland has seniority among the new ten entrant countries and among other countries and we should use that seniority to use the period of reflection not as some passive period of inaction but as an active period of intervention coming from the small member states. This is a unique opportunity.</P>

   <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Harkin and Gormley.</P>
    <P>While I welcome any opportunity to critically discuss the European Union, I find the format of this debate wholly inadequate. If the EU is to emerge from this crisis and come into line with public preferences, a series of focused debates is needed on a range of issues which have been expressly identified by people across Europe as being unacceptable. These issues include the neo-liberal trajectory of the EU, ever-increasing militarisation and the endemic democratic deficit. If people in Europe are to feel they are being listened to, these debates must have a real, visible and timely impact on the institutions and operations of the EU.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn said, with only five minutes to discuss the current situation in the European Union and the constitutional treaty, where does one begin? To start, the EU constitution is dead and the Government needs to get through the grieving period and move on. Sinn F&eacute;in wants Ireland to move on and begin a long overdue debate on the future of Europe. This debate must be based on an acknowledgment that the referenda in France and the Netherlands, and opinion polls from other European countries, demonstrate that the current socio-economic model, namely the content of the EU constitution, is not working and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Despite the defeat of the constitution, Sinn F&eacute;in felt a responsibility to launch an information campaign on it last month. Our initiative was in response to the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on the EU constitution. The Government is marketing its document as a factual account of the contents of the constitution but it is essentially a piece of propaganda, the primary purpose of which is to sell the constitution. The White Paper attempts to do so via the editorial strategy, which is to extract articles from the constitution and paraphrase selectively. It frequently dismisses or diminishes the significance of substantive changes. This is no surprise, as the Fianna F&aacute;i-Progressive Democrats programme for Government asserts that &ldquo;any perception either within the EU or outside that Ireland was other than a fully committed member would be deeply damaging&rdquo;.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The policy pattern resulting from this foundation is one of a refusal to criticise EU measures, even those in direct opposition to the expressed wishes of the Irish people. By contrast, Sinn F&eacute;in is not afraid to stand up against EU measures which are damaging to Irish interests. Our policy on the EU is one of principled, critical engagement. This means that we decide to support or oppose the many and complex developments in the EU, each on its own merits, using the criteria of democracy, transparency and accountability, equality and human rights compliance, the effect on Irish sovereignty and the potential for promoting Irish unity.</P><Col N="1577"/>
   
    <P>One such area is the Hague programme. The time available to me to give it the attention it requires is grossly insufficient. Suffice to say that the Hague programme is fundamentally flawed, with its flaws exacerbated by an action plan which front-loads contentious measures relating for example to the transfer of sentenced persons, judicial and police co-operation ahead of measures relating to minimum standards in the taking of evidence, pre-trial detention procedures and work with respect to police standards. Elements of this action plan are dependent on the EU constitution. In light of its defeat, a moratorium should be introduced on the passage through this House of all further EU measures stemming from the Hague programme, pending the outcome of a full review and debate. I reiterate the demand I have made on several occasions, particularly on the Order of Business, for the need for a full debate on the Hague programme, the necessity for which has been acknowledged by the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his Department officials. I ask the Minister to include in his closing remarks a guarantee that this debate will take place and an indication of the date. It is important that we debate it. That is something that none of us would be either averse to or afraid of.</P>
    <P>Sinn F&eacute;in has an electoral mandate to engage with EU policy by challenging the democratic deficit and all those policies that are adverse to Irish interests and promoting an agenda with quality and a meaningful act of citizenship within Europe. I stress a meaningful act of citizenship within Europe because that is what I believe we should be about. In the coming period Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to encourage genuine debate in this House and throughout the country on the European Union, its current policies and neo-liberal policy trajectory, and on the quality of the Government&rsquo;s representation of this and engagement with it. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply at the conclusion of the debate.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I spent some time this morning writing a five-minute speech to deliver this afternoon but I have decided to scrap it. I had intended to speak briefly about the EU budget, the foot-dragging that is taking place and the knock-on effect for the Structural Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the rural development funds and so on. I intended to mention that for the 11th year in a row the European Court of Auditors could not sign off on the EU budget and that the Finance Ministers last month refused to sign a declaration of assurances on their accounts.</P>
    <P>I intended also to speak briefly on the World Trade Organisation negotiations and how Peter Mandelson is definitely going beyond his remit when it comes to agriculture and how Tony Blair does not seem to realise we have had Common Agricultural Policy reform. I intended to speak about the information deficit, referred to by many <Col N="1578"/>Deputies, and Margot Wallstr&ouml;m and her plan D, where she speaks about debate, dialogue and democracy, so that citizens have some opportunity to know what is going on in the EU.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in and taken with what Deputy Quinn said about the European week. It is an excellent suggestion to which I hope the Minister will pay attention. He is talking about a real, down to earth way of translating theory into reality so that people who are interested have an opportunity to see how EU legislation impacts on their lives and how it is not just something going on in Brussels. I hope the Minister will take note of what Deputy Quinn said as some of his ideas were excellent.</P>
    <P>While all these points are worth making and the debate has been informative, citizens need more than information from the EU. They need to see results. They need to see the EU working for them, protecting their interests and making a positive difference in their lives. The reason I have decided to change what I was going to say was that I have come from Buswells Hotel where I met a delegation of pig farmers who are extremely concerned about their livelihoods under the proposed nitrates directive. These farmers got no help from the EU, yet these new proposals can literally put them out of business. That is real life. We can talk about information, the European constitution, globalisation &mdash; we need to do so &mdash; but if the EU does not work for its citizens, then to some extent it is all hot air because nobody is listening to us.</P>
    <P>Pig farmers are genuinely concerned they are going out of business. This comes down to excessive regulation and changes in the regulation, for example, the amount of nitrogen considered to be deposited on land by a sow has overnight been increased from 67 kg to 80 kg with target indices reduced from three to two. I listened to the farmers and I said I do not know how anybody farms in Ireland because of the excess regulation with which people must live. Some of those decisions come overnight. How can those farmers trust the EU and trust it is looking out for their interests? One farmer said to me there is a global picture here. We all live on a small planet and we have a good deal of regulation here.</P>
    <P>If pigs are being produced in Monaghan, Roscommon or Sligo, at least they are being produced under certain conditions. If Irish pig farmers go out of business, that pigmeat will be produced somewhere else in the world but not under the same kind of regulation. At the end of the day, those trying to save the planet to some extent are damaging it. That is a general statement and there are details in it that need to be worked out. As a general statement it is true.</P>
    <P>There are other Irish farmers who must have traceability from farm to fork, and so they should. New veterinary legislation is being implemented which makes life more difficult for them. They must compete with imports from South America where they are not working on a level playing <Col N="1579"/>pitch and where animals are produced under very different conditions. European farmers are concerned that the European model of agriculture is not being protected by the EU. Other workers look to the services directives and hope their jobs will be protected while at the same time it will boost competitiveness within the EU.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Quinn said about the EU Council of Ministers making laws in public. That is a decision that could be taken overnight and it is a positive sign to EU citizens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This discussion is somewhat redundant given the rejection of the constitution by France and the Netherlands. Already there are some voices saying we must continue with the ratification process, that these countries cannot be allowed to stall progress, including Angela Merkel, who has been elected as the Chancellor of Germany. It is a pity people are arguing this point because these are the people who rejected the idea of a Europe-wide referendum, a proposition I put to the Convention on the Future of Europe. This would have operated with a double majority &mdash; a majority of citizens and a majority of states. It makes sense. It made no sense that a member state could have a veto on such an important issue. However, my proposal was voted down and those same people who voted down that proposal argue that a referendum is a crude instrument and one cannot give such an important decision to people.</P>
    <P>Democracy should be at the heart of the European project. That is the reason a Europe-wide referendum is a good proposal. I ask the Minister to put that proposal back on the table. If the Minister says the French will have to vote again and if we are continuing with the ratification process, that means the French and the Dutch will have to vote again. If one thinks the French riots are bad now, they are a picnic compared with what will be experienced in France if this issue is put to them again. We Irish like to think of ourselves as rebels but, in fact, we are pretty docile and passive compared with the French. I ask the Minister to take that issue on board. We ought to have a Europe-wide referendum.</P>
    <P>A constitution for Europe is not only necessary but desirable but this constitution, if we did have a Europe-wide referendum, would be rejected. We must go back to the drawing board. It is possible to get a constitution the people of Europe will support. I say the people because there is a democratic deficit. There is a European elite that is pushing a constitution which people do not want. The Minister will have to accept that. Let us go back.</P>
    <P>There is no question there are good things in this constitution, including the opening up of European Council meetings. I welcome the citizens&rsquo; initiative, the first draft of which I put forward. I welcome also a charter for fundamental rights but I refer to the Government&rsquo;s White <Col N="1580"/>Paper in which it is clear we have different interpretations of such a charter. Recently, I had a debate with John Palmer who said this charter of fundamental rights is fully justiciable. It is important because there is no doubt this constitution also enshrines neo-liberal values, as has been alluded to already. We need a charter for fundamental rights which is fully justiciable. There are right-wing elements in this Government that boast about the fact they and the British have stopped the charter for fundamental rights in its tracks. This document suggests that the Government has managed to stop the so-called horizontal clauses. Point 15 of Chapter 4 of the White Paper states: &ldquo;An important distinction is made between rights and principles. Principles are not directly justiciable&rdquo;. I wish that they were. Examples of articles containing principles are those relating to the rights of the elderly the integration of persons with disabilities and environmental protection. The Government is stating that it has managed to stop progress in these areas, which I do not welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that considerable spin is going on here. I do not welcome that the White Paper states: &ldquo;Member States shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities. But no specific requirements as to the level of military spending are involved, nor is there any binding requirement to increase it.&rdquo; The Government is trying to inform us not to bother our little heads about it, as it is not that important. I know it is important, as I was a member of the defence working group.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on what the previous speaker mentioned. Environmental protection is very important. It is an area in which the EU has made advances, which is why I support rigorous EU environmental legislation. However, at World Trade Organisation negotiations environmental protection is often seen as a protectionist measure. Environmental protection must be integrated into the World Trade Organisation talks if we are to have a sustainable future.</P>
    <P>The type of Europe I want is a social, sustainable, democratic and peaceful Europe.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Even though the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will wind up at the end of the debate, I wish to make some remarks in response to some of the issues raised by the Deputies. Deputy Allen spoke about Iran and its nuclear capability. Ireland has full confidence in the EU three in this matter. As I have previously said at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, we are briefed on a regular basis and were briefed on the current situation as recently <Col N="1581"/>as Monday. I accept that it is an extremely difficult and potentially dangerous topic, probably one of the most difficult on our agenda at the moment. The three member states are carrying out their discussions and negotiations with the full <i>imprimatur </i>of the 25. Their involvement on behalf of the EU has had a calming effect on a potentially more divisive international debate. It should be allowed to continue in this respect.</P>
    <P>As always Deputy Quinn made very constructive remarks and suggestions on these issues. I entirely agree with him on the need to instil leadership in how we proceed in what is a difficult but not unique situation. The EU has been in difficult situations before. I agree with his suggestion for more public meetings of European Councils of Ministers. Ireland will continue to promote more transparency in these matters. If the constitution had been given a chance in that respect, this matter would have been progressed. He suggested better connections between the European and national parliaments in both decisions and the level of scrutiny. All parliaments need to know more. We learnt from the first referendum on the Nice treaty and we have introduced an element of scrutiny. Perhaps we should do more. I am open to considering some of the issues raised by the joint committee in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in made a point about debate. It is a matter for the Whips to agree what can be debated in the House. I accept that in debates such as this we do not get a huge opportunity to go into issues in detail. However, this is one of the reasons for having the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley said that the European constitution was redundant. Whatever I am, I am a democrat. A number of countries have already ratified the constitution including two by referenda. What are we to say to those countries given that when we originally started on this road we agreed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Deputy was part of the convention. It was agreed that we would endeavour to ratify and return later if any countries had not ratified. We need to allow the period of reflection and positive engagement which were the words that Ireland suggested at the meeting to discuss this issue.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will concentrate on a number of issues which occupy the attention of foreign ministers at the moment. While the Union can readily function without a constitution for some time to come, which is accepted, having adequate financial resources is an immediate and indis<Col N="1582"/>pensable requirement. The EU&rsquo;s current annual budget is in the region of &euro;100 billion which, although a very large amount of money, represents 1% of the combined wealth of the member states. The relatively small scale of its budget gives the lie to the notion of the Union as a super-state in the making. Clearly, it is not. Instead, the Union functions at a certain level to pool and augment national authority in agreed ways for our collective betterment.</P>
    <P>The Union&rsquo;s budget is used for three main purposes: to fund the Common Agricultural Policy and rural development generally; to support the development of less prosperous regions; and to improve Europe&rsquo;s economic competitiveness in the face of intensifying international competition. Let us take the Union&rsquo;s agricultural spending as an example. The CAP is a pillar of the Union, without which European agriculture would be in real difficulty and Irish farmers would suffer. There are no grounds for being defensive about the CAP. Those who criticise it conveniently ignore that it has been repeatedly reformed to make it more cost-effective and market-oriented.</P>
    <P>The CAP has been shaped by the member states to meet the Union&rsquo;s evolving needs. It has not been foisted on the unwilling as is often implied by its critics. Agriculture is the only policy that is fully funded at European level. Under the most recent budgetary proposals, CAP is destined to consume a declining portion of the overall EU budget and just over 0.3% of Europe&rsquo;s gross national income. This is hardly a disproportionate price to pay to sustain a world-class European agriculture with all that this entails in terms, for example, of animal health and food safety. The EU represents one of the best blocs in the world in this respect.</P>
    <P>The EU budget&rsquo;s second priority is economic and social cohesion, which has benefited Ireland enormously over the years. It is clear that the new member states have particular development needs and that European funding is especially important for them. We can sympathise with their desire to catch up with the Union&rsquo;s wealthier regions as quickly as possible. For this reason, Ireland has stood squarely behind the principle of economic solidarity that lies at the kernel of the Union&rsquo;s success to date.</P>
    <P>The third main strand of EU spending is in the area of competitiveness. The budgetary proposals made by the Luxembourg Presidency envisaged a substantial rise in expenditure in this field. It is generally agreed that the Union needs to step up its performance if we are to secure Europe&rsquo;s prosperity in a rapidly changing global environment. While the implementation of the Lisbon Agenda falls largely within individual national competences, it makes sense to augment the efforts of individual governments with a strategic approach at the European level, for example in pursuit of excellence in research and development. In these ongoing negotiations, we have argued for a budget that will be adequate to fund <Col N="1583"/>the Union&rsquo;s core policies. Even though we have become one of the wealthier member states, we have not used this as an excuse for curtailing the Union&rsquo;s budget.</P>
    <P>The accession of so many countries whose economies are less developed than those of the existing membership has inevitable financial consequences and the Union must be prepared to face up to these. With such little time left, we have entered an intensive phase of the negotiations on the future financial perspectives for the years from 2007 to 2013. After a disappointing failure in June, when difficulties over the British rebate prevented agreement, we have a second chance to get it right in December. For the sake of the Union&rsquo;s credibility, we must grasp this latest opportunity. There is a particular responsibility on the current British Presidency to create the conditions for the agreement that so narrowly eluded us in June.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government&rsquo;s approach is designed to secure the best possible deal for Ireland in these complex and difficult negotiations. We will play our full role in the search for this much-needed agreement, which will have a tangibly positive impact on the future of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The second priority issue for Foreign Ministers at present is the WTO negotiations which will reach a crucial stage at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting next month. The WTO provides another example of the important role played by the European Union. The Commission has been given the responsibility to negotiate on behalf of the Union. This ensures that collective European interests are represented in a manner that would not be possible if all of us negotiated separately. The Commission&rsquo;s negotiators are required to remain within the mandate given to it by the Council. I have had occasion to remind the Commission of this fact at a number of recent meetings.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what many in the international media have said in recent weeks, the Union has been to the fore in trying to bring about a balanced WTO agreement. Positive proposals have been put forward while other parties to the talks have held back. As far as agriculture is concerned, the CAP reforms agreed in 2003 constituted an important EU contribution to the current trade negotiations. EU Foreign Ministers have made it quite clear that these CAP reforms constitute the limits of Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s negotiating brief. The Government will be extremely vigilant to ensure that these limits are respected. The final decision on the EU&rsquo;s response to whatever emerges in Hong Kong rests with the Council of Ministers. The issues do not just concern agriculture and trade issues. The WTO and Doha agenda are about looking after the world&rsquo;s poorest countries, and Ireland has emphasised that in all the discussions we have had at EU level.</P><Col N="1584"/>
    <P>I would like to have had time to touch on issues relating to the constitution. I reiterate that we have an opportunity for a period of reflection. I compliment the National Forum on Europe for the work it has done. The White Paper we have issued will allow people a period of calm and collective period of reflection and positive engagement, particularly through the National Forum on Europe and other bodies such as the European Movement Ireland, with which Deputy Quinn and a number of other Deputies are associated. We must continue to articulate calmly the positive nature of membership of the European Union. We must show the positive path of what we were trying to do with the European constitution, namely, to make the larger group of 25 more effective and efficient.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I will share time with Deputies Boyle and Ferris.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of the EU constitutional treaty. I will demonstrate a different perspective, but it is one that should be considered by all Members of the House. Unfortunately, people who provide an alternative or different view, particularly people who represent working people, are often dismissed by the EU bureaucrats who fail to listen to the people on the ground.</P>
    <P>The experience in France and other countries has shown that the citizens of Europe are more open and broad-minded than many elected leaders think. I am reminded of what Victor Hugo said to the French Assembly in 1848: &ldquo;What Paris advises, Europe considers; what Paris decides, Europe continues&rdquo;. The constitutional treaty is severely damaged. In a 70% turnout on 29 May, 55% of the French voters killed off the 448 article monstrosity. The Dutch voters buried it a few days later. These results have been greeted with shock and hysteria by European leaders and editors. They believed their own propaganda and can, therefore, only respond with incomprehension. Like the 18th century aristocrats, they peer over the parapets and remark that the French are revolting.</P>
    <P>Since the European leaders and opinion makers are politically bankrupt, they resort to psychological terms to explain what has happened. They say it is an outbreak of madness and that the French thought they were voting against Chirac. Perhaps it did not happen. They believe that France and the Netherlands have isolated themselves and that we can continue as if it never happened. However, it did happen and it is important we recognise that. It happened despite the best efforts of government parties and the main opposition party. It happened despite the overwhelming support of the French media.</P>
    <P>It is important we accept the reality that people have major concerns about the way Europe is drifting. They have major concerns that this European constitution and the proposed plans for other aspects of it are out of touch with them. <Col N="1585"/>The draft constitution is a plan for a more centralised, more unequal and more undemocratic Union, further removed from ordinary citizens and more under the control of the political elites of the big member states such as Germany and France.</P>
    <P>Up to now the European Union has been based on treaties between its members. It has been the creation of its member states and could not exist without them. The proposed treaty establishing a constitution for Europe sets out what is legally and constitutionally a new European Union, founded on its own state constitution. It makes the European Union an international actor in its own right, with legal personality and independent existence. It is separate from and superior to its member states, and able to negotiate treaties with foreign states on behalf of its members. Member states would become provinces of a centralised EU state whose policies are decided by supranational committees, the European Commission and the Council and Court of Justice, which in turn are run by undemocratic elites that are not elected by citizens nor under their control.</P>
    <P>The treaty establishing a constitution for Europe repeals all the existing EU-EC treaties from the Treaty of Rome to the Treaty of Nice and incorporates their main elements into an EU state constitution. This was an opportunity to reassess these elements, repatriate powers back from Brussels to the member states and remedy some of the things that are drastically wrong with the Union, for example, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy, EURATOM and the endless Brussels rules and regulations. However, the constitutional treaty makes no attempt to do this.</P>
    <P>The people of Europe have not sought this EU constitution. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing&rsquo;s convention which drafted it failed to carry out the terms of reference given by the EU governments in the Laeken declaration. This called for &ldquo;more democracy, transparency and efficiency&rdquo; in the European Union, reforms that would bring the Union &ldquo;closer to citizens&rdquo; and the possibility of &ldquo;restoring tasks to the Member States&rdquo;. The draft constitution does not propose restoring a single power from Brussels to the member states.</P>
    <P>Article 1.10 of the constitution states: &ldquo;The Constitution, and law adopted by the Union&rsquo;s Institutions in exercising competences conferred on it, shall have primacy over the law of the Member States&rdquo;. This has never been stated in an EU treaty before. Moreover, it applies to all areas of government, not just the mainly economic areas covered by previous EC-EU treaties. This provision abolishes the political independence of the member states. Constitutionally and politically they become like provinces of an EU state, with their national constitutions and laws subordinate to the EU constitution and laws.</P>
    <P>In this short contribution I have presented a different view of Europe. I like to have an international view of the world. I fully support coun<Col N="1586"/>tries co-operating and working together internationally. However, I do not support nor do I understand countries which want to interfere in the internal affairs of nation states.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Debate on the future of the European Union is always welcome, but a debate on the White Paper submitted by the Government on the future of the constitutional European Union treaty is a surreal event. This is a dead treaty. It is no more.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs may protest as much as he likes about being a democrat and say that two states have indicated support in referenda, but two other states have not. If we aggregate the four countries, the people have dramatically said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this treaty, not to the European Union itself. The difficulty in the progress of the European Union is not with the idea of a European Union or whether it could and should progress, it is about the vision being imposed by too small a group of people that did not involve the wider populace of the European countries involved in membership. If that lesson is not taken on board by the elites which are involved in the decision-making processes in the 25 member states, further progress will be very difficult, if not impossible.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has been constantly misrepresented as being anti-EU, even though it favours further integration and the continued development of a European idea. It does not want to see the development of a European Union that is not democratic and people-centred.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley did not say that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am in total agreement with Deputy Gormley. The Minister of State, his party and the Government refuse to listen to the Green Party&rsquo;s alternative vision of what the European Union can and should be. Rather than listening to the Green Party&rsquo;s ideas and working towards a better version of the European Union, those who have been making the decisions and advancing this process like a juggernaut have chosen to run a steamroller over people&rsquo;s opinions.</P>
    <P>It is no coincidence that more often than not, people in EU member states have chosen to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when EU treaties and other EU matters have been submitted to them for their opinions. I refer to the Danish vote on the Maastricht treaty, the French and Danish votes on the proposed European constitution, the Swedish vote on the European currency, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s attitude to EU matters and this country&rsquo;s vote on the Nice treaty. The involvement of the general populace in such decisions tends to happen too late in the day for people to feel any identification with the matters under consideration. Voters do not have a sense of ownership of what the European Union is and what it could be.</P>
    <P>The Government White Paper on the proposed European constitution has been made even more <Col N="1587"/>ridiculous by the events of the last week such as the IFA sugar protest in Mallow. Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas were briefed yesterday on the position being adopted by the European Commissioner, Mr. Mandelson, at the World Trade Organisation talks. It is likely that any future referendum on an EU treaty will not receive the substantial level of support from the farming community that similar proposals have received in the past. The current circumstances of such people are far removed from the promises which were made to them in the past when the benefits of EU membership were being sold to them.</P>
    <P>Many of us involved in the environmental movement are disappointed that the opportunity to remove the EURATOM treaty, which is an element of the European Union that is a relic from a bygone age, was missed when the draft European constitution was being written. The Green Party has argued that ensuring once and for all that the EURATOM treaty does not have anything to do with the European Union is one of the reasons we need a better constitutional treaty and a better way of organising the Union. It has even been suggested the proposed constitution could insert a sunset clause in the EURATOM treaty if it cannot be removed immediately.</P>
    <P>Our failure to take action in this regard has allowed the Prime Minister of our neighbouring jurisdiction, with which we have had perennial nuclear safety problems, to say the United Kingdom needs to renew and extend its nuclear programme if that country is to comply with greenhouse gas targets and become more environmentally friendly. Ireland could make a better case for its opposition to the United Kingdom&rsquo;s approach if there were no EURATOM treaty, if Ireland were not a party to the treaty or if Ireland were not making a financial contribution as a result of the treaty being in place. Will the Minister of State clarify in his contribution to this debate whether he accepts that we need to address the realities I have mentioned when considering the future of the European Union? Such changes are needed if we are to bring about a better Union.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite or maybe because of what I have heard from Deputies Finian McGrath and Boyle, there has been a greater meeting of minds about the future of the European Union and the discussion on the European constitutional treaty in this debate than there has been in the House for quite some time. I do not doubt that the past 12 months have been quite traumatic and controversial for the European Union and the concept of further enlargement of the Union. Voters in France and the Netherlands rejected the constitutional treaty within days of each other. The sense of uncertainty that resulted from those referendums was compounded by the failure of the June European Council to reach agreement on <Col N="1588"/>the European Union&rsquo;s financial package. It is a great pity that it was not possible to reach such agreement. The uncertainty I have mentioned has been a feature of the UK Presidency. It is extremely unlikely that any significant progress will be made in the areas of budgetary procedure and financial perspectives in the near future.</P>
    <P>I reject the view that the developments to which I have referred constitute a rejection of the European Union. I do not think that is what the Deputies opposite are saying, to be fair. It is time for us to listen to the wake-up call we have been given.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The French did not take the opportunity they were given to make a contribution. I do not doubt that public confidence in the European Union has been damaged. Perhaps it was somewhat premature to try to agree a European constitutional treaty almost in parallel with the assimilation of ten new member states into the Union. Having spent 16 months watching what Deputies Finian McGrath and Boyle and others have described as the European elite trying to get their way, I think there may be some validity in what is being said. While it is true that all the documents, etc. were available on the Internet, I do not think they became bedtime reading for citizens in Ireland or any other member state. While a great deal needs to be done to restore credibility in the European vision, it is still possible to do that. National parliamentarians like the Members of this House have a responsibility to do something to assist that process.</P>
    <P>The European constitutional treaty, as it should be called, has been parked and it is unlikely that it will be resurrected in its current form in the foreseeable future. However, national parliaments should take some aspects of it on board. I was in the Chair last Thursday when Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, who is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, spoke in this Chamber about the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005. Many of the Deputies who spoke about the Bill expressed amazement at the decision-making process that allowed the relevant EU directive or legislation to emanate from Brussels. This Parliament should do something about this.</P>
    <P>The draft constitutional treaty provides that national parliaments should be informed about the origin of directives as soon as possible. We are talking about a six-week period. I do not understand why the Government and its EU partners cannot introduce such a provision at EU <Col N="1589"/>level, separate to the constitutional process. If such a provision were in place, Members would be unable to blame the so-called EU bureaucrats for something they know nothing about.</P>
    <P>I have served with Deputy Allen on the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Some directives were referred to the sub-committee after they had been ratified, which meant that the Oireachtas had no opportunity to examine them. Even when we were able to assess various directives, we did not have a great opportunity to make an input. I do not think the process has improved since then. We should examine this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>It has been proposed on many occasions that we should try to improve the level of understanding of the debate on EU matters by introducing a European week in the Oireachtas. There is huge merit in the concept of debating in the House the wide range of issues which form part of the EU debate. I accept that the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on European Affairs does great work; there is no doubt about that. With the best will in the world, however, the media does not pay any great attention to the work of the sub-committee other than when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy, appear before it. The proposal I have mentioned would represent a way of doing something concrete about the lack of public understanding of EU matters.</P>
    <P>There is a high degree of consciousness of EU matters among certain people in this country. I compliment the work of the National Forum on Europe which cannot be faulted for the level of energy it has shown in its efforts to ensure that people talk about EU issues. Young people from the National Youth Council of Ireland spoke about such issues in Dublin Castle some weeks ago as part of the process. Deputies like Deputy Finian McGrath and I, who come from a teaching background, spend a good deal of our time visiting schools. There is a greater awareness among young people of European issues now than there was. That is because young people travel, European issues are part of the transition year programme and organisations such as European Movement Ireland are able to provide awareness and training programmes on European issues. I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for securing a significantly increased contribution in this year&rsquo;s Estimates for European Movement Ireland. It will make a great different in increasing its capacity to make a serious input into debate on Europe.</P>
    <P>As a small member state, our Presidency of the European Union was, by any standards, superb. The Department of Foreign Affairs officials, our diplomatic staff, the Ministers and the Taoiseach deserve to be complimented. Unfortunately, there has been a serious slowdown in the pace <Col N="1590"/>of progress. Perhaps that was inevitable but it is regrettable that the European Commission President does not always take a proactive role in ensuring that there is ongoing significant and wide-ranging debate on Europe.</P>
    <P>We can talk about the reasons the Lisbon Agenda is beyond the understanding of most people. It is regrettable that when we talk about the Lisbon Agenda, we tend to talk about competitiveness and the influences of globalisation. The other side of that strategy, which is equally important, is the need for us to provide for those who are least able to provide for themselves and to ensure that the jobs of those who have them are protected and that they get better ones. The services directive derailed the debate on Europe throughout mainland Europe to a great extent and that was not addressed. The indications are that Commissioner McCreevy is now at least attempting to draw together the threads of that debate which were unravelling.</P>
    <P>Despite what some people say, ratification of the constitutional treaty would significantly simplify the way that Europe works. In many respects whenever we revisit the question of the constitutional treaty, substantially the same measures will be contained in it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to what Deputy Boyle said about the EURATOM treaty. Lack of progress on it was not for the want of trying. He will recall the work on it done by the Minister, Deputy Roche, and during the Intergovernmental Conference to try to reach consensus on the insertion into it of a sunset clause. I agree with what the Deputy said. We would not be in the lacuna in which we find ourselves if that had been addressed, although with the demise of treaty we would be back to square one as we are in other areas.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the constitutional treaty will require us all to make an input by going around the country and persuading the persuaders that there is great deal in it to be gained by us all. People have referred to the greatly expanded customer base we would have, but I prefer to concentrate on issues such as the western Balkans. Whatever future there is for that part of Europe lies in the European Union being able to engage proactively in settling it down, for want of a better phrase. I do not want to divide further an already very divided part of Europe but I want to try to ensure that it can benefit from the same successes from which the rest of Europe has benefited.</P>
    <P>This has been a useful debate probably more wide-ranging that we have had in a long time. The idea of European week might be explored on an all-party basis perhaps through the Joint Committee on European Affairs or some other mechanism. As a small member state committed to the European ideal, Ireland could significantly advance that idea. It would not be difficult to do that. With the exception of the member state next door which might not take on board such a pro<Col N="1591"/>posal, I believe that otherwise it would be agreed with open arms.</P>

	<P>I am glad the mood in the House is much quieter than it was this time yesterday, and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle is also pleased about this.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to this House three and a half years ago, I took the view, and I ask Members not to hold this against me, that I would probably have a parochial enough view of politics and I would do little other than represent my constituency and its component parts.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am often accused of mentioning Tallaght every chance I get. One of the benefits of being a Member, and I say this genuinely, is the opportunity to mix with colleagues from all parties as a result of which one discovers, as I already knew, that there is a big wide world out there.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>What one is that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>Such exchanges help to formulate one&rsquo;s views and it makes for good politics. I have also particularly enjoyed meeting politicians from other jurisdictions during the past three years. We had the opportunity to meet politicians from Switzerland today.</P>
    <P>All Members have taken the odd opportunity to travel to other countries, observe the way in which other parliaments work and listen to what their politicians have to say. As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, when one travels abroad as a member of a delegation from the Oireachtas, one discovers the great esteem in which Ireland is viewed abroad, particularly in the European Union but also elsewhere. That is something of which we should all be proud.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, will not mind my reminding him of the time we were in Shanghai together and our having a sense of Ireland having a very good image in China. Irish people living there were delighted to meet Irish people who had just travelled there from Ireland and were able to tell them what was happening at home. The image of the country abroad is superb. We should not be ashamed to stress that in a debate such as this.</P>
    <P>I view myself not only as proud to be Irish but proud to be European. I come from a generation <Col N="1592"/>when the war was only over when I was young. People still had ration books and were poor. As I was growing up in the inner city, my family told stories about the war which was only over a few years. I bring to this debate my image of that time. In a world which to some extent has been turned upside down with all the conflicts and wars taking place, much has been learnt by European leaders and European countries during the past 60 years. That is significant and a point to which the Taoiseach has often referred. We should be clear about and proud of that, and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Colleagues will always have political points to make about the development of the European Union and I do not have a problem with that in such a debate. People are entitled to have those views. I am simply telling Members where I am coming from.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about my town of Tallaght in a few minutes because it has benefited greatly from our membership of the European Union, about which I am pleased and proud. I am disappointed the Minister is not here but I know he is under great pressure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We are discussing the EU draft constitutional treaty. Is the Deputy in order in having referred to Tallaght?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I am following the example of others. I listened to the Deputy&rsquo;s contribution and I am following his example. If I was out of line, the Ceann Comhairle would tell me very quickly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>He sure would.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CharlieOConnorFF"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Connor</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that is true. Colleagues have praised the work of the Minister and he has a broad remit. He made a fine contribution on European issues in this debate. I want to make one parochial reference, if I may.</P>
    <P>One of the issues in which I have shown an interest in recent times, which is as much as European as a national issue, is the circumstances of Irish prisoners aboard. I have raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Minister recently. This issue obviously involves other countries, including member states of the European Union. We should be concerned about Irish persons who, for one reason or another, are detained in prisons abroad. I am glad the Minister has taken a particular interest in this subject. He agreed recently to arrange for the carrying out of a research project to identify the number of Irish prisoners abroad and their need for services. He informed the D&aacute;il recently that the terms of reference for that study had been agreed. I single that out for special mention because the study will be carried out by my friend and colleague, Mr. Chris Flood, a former of Minister of State and a person whom I am proud to have succeeded in the D&aacute;il. This is the first opportunity I have had to record my <Col N="1593"/>welcome for that appointment. It is right that we should do this. To keep on the right side of Deputy Finian McGrath, it is very much a European issue and I am sure he will support me in that regard. I would expect our views to be quite compatible.</P>
    <P>I look forward to next Tuesday when we will have an opportunity of meeting the President of Cyprus. I have consistently raised the issue of Cyprus in the House because I have a particular interest in this matter. We all have an opportunity to meet the ambassador on a regular basis, and to meet other Cypriot citizens who inform us of the difficulties. I had an opportunity to visit both sides of the Cyprus divide 20 years ago. I saw for myself how such a division can affect people. It presents particular challenges for the European Union, especially in regard to the accession discussions with Turkey. The Minister of State should understand that this is something that draws a response from representatives on all sides of the House. Like other colleagues, I look forward to welcoming the President of Cyprus next week.</P>
    <P>As other colleagues have said, any debate about the European constitution will obviously deal with European issues. As Deputy Finian McGrath and others have said, that is what happened in France and it will also happen in all the other countries of the European Union, which is fair enough. It is somewhat unfortunate that people would use a debate on the constitutional referendum to respond to politics as they see it, but they are entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to Tallaght. I have often said that I was not born a politician. I am lucky to be a Member of the D&aacute;il and I am delighted about it. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would tell the leader to lay off me and I might get a second term. Tallaght has benefited hugely from Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, as have other towns and counties throughout the country. I am very pleased and proud about this. Those Members who know Tallaght will know that European Union moneys were used in respect of the development of the institute of technology there which is now a tremendous facility that is drawing a great deal of praise not only from around the country but from abroad. Tallaght Hospital was opened seven years ago. Although I am not supposed to say so, the Ceann Comhairle was one of the Ministers involved at the start of the prolonged fight for that hospital who was so helpful to us. I was delighted to get to know him in those times. Europe has helped the third largest population centre in the country, which is Tallaght, in its development, not only with its roads but also in terms of the two institutions to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght person of the year award was held for the 22nd time recently. The guest of honour was the Dublin MEP, Deputy Eoin Ryan. As one would expect, he got a tremendous reception.</P>

	<P>It was late on a Friday evening and even though people invariably wanted to get on with their dinner, dancing and singing &mdash; as people do on these occasions, and Tallaght is no different to anywhere else in the country &mdash; Deputy Eoin Ryan got a very positive and warm response from the ordinary people of Tallaght, including community leaders, to his message about the European constitution and Europe in general.</P>
    <P>It is good that we are having this debate and that counterpoints are being put forward. I am happy to debate those at any time. I appreciate the help the Ceann Comhairle has given me during my contribution.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Is c&uacute;is &aacute;thais dom go bhfuil an deis seo agam freagra a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na D&aacute;la ar an &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach seo, an tAontas Eorpach.</P>
    <P>Just over a month ago I had the privilege of participating in a Seanad debate following the publication of the White Paper on the European Constitution, which is part of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in an EU-wide period of reflection and national debate. That day I was struck by the depth of commitment and knowledge exhibited by Members of the Seanad. Today, it is clear that the same situation also applies in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>It is evident from today&rsquo;s statements that there are differences among us. Some of these relate to macro issues such as the appropriate level of European integration while other concerns are more specific relating, for example, to particular economic or foreign and security policy issues. It is obvious too that there is one thing on which we all agree, whether we are pro-European Union, anti-European Union or somewhere in between. It is simply this: Europe really matters. It matters to every single person in Ireland, throughout the European Union, in our neighbouring countries and across the globe where many people view the European Union as a source of support and inspiration. Europe matters because every day brings new decisions and actions at a European level that impact positively on the lives of citizens and communities throughout Ireland and the European Union.</P>
    <P>It has been said that although the European Union is critically important, we appear to only <Col N="1595"/>take it seriously when a crisis or a problem emerges and grabs our attention. The European Union makes the front pages when talks collapse, rows break out, or a national government has what is always described as a &ldquo;dispute with Brussels&rdquo;. It is no wonder awareness levels are often low, while cynicism is frequently all too high.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, my top priority is to raise awareness and communicate &ldquo;with&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;to&rdquo; the Irish people about what our membership of the European Union is doing for them. So much in our daily lives is better, thanks to the many measures agreed at a European level. A few tangible examples are lower telephone bills due to increased competition, compensation rights for delayed or cancelled air flights, food safety, environmental protection measures, free-to-air sporting events and free ATM withdrawals across the eurozone. This is not to mention the invaluable external work of the European Union around the world in the fields of foreign policy, trade and development, as outlined by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, earlier today.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of policies that cause people to say it is good that this is being done. They should give the people confidence in their legislators here in Ireland and in Europe. All of these policies have been negotiated in EU Councils by Irish Ministers and in the European Parliament by Irish MEPs. A record of up to 80 pieces of EU legislation was steered through under Irish leadership during our EU Presidency last year, most of them directly related to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of sustainable growth leading to a more dynamic and competitive Europe.</P>
    <P>As I stated, Europe matters. It is without question a force for good in our daily lives and one of the key catalysts behind this country&rsquo;s transformation in recent decades. However, one cannot be blind to the challenges ahead. I have already mentioned the first challenge, namely building and maintaining awareness, confidence and engagement on the part of our citizens. Already, our EU colleagues look to Ireland as an example to follow in this area, with our successful introduction of parliamentary scrutiny and the excellent work of Senator Maurice Hayes and the National Forum on Europe that operates throughout the country. The Communicating Europe initiative continues to develop with recent projects, including the provision of assistance to the National Adult Literacy Agency for the production of Know your EU learning materials.</P>
    <P>With the publication of the White Paper on the European constitution, the citizens of this country have an opportunity to become more familiar with the EU constitution&rsquo;s provisions. I hope they will do so. On this and on EU issues in general, <Col N="1596"/>I appeal to those of us involved in political life, Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities, to inform and engage with all of the people who elected us to represent them.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the Seanad, we need to foster greater awareness of the European Union in schools, third level institutions, business organisations, voluntary bodies and political movements. Another challenge for the European Union as a whole is the need to take tough, courageous decisions on the big issues facing the Union in the short to medium term. As the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, have outlined, one such decision will be on the financial perspectives for the period 2007-13. As has been mentioned, we will work for the best possible outcome for Ireland and for the European Union as a whole. I sincerely hope the Government will be in a position to report to this House next month that final agreement has been reached at the December European Council. That is our goal and our wish.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The enlarged European Union needs a deal now. This is of particular interest to the new member states which rely on cohesion funding to help drive their individual domestic economies forward. This point was brought home to me at many meetings of the cohesion countries where I represented Ireland, to underline our continuing commitment to the principles of economic solidarity which lie at the heart of the European Union. These include the protection, preservation and sustainability of the Common Agricultural Policy which is a real policy pillar of the European Union and will be critical to its farmers and our farmers in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The European Union and its member states have many challenges, some ongoing, some immediate. Our job as legislators is to represent our country and secure the best outcome possible. On behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this important debate on the European Union in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>

   <Title>Estimates for Public Services 2006: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann commends the 2006 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 17 November 2005.</P>
    <P Just="Right" el="0">&mdash;(Minister for Finance).<?oasys _is0p10- ?></P>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>We will return for a dose of reality to what actually happens in constituencies across Ireland. Last night, I stated that the most regretful issue about the organisation of health services was that the Progressive Democrats is involved in privatising everything, from family doctor services to home help services and public hospital campuses, and that Fianna F&aacute;il is either <Col N="1597"/>inept or complicit in the long-term damage being done to the delivery of health services.</P>
    <P>Supersizing the present inefficient and uncompetitive public private system is of no benefit to either the patients or the taxpayer. A competitive private health care system is one that stands alone and is as independent as possible from the public health care system. The Government is making a fatal mistake by privatising public hospitals. I am surprised that civil servants in the Departments of Finance and Health and Children do not voice their concerns on this issue to members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Waste and a failure to deliver is the continuing mantra of the Government and the Estimates bear this out. Failure to spend &euro;50 million of capital projects funding last year is amazing given the number of TDs awaiting extensions to local hospitals and funding from central Government for community care projects. It is amazing that &euro;50 million, or 10% of the capital budget, went back to the Department this year.</P>
    <P>I would like departmental officials to explain a line in page 83 of the Estimates, which states, &ldquo;The year-on-year increase in gross current health spending is 9% when account is taken of once-off monies provided in 2005, mainly related to the establishment of the Health Service Executive as a Vote&rdquo;. If we examine this figure, it is quite clear the increase in the health budget was 7%. If the HSE was not established in 2005, we are told it would have been 9%.</P>
    <P>Does this mean it cost approximately &euro;200 million to establish the HSE during 2005? That sounds like a fantastic sum of money for the establishment of the HSE, particularly when one considers the fees paid to consultants on PPARS and other computer systems. At least that &euro;50 million was spread over a couple of years. If it is true, I would like the Department to clarify that figure. Perhaps I am reading the report incorrectly.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the Estimates that the Government is big on rhetoric but small on delivery, particularly when it comes to care of the elderly, mental health issues and cancer patients. The debate held during the past 12 months on the stress and pain to elderly patients and their families caused by the distressing revelations about nursing home abuses seems to have been missed by the Government in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach promised that a social services inspectorate would be a priority in 2005. He now tells us it will be a priority in 2006, but I have my doubts. The same empty promises were made with regard to BreastCheck and they have also been exposed in the Estimates. These two services, with the Mental Health Commission and 16 other statutory bodies, are expected to deliver the promises made by the Government with an increase of only &euro;3 million in their budgets. If that is achieved we will not have seen such a feat since the days of the loaves and fishes.</P><Col N="1598"/>
    <P>It is impossible to deliver BreastCheck, Mental Health Commission work, the social services inspectorate, with all that needs to be done, and the other 16 statutory bodies with only &euro;3 million extra in the budget. I would like that explained more clearly. Perhaps it will come on budget day. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may think he is a messiah but the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, certainly is not. She is a mere mortal and it sounds ridiculous that she will deliver those Estimates on that much funding.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the health Estimates I find strange and which shows that the privatisation agenda in Government policy is taking over our health services completely is the massive increase in funding to the National Treatment Purchase Fund. This contains a significant anomaly and I am surprised Fianna F&aacute;il TDs, who proclaim to be socialist minded or equality minded, are going along with this stunt. The National Treatment Purchase Fund has been exposed as a bit of a fraud. The Minister of State should examine the figures. We would not consider paying any other public servants on the double in the same way as we pay consultants under the National Treatment Purchase Fund. It was exposed recently by the Comptroller and Auditor General that consultants are paid twice to do half the work on that fund. Half of the work done so far for the fund has been done in public hospitals. In one third of the cases, the work on public patients was carried out in the same hospital where that patient is on the waiting list for an operation. That is a scandalous way to use taxpayers&rsquo; money. The Government should be exposed on that issue. It is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this issue a few months ago, I made the following comparison: if GPs told the Minister for Health and Children that they were too busy to see their medical card patients, and the Minister came up with a scheme to allow doctors in private practice to see those medical card patients for a fee, and a review of the scheme three years later found that medical card doctors who were previously too busy to see those patients now saw half of them, there would be uproar about the waste of taxpayer&rsquo;s money in allowing such a system to develop. The Progressive Democrats, particularly the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, holds this up as the great example of how we should run our health services when it is the most ridiculous public private partnership I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>The Government&rsquo;s attempts to put private hospitals on the grounds of public hospitals gives us an idea of the road it is going down. It is supersizing the same nonsensical and uncompetitive private medicine and tagging it on to an inefficient public health system. We are going down the road to ruin on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Estimates do not tell us much more, other than that there is no great commitment to health services in this year&rsquo;s budget. We are returning to <Col N="1599"/>the days of 2001 when the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, stated that funding is for the delivery of the same level of services as the previous year. All these Estimates show is the same level of delivery next year as we saw for the past four or five years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should read on. He has taken Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s words out of context. He has not read the full quote. Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s quotation was much longer.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>He mentioned the same level of services when he wrote to every health board from 2001 until he left office. It is obvious reading the HSE report that it states the same. The HSE report was published in April 2005 and uses the same words on delivering the same level of service as was delivered in the previous year. The Estimates contain a 7% increase on the previous year&rsquo;s budget and issues will arise during the year that will reduce funding for other issues. The promises made in 2005 have not been delivered. Any delivery worth talking about on the ten-point plan has not been included. Only a handful of doctor-only medical cards have been issued and we have almost reached the end of 2005. The T&aacute;naiste tried to blame the GPs for this. She was responsible for the 30,000 full medical cards that she could have delivered in 2005 and only 1,000 of those cards have been delivered.</P>
    <P>We went through a charade last year, not just on the Estimates but also on the budget, about all the extra money to be invested in doctor-only medical cards, ten-point plans for accident and emergency units and other aspects of the health services. Much of this money was not spent during 2005, certainly not in the health service. This charade needs to stop and we must increase accountability and transparency of health spending. Money is not channelled to where it is supposed to be spent. I wish to have answers to the questions I raised.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to contribute to this important debate on the Government&rsquo;s spending blueprint for the forthcoming year. For eight successive years the Government, led by Fianna F&aacute;il, has steered the country through the brightest years the nation has enjoyed since independence. By pursuing prudent management of our economy, built on low taxes, and extensive investment in public services and infrastructure, the Government has created the conditions whereby Ireland is a leading economy in the European Union and globally recognised as such. As we enter the second half of the first decade of the 21st century, we have succeeded in bringing Ireland up from its knees. Instead of following, it sets the pace for others. I encounter this in my role as Minister of <Col N="1600"/>State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs. Colleagues and officials across Europe ask constantly how we managed this and how we survived the most serious economic downturn of recent times when their economies are stagnating.</P>
    <P>Even the most pessimistic economic commentators recognise that Ireland Inc. is in a strong position and that all relevant indicators are pointing in the right direction. The Deputies opposite continue to do what the Opposition does, namely, throw cold and sometimes dirty water on our many achievements. These earnest pronouncements ring hollow when one looks at their record and hears the increasingly confused messages emanating from prospective rainbow alliance parties that are at sixes and sevens on taxation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Not at all, that is rubbish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I would never argue we have delivered a utopian society or that all inequalities have been eliminated. As a Member of this House for 23 years I admit more progress must be made in a range of areas. Our country is a fairer, better, more prosperous place for more of our people than ever before. These Estimates, with the fiscal provisions of the forthcoming budget, will ensure we do not deviate from the course we are on, which will deliver growth rates of 5% next year, more than twice the European average.</P>
    <P>Next year the Government will spend &euro;48.5 billion on running the country. This is approximately &euro;3 billion more than last year and will allow for an extensive additional injection of investment in public services. Fianna F&aacute;il has always been a socially inclusive party and our republican philosophy dictates that the fruits of our economic prosperity be spread as evenly as possible all over the country. The focus of these Estimates show we are firmly wedded to this course. Priority is being given to key areas of social impact, namely, health, education and social welfare. Nearly &euro;2 billion, or 70%, of the additional moneys will be spent on these three areas.</P>
    <P>Lest we be in any doubt on our consistency in promoting social inclusion over the past seven years, the following facts are worth restating. We successfully introduced the highest minimum wage in Europe, over 90% of which is tax free. Since 1997, almost 420,000 people have been removed altogether from the tax net. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in the EU with long-term unemployment cut by 80%. There are almost 400,000 people at work in this country. We doubled social welfare spending, delivering the most generous social welfare improvements since the establishment of the welfare state. Child benefit trebled and old age pensions increased by almost 60%.</P>
    <P>Understandably, the Deputies opposite will gloss over these facts as they attempt to mislead and misinterpret. When the two main parties of <Col N="1601"/>the rainbow were last in government, namely, Fine Gael and Labour, they insulted our senior citizens with a paltry &euro;1.60 increase in old age pensions. If we looked at history books we could dig much deeper. What a disastrous way our pensioners were treated under those desperate people.</P>

	<P>The memory of massive dole queues, rampant inflation and a criminal level of emigration still sends a shiver down the spine. This is a painful legacy of the parties opposite and it took Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s return to Government in 1987, and the initiation of the social partnership model, which Fine Gael opposed, under the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to set us on the course we are following for the exciting years ahead.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for sharing time. I wish to discuss a number of issues on the Estimates, namely, education and agriculture. The Estimate for the Department of Education and Science has increased to &euro;7.2 billion for the first time. This is to be spent on projects throughout the country and in the next two years 500 extra teachers will be employed in primary schools to tackle disadvantage and reduce class size. Class size will be significantly reduced in the coming years, a welcome measure. Reports on disadvantage have shown that money on primary schools is well spent and I welcome the initiative by the Minister to allocate additional teachers.</P>
    <P>The provision of schools and classroom extensions are to the forefront of every public representative in any elected body. Politicians are often brought to meetings to discuss such issues. I compliment the Department on the devolved <Col N="1602"/>grants, following the pilot scheme that allowed smaller schools to apply for such a grant and spend it in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>The pilot scheme of 2003 involved 20 schools and a value for money audit for this scheme would show it to be superior to the old scheme. Local boards of management have achieved considerable value for money. One such project was opened in my home village of Kiskeam. The board of management is also able to raise further funding to complete extra work if it sees fit. The most important issue is the value for money achieved and I compliment the Government on this. This scheme is being rolled out for other, larger schools and this is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Vote of the Department of Agriculture and Food. I compliment the Government on the 10% increase in the Vote. Funding for the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, increased from &euro;271 million in 2005 to &euro;323 million this year. This scheme has had a major impact on the visual environment throughout rural Ireland. This is a fantastic scheme, on which I compliment the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The farm waste management schemes have been increased and further moneys have been invested. This is very welcome. I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative to extend the availability of the farm waste management schemes to a wider variety of farmers and increase the grant allocation in certain instances. This is vital, particularly in light of the nitrates directive which is coming on stream from Europe. It is excellent to see the schemes being expanded.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of &euro;6.9 million for the compensation allowances paid to farmers in certain disadvantaged areas and I commend the Book of Estimates to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Book of Estimates and wish to focus on the area of education and science. There has been a triumph of spin over substance in the announcements last week by the Minister for Education and Science concerning the Book of Estimates. I do not see anything in the Estimates that will make a major difference to young people in the education system.</P>
    <P>The area that received the most attention was the appointment of an extra 500 teachers which is supposed address the problem of class size. Class sizes in Irish schools are at the very upper end of the scale in comparison with other European countries. We have more than 100,000 pupils in primary schools and more than 35,000 in secondary schools in classes of more than 30. The Minister announced 500 extra teachers over two years. I think 300 will be employed this year and 200 next year. Even if it is 250 in each year, whatever way one looks at this, as there are more than 3,000 primary schools, an extra 200 or 300 teachers this year will not cut class sizes in the majority of those primary schools no matter what way those posts are allocated.</P><Col N="1603"/>
    <P>The programme for Government, with which the Minister of State is very familiar, promises that the Government will bring class sizes down to European norms and general international standards. It specifically states that all children under nine should be in classes with a ratio of 20:1 or less. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, immediately said when she came into office that it was a noble aspiration that would not be achieved. That in itself is a broken promise to the people and a failure of the commitment in the programme for Government. I do not see how these extra teachers are going to make very much difference or even put a dent in the problem. That is the first disappointment.</P>
    <P>I am also very disappointed that the National Educational Welfare Board is only getting an increase of 4%. Anybody in this House who watched the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night will have seen the difficulties faced by the board. Its chief executive officer, who was on television last night, said that the board could only deal with crisis situations with regard to truancy and that it does not have the staff or resources to address the problem of children dropping out of school. Surely, if there is any vulnerable group in society, it must be young people who do not attend school regularly. The National Educational Welfare Board does not have the resources necessary to deal with the issue and its CEO said so quite plainly on television last night. It only has 73 educational welfare officers working locally but needs more than double that number to be able to address the problem.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent days about dealing with crime but if we do not catch young people at the point when they drop out of school or do not attend school, what hope do we have of leading them to any other path in life except a negative one? We have the opportunity to lead them down another path but it has not been taken. I urge the Government to provide more money in the budget for the National Educational Welfare Board because it has not been provided in the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The area of youth work is related. I met a representative of the National Youth Council of Ireland yesterday. The council is extremely disappointed in the increase of 2.5% to the youth work budget, which is a very low increase. The council was optimistic last year because it received an extra &euro;5.5 million but I understand not all of that money has been spent because the necessary decisions have not been made by Government on the implementation of the Youth Work Act. However, the council had hoped that the positive start would be built on, that the money allocated for 2005 would be spent and that further moneys would be available. This would have signalled a real commitment to youth work which, through an enormous number of volunteers, is dealing with the problem of young people who need support. It deals in a positive way with young people <Col N="1604"/>rather than the negative approach that comes later in the juvenile justice system if young people are not given the help they need. I am very disappointed that the youth work budget was not increased by more than 2.5%.</P>
    <P>Another area of disappointment is the failure to implement the McIvor report on post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses which afford further educational opportunities to young people who do not attend institutes of technology or universities. The report recommended a structure to support the PLC sector and the money involved was &euro;50 million for this year. None of this has happened. There is great disappointment because we are talking about people who are not in the top echelons, who are not going to be in the feeder schools listed in newspapers in recent days, but who want to go on and develop. The opportunities in the PLC sector often relate directly to the workplace. The courses give people opportunities to study subjects that will lead directly to a job after a one or two-year course. The subjects, by and large, are very practical. That sector needs to be built up and supported but, again, that opportunity has not been taken.</P>
    <P>There is an evident lack of imagination in and support for those areas in the education sector for people who are not the high achievers, do not have the advantages others have and who need extra support from the Department of Education and Science. Those areas have not received support in these Estimates.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the area of disadvantage and the promise that the DEIS system would be introduced next year, which was supposed to address educational disadvantage and for which there was supposed to be a budget of an extra &euro;40 million. However, I questioned officials from the Department at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and it appears that &euro;40 million will not be available next year or the year after, rather there will be a gradual introduction of funding. Again, we are talking about children who need help now and for whom a little assistance in the early years of their school lives would make an enormous difference to their futures.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Costello, and I raised a related issue during an Adjournment debate last week. A number of schools in disadvantaged areas, especially small schools, have lost resource teachers as a result of the introduction of the weighted model for the most common special educational needs areas. I urge the Government to address the issue of those schools, a number of which are in my city and also in Dublin, that have lost resources. These are the most needy schools with a proven need for educational support for resource teaching and they are losing out.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to a statistic in the Book of Estimates which surprised me, namely, the reduction of 34% in special needs support for second level schools. I do not understand why that is the case in the current climate, especially after the implementation of the Education for <Col N="1605"/>Persons with Special Educational Needs Act which surely should have meant a need for more special needs support rather than less. That is a statistic in the Book of Estimates that I find hard to believe. It is listed under subhead D.12, special needs assistants &mdash; second level, and there is a reduction of 34% in the allocation.</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas I would tackle if I were in government. I take issue with what the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said about the rainbow Government, which handed over a surplus, in terms of money in the coffers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Handed over what?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>A surplus. After the rainbow Government we had a very healthy economic balance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to go back again and check my statement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I were in a rainbow Government now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The debt would double.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I were in a rainbow Government now, I would concentrate on the areas that have been omitted in these Estimates by the Department of Education and Science. In some schools up to 50% of pupils have literacy problems. I cannot see anything in the Book of Estimates that will address their problems. It will make no difference to the children who need a service most. With the budget approaching there is still time to focus on those areas of disadvantage to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The percentage of GDP spent on education in Ireland puts us at the bottom of the class in EU or OECD terms. In particular, expenditure on primary and secondary education since 1997 has dropped from 4.7% to 4.1% of our national wealth. That is an indication that education has moved down the list of priorities for the Government when it should be going up because every cent spent on it delivers positive results for society and the economy. At a time when we have so much money there is an onus on the Government to invest resources in the education sector to give all citizens opportunities. According to the Lisbon Agenda, the economy needs a large number of additional skilled workers. Therefore, it is not so much a question of social equality as economic need. It is disappointing that education is not given the treatment it deserves in these times of plenty.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in the annual Estimates debate. The capital envelope for the Department of Transport is now framed by Transport 21 which will be rolled out in the next few years. The Estimate was agreed before <Col N="1606"/>Transport 21 was finalised and capital spending plans in the next few years will become evident when the five-year rolling capital programmes are announced by the Minister for Finance. The net Estimate of &euro;2.18 billion is &euro;15 million or 1% above the 2005 Estimate. The increase is due to an increase in current expenditure from &euro;409 million in 2005 to &euro;425 million in 2006.</P>
    <P>The main capital expenditure items in 2006 will comprise a provision of &euro;1.3 billion for the national roads programme which will see the commencement of work on 11 projects totalling 291 km. Among the projects to start will be the N3 &mdash; Clonee to Kells bypass, phase 2 of the M50 upgrade, the Waterford city bypass and phase 2 of the N6 &mdash; Kinnegad to Athlone. Next year will also see the completion of work on 14 projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, the Naas Road upgrade and bypasses of Ashbourne, Cavan, Mullingar, Bundoran-Ballyshannon and Monaghan, as well as ongoing work on ten projects, including the N1 &mdash; Border to Dundalk, and the Ennis and Arklow-Gorey bypasses.</P>
    <P>An amount of &euro;435 million, an increase of 2% over 2005, has been allocated for implementation of the public transport investment programme which is part of Transport 21 and will provide the financial support needed to enable construction to begin in 2006 on the Luas extension to Cherrywood, on which I received the papers to appoint an inspector in the past week; the Kildare route four-tracking which will have a huge impact on our ability to electrify and create DART systems from the southside into the city centre; the new docklands rail station; the Cork commuter services development and the Portlaoise train care depot. In addition, planning and design work will be advanced on the DART line resignalling, phase 1 of the rail line to Navan as far as Dunboyne, phase 1 of the western rail corridor from Ennis to Athenry, the Luas docklands extension, the Luas cross-city link, the Luas Citywest extension and the metro.</P>
    <P>I have made provision in the Estimates for the continued funding of the rural transport initiative, which is important for Deputies on all sides of the House. This service provides public transport services for people living in rural areas who otherwise would not have access to transport. A sum of &euro;5 million has been set aside for this project in 2006 which will bring the overall funding commitment to more than &euro;18 million to the end of 2006, which compares favourably with the total of &euro;4.4 million provided for the rural transport initiative in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>In advance of completion of the Dublin Bus network review which is due early in 2006, the House will be aware that I recently approved a request from the company for funding for 20 buses before the end of this year. This will provide an immediate injection of additional capacity for bus services in Dublin. Funding for 20 additional buses in Dublin is only the first element in the expansion of bus services. Officials <Col N="1607"/>of my Department have been in discussions with the bus companies and further meetings are planned in the coming weeks to discuss the further expansion of bus services in Dublin and provincial areas. I am committed to the continued development of quality bus corridors in Dublin and funding for these projects will continue in 2006, with funding for the bus priority measures in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to the comprehensive development of public transport services which are accessible to those with mobility impairments and has increased the 2006 allocation to &euro;15 million from the &euro;10 million provided in 2005. I have allocated &euro;7 million to fund the move of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety. The MBRS is transferring from the Earlsfort Terrace campus of UCD, with the faculty of medicine and the academic section of the department of forensic medicine, to Belfield.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimate of &euro;425 million for net non-capital expenditure is 4% higher than the 2005 Estimate of &euro;410 million. Among the main non-capital expenditure items in 2006 will be an amount of &euro;299 million allocated for public service provision payments, up 5% on 2005. This will allow the continued support by my Department of transport companies in respect of their provision of socially necessary but non-commercial transport services. This sum also provides that, in addition to the 5% increase in public service payments to Dublin Bus for 2006, a further &euro;1.7 million will be allocated to the company to meet the operational costs of the 20 additional buses to which I referred.</P>
    <P>There is much more but all the detail is included in Transport 21. Many projects are under way, at various levels of planning and design, under construction or subject to planning. We will maintain a full focus on them in the years ahead.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for allowing me to share time to make some brief comments. In his presence I welcome the Luas extension to Cherrywood, a huge infrastructural development for a part of my constituency. It is to be commended as an example of proper infrastructural development in that the proposal will be put in advance of a major area plan in which residential units will be developed with other developments. I hope the DART signalling work will be an unobtrusive exercise, unlike the most recent upgrades.</P>
    <P>The comments from Opposition parties are based largely on a perception of incorrect procedure. They suggest the Estimates, budget and Finance Bill should be amalgamated into one event. I can understand the reason they want this because successive Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments have had nothing but good news to share with the people on budget day in terms of what is contained in the Estimates and the Finance Bill. It <Col N="1608"/>must be galling for members of the Opposition to have to witness this and they must be envious. I am amazed they make the argument because it shows that the absence of anything substantial to attack in the Estimates forces them to resort to claims of incorrect procedure.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will thank us in 18 months&rsquo; time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>If they ever form an alternative Government, which would amaze me given the lack of coherence in what they say, they will be only too happy to continue with the process if they had had the success with the economy we have had in the past eight years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a meaningful process in 18 months&rsquo; time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>How we make these announcements will not make much difference because it will get into the public ether that the Government is successful and the economy is buoyant. These are the basics. We cannot get away from them. The economy is buoyant and we are concentrating spending in the key social areas such as health, education and social welfare, in which I am sure the Labour Party has a tradition and policy. Envy will be a destructive force if it is allowed to take over. The Government has done a great deal in these areas.</P>
    <P>In regard to health, it begins as a soundbite and becomes a policy to try to drill it into the public mind that there is a huge number of administrative staff employed in the health service. Eventually it becomes a clich&eacute; to which people are sick and tired of listening. It is a clich&eacute; that only frontline staff are working and the 35,000 additional staff in the health service are in their offices listening to Joe Duffy on the radio, reading the newspapers, drinking coffee and not doing very much. This is the current clich&eacute; but the public are discerning enough to be able to distinguish the rubbish from the facts. These people are working hard. Frontline staff cannot deliver services without proper back-up, to which the Government is committed.</P>
    <P>One need only examine the expansions in the medical card scheme in recent years. Millions of Irish people will benefit from this generosity. The Minister for Health and Children recently announced a 20% increase in the provision of medical cards. Last year, when a GP only scheme was announced, Deputy Rabbitte amusingly referred to them as yellow-pack. I can only compare it to his role in Cabinet when he was a yellow-pack Minister. Perhaps this is what he was thinking about.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a cheap shot. Has the Government delivered on what it promised?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1609"/>
   <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We have delivered on what we promised. The programme for Government is delivered substantially. The Opposition is painting itself into a corner, because the more we achieve in regard to the programme for Government, the less ground it has to stand on, which must be very frustrating.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of issues but I will conclude. I commend the Book of Estimates to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Murphy and Deputy Cuffe.</P>
    <P>Listening to the previous speaker, one would think that the Government was trying to deliver on some of the issues. We were promised 200,000 medical cards, 2,000 garda&iacute; and social housing, which has gone by the wayside. What is the farce this evening all about? I understood the Estimates were about allocating sufficient funding to provide essential services for a host of issues such as health, housing, foreign aid, infrastructure and so on. Is this happening? If essential services are what the Estimates are about &mdash; the budget will be delivered in a few days&rsquo; time &mdash; why are people in the Dundalk area fund-raising to buy essential equipment, such as a CT scanner, for their local hospital? Even though these people are already compliant taxpayers and have met all their obligations, they must raise money to pay for essential equipment.</P>
    <P>What is the economic sense in hundreds of people being transferred annually between Dundalk hospital and Drogheda hospital at a cost of between &euro;800 to &euro;1,000 a time? We hear about the provision of essential services but there is no sign of them. The people who require a CT scanner are seriously ill. A broken arm or a broken leg is serious, but an ordinary straightforward X-ray will suffice in these cases. It is only people who are very ill who need the facility of a CT scanner, but these people are being transferred at huge cost. Some patients are so ill that they cannot be transported. They must lie on their hospital bed or trolley in the corridor hoping they will become sufficiently strong to be transported to the excellent hospital in Drogheda to avail of a CT scanner. Is this what Members mean when they say the Opposition is jealous of the excellent services the Government is providing? They can try to convince the Opposition, but the public have copped on to the Government and it will get the message sooner rather than later. The provision of essential services is not happening. The T&aacute;naiste is telling us that the health budget is increasing by X amount, but we have not heard by how much. However, the public will be the final arbitrators in the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Book of Estimates indicates increases in spending, it also brings heightened expectations for increased public services, which the public has a right to expect. Ministers have damped down expectations, <Col N="1610"/>particularly in the area of child care. One must remember that the elevation of the issue was not about party political hype or media hype, it happened at a time when the public had political clout, which was during the election campaign. The issue was raised during the Kildare and north Meath by-elections.</P>
    <P>Areas like mine are often described as a commuter belt. It suggests that there are some sort of economic drones living in these areas, who commute between work and home, pick up their children and have two hours of quality time. However, the reality is very different. Those who raised the child care issue so forcefully during the election campaign saw themselves as working parents who exist in communities with significant shortcomings. There are shortcomings in affordable and available child care services. There are shortcomings also in community facilities that allow them to make the links for after school recreation, getting children to and from school safely and the cost and provision of pre-school services which are all part of the same child care debate. There should be some provision for these services in the budget for people who are paying the equivalent of a second mortgage each month. I accept there is a need to deal with the child care strategy over several budgets. I expect some provision to be made in the budget towards the cost of child care. However, the strategy to deal comprehensively with the issue must be outlined at the same time.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight two issues. This includes the local government fund where there is a serious inequity, particularly in developing areas where there are significant increases in the population. Additional funds are not being provided to compensate for this increase. Purchasing water, augmenting the sewage treatment plant and benchmarking accounted for the increase paid to Kildare County Council last year, with no funding for discretionary spending, which is not fair. The mid-east region has drawn up a report on the matter.</P>
    <P>The second issue to which I refer is special educational needs and the psychological services. There is no evidence in the Book of Estimates that there will be a sizeable increase in this area. I tabled a parliamentary question recently on the number of court cases taken by parents seeking education for their children and the costs involved. Some &euro;10 million over two years was expended on legal costs. While this money should have been spent on the services, parents had no choice but to take this course of action to secure these services, which is bad all round.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome many of the improvements that have taken place in the programme for Government. I welcome the confidence, vibrancy and can-do attitude in modern Ireland, which did not all come from Fianna F&aacute;il. It is important to welcome the vibrancy and the aspects that came from the Government. I object, however, to the <Col N="1611"/>development of a two-tier Ireland where success is for the chosen few and if a person does not have the resources to succeed, the Government will not provide them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Luas lines that have been opened. The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Brennan, first commissioned a study of the issue in 1988 and Fianna F&aacute;il put up billboards in the 1991 local elections promising light rail for Dublin but it took a further 14 years to deliver on the promise. I take with a pinch of salt the promise that the Government will build a rail line between here and Navan by the next general election and that the Luas will be running to Shankill-Cherrywood and beyond a couple of years afterwards. I see no strong commitment to public transport on the part of the Minister relative to the amount of motorway he has built. He is throwing motorways about like snuff at a wake while public transport gets the crumbs from the transport table, about 20% of capital funding. Greater funding should be provided for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Deputy say that? A sum of &euro;16 billion was invested in public transport. It is time to come up with a better tune as the old one is becoming pathetic.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Dubliners do not have access to the Luas lines and even if they do, they get stuck in either Connolly Station or at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green because the lines do not join. That comes down to the Minister&rsquo;s own difficulties in making a commitment to improve public transport.</P>
    <P>There is a two-tier system in health care. In D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is all very well for someone who can afford to attend the Blackrock Clinic &mdash; many can &mdash; but if someone has to go to Loughlinstown Hospital, he or she knows it has the worst record in hygiene in the country.</P>
    <P>Standards differ depending on a person&rsquo;s ability to access better health, education or other services. In education, it is fine if someone can afford to attend a fee paying school but attendance at a public school where the pupil-teacher ratio is nowhere near those promised in the programme for Government does not bode well for future prospects. Child care is grand for those who have the time and resources to head off into the tent at the Galway races but a lone parent trying to raise children is stuck in a poverty trap from which there is no way out.</P>
    <P>There is a confidence about modern Ireland but there is also a danger of a two-tier society developing where the haves are doing well but those who cannot get on to the first rung of the ladder are consigned to poverty that is almost impossible to overcome.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Estimates for 2006 which see a sig<Col N="1612"/>nificant increase in Government spending of &euro;3 billion, an increase of 6.6% on the spend for 2005.</P>
    <P>Our public finances are sound and our debt to GDP ratio stands at 29%, down from over 60% back in 1997. The savings in interest payments led to the increased spending. We have radically reduced personal, business and capital taxes, while unemployment has fallen significantly. These are the key factors behind the economy that allow the Minister for Finance to increase the amount he spends. The increase of 6.6% is significantly ahead of the rate of inflation. There has been an increase of 9% for the Department of Health and Children, 8% for the Department of Health and Education, while next year the Department of Social and Family Affairs will receive &euro;12.4 billion. In the period from 1999 to 2006 the social welfare budget has doubled.</P>
    <P>In my area I welcome the upgrade works on the M50 that are due to start imminently, particularly the removal of what has been the greatest problem of all in my lifetime, the Red Cow roundabout. Some of the work already under way is due for completion next year, particularly the Naas Road widening scheme.</P>
    <P>I have heard numerous people say a 9% increase in the Department of Health and Children will do nothing. That is not true; it is a huge increase, three times the rate of inflation and more than the rate of economic growth, meaning real spending growth. The OECD recently confirmed that Irish spending on health had gone from 15% below the OECD average in 1997 to over 17% above in 2003. This is a real increase. I do not take it lightly; I recognise there are delays and problems in particular areas but the number of procedures carried out year on year is increasing and that is where the extra expenditure is going. Other speakers have said the Estimates have added nothing extra but that is simply not true. There have been no cuts in services in any Department, while the 6.6% increase adds significantly to the range of services.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform mentioned that he had 14 key elements to the new nationwide policing programme. There seems to be a lack of belief that the additional 2,000 garda&iacute; promised in the programme for Government will be delivered but it is happening as we speak. There are twice as many recruits in Templemore as there were two years ago. Garda&iacute; cannot be created overnight but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is well on target to reach the 2,000 extra members in 2007. The sooner that is realised the better.</P>

	<P>The Book of Estimates specifically mentions Garda overtime, the figure for which has been increased by &euro;23 million. At a time when the Garda is effectively tackling crime, this overtime budget is absolutely necessary, partic<Col N="1613"/>ularly in Operation Anvil. I have heard Opposition Members say crime is out of control, failing to recognise the success of the Garda. Referring specifically to Operation Anvil, to date the Garda has taken 210 firearms from the streets of Dublin, seized 2,350 vehicles, arrested seven people for murder, 163 people for robbery and 421 for burglary, in addition to 5,000 drug seizures during the operation. Operation Anvil has been and continues to be successful in Dublin and the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to additional overtime funding is crucial to this continued success. His announcement of a gun amnesty and mandatory sentencing are important developments.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Book of Estimates and compliment the Government on prudent management of our economic affairs since 1997. The polices pursued by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, and the present Minister, Deputy Cowen, have created a situation where the confidence displayed is even recognised by Deputy Cuffe. He says the Government did not create that confidence but he certainly did not create it. Regardless of what coalition the Green Party would enter, it would not create any confidence in any sector of the economy. The policies pursued by the Government have transformed the State and led to the creation of an environment in which people can better themselves and entrepreneurs can set up businesses to compete in world markets, for which the Government should be complimented. The tax take has been considerable and made a valuable contribution to the development of the economy, thus <Col N="1614"/>enabling the Government to provide increases across Departments in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The health budget of &euro;12 billion is deserved and the 9% increase next year will go a long way to ensuring Professor Drumm and the HSE will implement a large measure of Government policy, thereby making sure services are delivered in a more efficient and expansive way. I am glad the education budget will increase by 7.9% to &euro;7.2 billion. The social welfare budget comprises a significant element of Government spending and next year&rsquo;s increase will ensure those who are marginalised and less well off will benefit from the Estimates and the budget.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs should build in a bias into its spending in favour of the elderly who should be given significant increases, while packages for their care should be broadened. In addition, the bureaucracy associated with schemes such as the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and housing aid for the elderly should be abolished. Fast, efficient delivery of services is required for the elderly to ensure those who are sick and cared for at home can have their lot improved immediately. The same should apply to the payment of benefits. The increase in payments provided for the elderly should not be taken from them through the rent scheme operated by local authorities. There is a need for local authorities and Departments to work together with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to ensure increases provided for the elderly are not swallowed up by other State bodies. A minimum rent should be struck for the elderly, thus enabling them to be properly cared for in their homes.</P>
    <P>The headline funding provided in the Book of Estimates is one string to the Government&rsquo;s bow, but we must look beyond this to the delivery of services. The directors of services in county councils and HSE managers, for example, are well paid and have benefited from benchmarking. We need to measure the efficiencies and productivity achieved through these additional payments and the best delivery of services that can be achieved for the public through these public servants, but that is not happening because they are not delivering services on time or efficiently. It is up to senior management in Departments to ensure greater value for money is achieved.</P>
    <P>Accountability is a significant issue and the recent report issued by the Committee of Public Accounts on how the accounts of Departments are reported and spending is monitored should be taken on board by the Government. It would be a radical and progressive move if the Minister for Finance were to accept and implement it. If he did so, the powers of the committee would be extended and the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service would have a greater oversight role in regard to departmental accounts and the budget. When that happens, there will be proper accountability for the money spent on behalf of the taxpayer.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1615"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Hayes and Crawford.</P>
    <P>One of the shocking elements of next year&rsquo;s Estimates is the way in which the Government proposes to deal with the national seabed survey. The survey is one of the largest research projects undertaken, yet funding has been cut by a massive 72%. This is Government mismanagement at its worst because Ireland&rsquo;s seabed is an important resource. The national seabed encompasses an area ten times the size of Ireland. This is a significant resource but, to fully understand it, it must first be investigated, together with its potential. Those working on the project have done fantastic work, but they have more to do and cutting their funding will not serve anybody well. Most of Ireland&rsquo;s seabed is unmapped and a major untapped resource. An enormous opportunity awaits on our doorstep. The Government must maximise the commercial opportunities available while also striving to protect this valuable resource. How can either be done when we do not understand the seabed fully? The Estimates reveal that the Government has reduced the level of funding from &euro;3.5 million to &euro;1 million. Those involved in the project, whom I have met, are highly respected and doing a fantastic job. Such developments must be encouraged. Cutting funding for such important work makes no sense whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The Estimates also reveal that a number of key functions of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be transferred to the Department of Transport. It is bad enough that the Government feels maritime issues are of such little importance that they do not merit a separate portfolio but part of the portfolio will be transferred to the Minister of Transport who is responsible for the infamous Transport 21 plan. I am disappointed that the Minister has left the Chamber. According to the Book of Estimates, funding under Transport 21 will be provided for fencing posts and wire on the rail line between Claremorris and Sligo on State property, but the Government is determined to build roads through County Sligo. The N17 is the most treacherous road in the country and will not be improved for the next ten years, while it will be 2030 before West-on-Track&rsquo;s proposals are met.</P>
    <P>Transferring sections from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to subsections of another Department demonstrates contempt for maritime affairs. The Department has denied there are immediate plans to transfer responsibility for fisheries and aquaculture to the Department of Agriculture and Food. Is that the next trick up the Government&rsquo;s sleeve? Two ill-thought out developments were announced last week by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2005 involved no consultation with industry representatives and is a disgraceful document.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1616"/>
   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate and refer, in particular, to local authority issues. The vast majority of local authorities are struggling to keep their heads above water financially and the Government has abdicated its responsibilities in this regard. For instance, Tipperary Town Council faces a shortfall of almost &euro;500,000 in its budget this year. This is a significant amount for a town with a population of only 6,000. The shortfall has been attributed to the failure of a new refuse collection system to generate anticipated revenue. The system failed because many felt the refuse charges were too high. This is typical of the position in which many local authorities find themselves. They are forced to fund their budgets by introducing a host of charges citizens do not want to pay because they are stealth taxes. Such taxes are unjust, unfair and a sneaky way of extracting money from people. However, at the same time the Government claims we are living in a low cost, low tax economy.</P>
    <P>The supply of water is another major issue nationwide. We take our water supply for granted, but significant amounts of water are leaking from many local authority systems. The pipes used in a number of systems were laid 40 or 50 years ago and badly need to be replaced. I am inundated, particularly over the summer months, by some of my constituents who need water for animals, for their own domestic use, for bed and breakfast catering, for hospitals or for whatever is needed on a daily basis. There are breakdowns in the peak summer times and the local engineer will always say that the entire system, right across the county, is in bad need of repair. Some 55% of water is leaking into the ground because of a poor system. This cannot continue. The situation has not been addressed by anyone or by the Estimates. The local authority is coming under increasing pressure from year to year.</P>
    <P>We need to put the finances of the local authority in place. Only last week I talked to some members of Tipperary County Council who are clearly worried about the great increase they will have to impose if they are not better financed for all the issues that have to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Minister had a very successful visit in the Tipperary South constituency last Monday.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to give the Minister a message from many people I met there with regard to many schools in the county such as Bansha which are in clear need of much funding. There are many such schools in my constituency. We are concerned at the delay in attending to these schools and I need to talk to the Minister about this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will talk to the Deputy shortly.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1617"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>There are improvements in the Book of Estimates. I welcome, for example, the work being done on the national primary route through Monaghan, the M2, and the bypass of Monaghan town and Castleblaney. I spoke to someone from the Cavan end of the constituency who travelled to Dublin today but never got above 40 miles per hour on the M3. The way that route has been handled by the authorities, the impossible delays in the entire Navan route, and the lack of funding for the Cavan end of it, is something that must be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews said the Estimates got all the basics right. We are not cribbing on this side of the House but we are talking about facts. A lady contacted me last night regarding a young handicapped man who had a further accident and is now disabled from the neck down. He began a computer course but after two days at the training centre he was told he could not return because there was no money left to pay a classroom assistant. That is simple basics and is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There was talk of hundreds of thousands of medical cards being issued. In Cavan-Monaghan we lost 10,000 medical cards. In the Book of Estimates there is only a 9% increase in the budget. Therefore, the assertion of a 20% increase in the number of medical cards is bunkum. They cannot be delivered unless someone else draws up the budget.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand &euro;50 million of capital funding was sent back by the health service when so much money was needed. A 9% budget increase has to cover the entire nursing home debacle. I cannot help but mention the winding down of Monaghan General Hospital. What will that cost in lives? We have seen what happened in the past year, yet without any consultation, the hospital is wound down. I have said many times that I do not mind a winding down if alternatives are put in place. The Taoiseach said this morning in the House that the Cavan hospital is in chaos, yet he will agree to the closure of Monaghan in terms of any serious surgical work. He plans that the people involved will be moved to Cavan, which he says is in chaos.</P>
    <P>Where are we going? A 9% increase has been given to the north-eastern health area, the same as for other areas. No recognition has been given to the massive increase in the population of that area, above any other area in the country, and that has been the case for some time. When the Health Service Executive took over, we thought we would get some recognition at national level. In the North-Eastern Health Board area, Meath has increased in population by 33%, Louth by a little over 20%, while Monaghan-Cavan overall shows the highest increase in the country, yet there is no recognition of this in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness spoke about care for the elderly and I agree with him. It is marvellous to hear a Government backbencher saying this. We <Col N="1618"/>got total agreement with the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs that action should be taken in that regard, but the agreement did not result in any action being taken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the main features of my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006, obviously just focusing on the current spending because my capital has yet to be confirmed in the budget.</P>
    <P>Education has done extremely well in the Estimates. With an increase of 9% being provided for next year, way ahead of inflation, day-to-day spending will next year be &euro;7.2 billion, &euro;570 million more than this year. This is clear evidence of how much the Government believes in education, not just as a key driver of our economic prosperity, but as a vital tool for improving people&rsquo;s lives. We believe in providing the right opportunities at every level to enable each child to reach his or her full potential.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure all children get the best possible start in primary school, that they have access to a modern and broad curriculum at second level that is enhanced by a positive school environment and a well-motivated and supported teaching force, and that they have a chance to pursue the education or training option after school that is best for them, whether they want to be doctors, youth workers, scientists, mechanics, artists or whatever they want to do.</P>
    <P>We know that making this a reality requires huge commitment and investment on our part and we will not be found wanting. The increased funding for education next year will enable progress at every level to ensure that our education system continues to deliver for our children and for our economy. As with this year, there will also be an extra focus on tackling disadvantage and on improving supports for children with special needs. First, there will be an emphasis on ensuring the best and positive learning environment in all of our schools, with a focus on smaller classes at primary level and on measures to improve student behaviour at second level.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown an unprecedented commitment to improving the staffing levels in our schools, at primary level in particular. We have put more than 5,000 extra primary teachers in our schools in recent years and have targeted these at pupils with special needs and pupils from disadvantaged areas to ensure they get the extra help they need to reach their potential. We have also brought the average class size down to 24.</P>
    <P>Our record in providing extra staff for our schools is an area where we have shown real action but we are determined to go even further. I am proud to tell the House today that my Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2006 include funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1619"/>
   <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Department reach what it committed to in the programme for Government?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Finance has committed also to a further reduction in class size in the following year. In real terms what this means is that over the next two years we will put 500 extra teachers in our schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage. Schools will be asked to use the extra class teachers to ensure there are smaller classes for infants and young children rather than for the senior grades.</P>
    <P>In speaking about staffing in our schools, I have consistently said priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs. Under the action plan for tackling disadvantage published earlier this year, there will be smaller classes in disadvantaged schools. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place this term, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. Now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.</P>
    <P>Providing the best possible learning environment at second level is just as important. I am strongly committed to ensuring a positive atmosphere in all of our schools and to having effective procedures in place to deal with negative student behaviour where it occurs. Accordingly, &euro;2 million is being provided in the Estimates to enable me to begin implementing recommendations of the task force on student behaviour after its report is submitted to me next month.</P>
    <P>In providing extra funding to improve the learning environment in our classrooms, I have not forgotten the need to give more day-to-day funding and management support to our schools. At both primary and second level, I am glad to be able to again provide for increases in capitation funding that are way beyond the rate of inflation. At primary level the rate of capitation will increase by &euro;12 to &euro;146 per pupil from next January. There will also be increased funding for secretarial and caretaking services. When one compares the &euro;146 in capitation grants which they will get next year with the &euro;57 they got in 1997 our commitment to improving funding is clear. Capitation will also increase by &euro;12 per student at second level next year to &euro;298 per head while the support services grant will increase by &euro;4. In addition to this, an extra &euro;10 per student will be given to the voluntary schools to continue the process towards equalisation of funding measures for that sector where we have made great strides in recent years. What this means in practice is that a typical 500 student voluntary secondary school will get, from my Department next year, between capitation and support services funding, grants for secretaries and caretakers and equalisation funding, &euro;270,000 to meet its day-to-day costs outside of teacher pay, which is also covered by the Department. Extra funding will also be <Col N="1620"/>made available to the primary school management bodies. I will be in touch with them in the coming weeks about this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing more teachers, increased day-to-day funding and better management support, there are other important areas in which I am determined to make progress next year. Extra funding for teacher professional development will mean that in just over two years we will have increased spending in this area by 35%. This will cover, among other things, the provision of an in-service for teachers on a new technology subject at second level, a key element of ensuring that our second level curriculum is modern and diverse enough to allow room for all students to develop their own unique talents.</P>
    <P>In addition to improving the quality of the teaching in our schools it is vital to have the rights systems in place to evaluate outcomes for children in order that we can identify those who need extra help, give parents better information about their children&rsquo;s learning and inform policy decisions at national level. One development that has great potential in that respect is the introduction of a national system of standardised testing. I am determined to make major progress on this area next year and to secure the funds to support it.</P>
    <P>Funding for the primary school books scheme will also be increased by the order of 25%. Teachers of both first and second level schools will benefit from the investment being provided to establish an occupational health service for teachers and to support the development of the teaching council.</P>
    <P>Another area that merits a special mention is that of school transport where provision will increase by 30% to &euro;152 million next year. This will ensure that, as I and the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy de Valera promised earlier this year, every child will have his or her own seat and a seat belt on all our school buses by the end of next year. The extra money being given by the Government to education will allow progress across a whole range of areas in our schools to ensure our children get the best we can give them.</P>
    <P>There are some children who need extra support to help them to reach their full potential. I have also stressed that helping children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas is my priority as Minister and the provision being made for these areas next year reflects this priority. Under the new action plan for disadvantage, which I published during the year, there will be more funding for initiatives such as smaller classes in disadvantaged primary schools and increased funding for school books at primary and second level. There will also be a &euro;20 million increase in provision for third level student support schemes to almost &euro;230 million in 2006. My Department&rsquo;s approach to tackling disadvantage also reflects an awareness of the importance of the youth sector in providing positive recreational <Col N="1621"/>opportunities for young people in disadvantaged areas. More than &euro;45 million will be spent on this area in 2006.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the value of youthreach and VTOS programmes in providing second chance opportunities. I signal my commitment to developing that sector by providing increased non-pay funding for them next year. Non-pay funding for Youthreach and senior Traveller centres will increase by 8% while for VTOS it will increase by 19%. Next year, &euro;636 million will be spent on tackling disadvantage in education at all levels.</P>
    <P>In the area of special education we have already seen major improvements this year with the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, the increase in the number of special needs assistants and the guaranteed staffing allocation to primary schools. Next year we will build on those improvements where the Estimate is up 13% to more than &euro;640 million for 2006, which will ensure these children become our priority.</P>
    <P>The education system has a major role in ensuring that future Governments have the money they will need to fund public services many years from now and building the capacity of our higher education system to meet the skills and research needs of our economy today and in the future is crucial, and a priority for me as Minister. Next year, an additional &euro;80 million, or 7%, will be provided in core funding for the universities and institutes of technology. A separate process has commenced to examine a number of university pension cost issues. The funding provided includes support for ongoing initiatives to respond to social and economic skills needs in key areas such as the health therapy apprenticeships and information and communications technology.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, I am finalising proposals for important new developments in medical education which will increase the number of places available for school leavers from next year. The funding increases in the Estimates for my Department do not include the provision of a new strategic and innovation fund to support collaboration and reform in the third level sector, funding for which will be announced at budget time. I will make further announcements on overall capital projects in higher education before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;1 million has been provided in the Estimates to set up the Grangegorman development agency, the body which will develop the Grangegorman site for the DIT campus. The relocation of DIT which is spread over 30 different sites in Dublin to a 65 acre campus in Grangegorman will be the most ambitious educational building project ever seen in Ireland. This Government knows how important top class research will be to securing and protecting high skills jobs in the future. We are acting to put the necessary resources and infrastructure in place. I <Col N="1622"/>am delighted to announce that a dedicated research and development fund under the education Vote will increase by 17% next year, from &euro;69 million to &euro;81 million, allowing for cycle 4 of the PRTLI proposal, where &euro;600 million has been invested. From smaller primary classes to more medical training places and increased provision for third level research major progress will be made in all areas of our education system next year.</P>

	<P>The most significant aspect of the Estimate for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for 2006 is the confirmation that the Government has formally abandoned the commitment to increase Garda numbers by 2,000 within the lifetime of the Government. This is particularly bad news for members of the public, against the background of the current wave of gangland killings and the ongoing problems of crime, vandalism and anti-social behaviour that blight many communities. The commitment to increase the membership of the force to 14,000 was made as far back as 2002 by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il in their separate manifestos and jointly in their Government manifesto. Its implementation date has been pushed back further each year. It is clear that the increase of only 11% in the allocation for Garda salaries, wages and allowances will allow for only a small overall increase in Garda numbers during the year. This is especially so if, as the Government has promised, significant resources are to be devoted to breaking up the criminal gangs and Operation Anvil is to be continued which is totally dependent on overtime.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation for the office of the Garda ombudsman. I hope this will ensure the office will at last be up and running, at least next year, four years after it had been promised by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is disappointing there has been only a 3% increase in the allocation for services for victims of crime. The organisation dealing with the victims of crime has fallen apart and there is no separate organisation. Surely, given the resources available to the Government, something more could have been done rather than this paltry increase.</P>
    <P>There is a cut of &euro;23 million in the capital allocation for prisons which would suggest that the planned Thornton Hall prison project may well be in doubt, despite the bullish statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform today that everything was going ahead according to schedule. Fingal County Council has declared it a conservation area and is examining it with a view to putting a conservation order on it. The <Col N="1623"/>area is rich in archaeological remains and so on. Perhaps there is something in the Estimates that the Minister is not telling us. The entire prison budget is down by 3% and the Courts Service budget is down by 5%. It appears that has put paid to any new spending on a central courts system that had been planned by the Minister last year and was to be his great headline project for the coming year.</P>
    <P>What we have got from the Minister has been a great flamboyant flourish. He is strong on perception but weak on delivery. The key areas that affect the qualify of life have been neglected, the failure to provide the extra garda&iacute; that had been promised and the failure to do anything about gangland killings. This time last year he said he had done the devil and all and the matter was all but dealt with and yet there has been three times the number of gangland killings during the past 12 months as in the previous 12 months and there is no sign of them abating.</P>
    <P>The issue of anti-social behaviour has not been addressed, neither has the problem of drugs. Other than trying to do something about sniffer dogs and mandatory drug searches in prison, the Minister has no proposals to deal with the huge spread of drugs throughout the community. He is really not at the races in providing the services required. While money is being spent on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister is a little like his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, who has responsibility for the Department of Health and Children where much money is swallowed up with very little to show for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.</P>
    <P>In the limited time I have available I want to concentrate on a few areas of transport. We are all disgusted at the format of the Estimates which give so little information. Any debate on how money is spent is inadequately informed by the nature of the Estimates. In transport it is even more of a farce. While we have a different five-year envelope each year, the five-year envelope is not included in the Estimates and will be announced on budget day. It is farcical to discuss an Estimate that is already irrelevant.</P>
    <P>We already know that the Shannon stopover will end in 2006. One would have thought the Minister would have used the opportunity to invest in the west and prepare the Shannon region and the west generally to avail of the open skies policy and compensate for not having the certainty of flights from this country to their traditional destinations. Lip service has been paid to the Atlantic corridor which will be extremely important to opening up the west. If Shannon Airport is to survive, it will be as a tourist destination and will need the entire western coast as its catchment area. It is even more vague than the rest of the transport plan. Not alone does it have <Col N="1624"/>no starting date, it does not even have a termination date which most of the other projects have at least.</P>
    <P>It is critical to have good access to Shannon Airport from surrounding areas. The rail link in the west is to extend to Ennis. Inexplicably it will not extend to Shannon. That should have been the priority, yet we have not heard a word about it. The whole project has been postponed to 2014 which makes it laughable. For all the talk about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the spatial strategy and the west, when push comes to shove not one penny is allocated.</P>
    <P>We have all these promises to dig tunnels left, right and centre and I hope we will do so. However, in the meantime we need buses in Dublin. Clearly, the Government will not provide them this year because while the public service provision may allow for inflation, it does not allow for an increase in population or the number of buses. It clearly means they will not carry extra passengers. The Minister and the previous two Ministers with responsibility for transport have promised reform of the Transport Act 1932 in order to liberalise the bus market. When I asked the Taoiseach whether this was still Government policy, I was told he was still discussing the matter with Dublin Bus. After nine years of discussing it with Dublin Bus, will it ever take responsibility for buses? Dublin is grinding to a halt and it is not just Dubliners who are affected. People coming into the city are reporting they spend two hours on the outskirts on occasions when traffic is particularly bad. It is completely unsustainable for the population to increase by nearly 500,000 in the past ten years and only to have a handful of buses. In the past ten years we spent &euro;150 million on QBCs and bus lanes, most of which are empty of buses. We are surrendering road space and not putting buses on it. While the population is growing apace, we have no buses. The public is at its wits end. Is it any wonder everybody must buy a car and that we have total gridlock with more time spent in cars? To say the monopolist which will not compete will decide whether we will have enough buses is like an Eddie Hobbs joke.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have a bus lay-by beside the Luas to bring people from surrounding areas and all the new areas that have no bus service. Thousands of new houses were built in Stepaside and people were to come down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister should wait; he will get his chance. Thousands are coming down from this area to the lovely Luas service built at taxpayer&rsquo;s expense. Buses were to bring them down in their hundreds. We built the lay-by; we have the bus stop and the shelter but no buses. On routes served by a private operator miraculously Dublin Bus can find the buses to compete. <Col N="1625"/>The people without a bus service get nothing. The Minister for Transport ought to start taking responsibility as what is happening in Dublin is a disgrace and not sustainable.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In approaching the Estimates process I wished to secure funding that would allow us to promote Ireland&rsquo;s political, economic and humanitarian interests in the European Union and the wider world; to advance the process of securing peace, reconciliation and partnership on the island of Ireland; and to protect the interests of Irish citizens abroad. I am pleased to say the achievement of all these objectives is reflected in the 2006 allocation for the Department of Foreign Affairs. This funding will allow the Department to meet a number of important commitments and extend its outreach in a number of significant areas.</P>
    <P>The 2006 Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs consists of two Votes: &euro;186.6 million for Vote 28 &mdash; Foreign Affairs; and &euro;600 million for Vote 29 &mdash; International Co-operation or Overseas Development Assistance. I am delighted to announce that 2006 will see record expenditure on official development assistance. With the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, I have achieved the largest increase in overseas development aid by any Government. In September the Government announced that we would reach the UN target for spending on aid of 0.7% of GNP by 2012. We also announced a number of clear benchmarks along the way. We will reach the first of these, 0.47% of GNP, next year, which will be achieved through this Esti<Col N="1626"/>mate allocation, and reach the 0.5% benchmark in 2007.</P>
    <P>The Department&rsquo;s &euro;600 million allocation, taken with the contributions of other Departments, means total Government spending on aid will reach &euro;675 million in 2006. This represents an overall increase of &euro;129 million, or 24%, on the 2005 total aid allocation. The increase in the aid programme for next year is greater than the value of the entire aid programme in 1995 &mdash; &euro;123m. To put it another way, we will spend &euro;160 for every man, woman and child in the country in 2006 to help the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. We have trebled the allocation from 1998 to date and now commit to trebling it again between now and 2012.</P>
    <P>Speaking at the UN summit in September, the Taoiseach outlined four key areas of action for the expanding programme: doubling our funding for efforts to combat HIV-AIDS and other communicable diseases to &euro;100 million; providing extra resources to combat famine and hunger and improving our capacity to respond to disasters &mdash; the establishment of a rapid response corps, which I announced last week, will form an important part of this strategy; supporting an increased role for the private sector in development efforts; and increasing our support for efforts to strengthen governance and combat corruption. These four areas will provide the basis for the immediate expansion of the programme.</P>
    <P>Next year&rsquo;s White Paper, on which the Minister of State has widely consulted, will set the direction of policy for the coming years. It will ensure Ireland remains, in the words of the OECD, &ldquo;at the cutting edge of international development policy&rdquo;. One of the key challenges we face domestically is to build public awareness and understanding of the problems of under-development. I have asked my officials to explore new and imaginative ways of letting the people know what we are doing with their money.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a long and proud record of sending people to help the less able and less fortunate around the world. In this light, I was pleased to announce last week that the Minister of State and I would establish a volunteer corps unit within the Department. This unit will have a clear and straightforward mandate to harness the strong volunteer spirit across the country. We aim to utilise the wide range of skills possessed by Irish workers in industry, education, the health sector and across the public and private sectors to facilitate the matching of their skills with the needs of the developing world.</P>
    <P>We will provide greater assistance for existing volunteer and development agencies and identify opportunities for more Irish individuals to work with groups such as the United Nations volunteer organisation. With the ongoing commitment of the Government to the development agenda and the large and predictable increases now in prospect, we can set ourselves the achievable aim of <Col N="1627"/>being the best in the development field. That is what the public expects and deserves.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that the poor and the vulnerable can also be found within communities of Irish citizens who live abroad. The 2002 report of the task force on emigrants provided an agenda for action which my Department is proactively taking forward. I am delighted to announce that funding for emigrant services will again increase in 2006. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to this priority area is clearly demonstrated by the 45% increase in funding for 2005, to the unprecedented amount in 2006 of &euro;12 million. Overall, funding in this area will be 12 times greater than when the Government took office in 1997.</P>
    <P>These substantial increases in allocations reflect in the clearest way possible the strength of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to our emigrant communities, particularly in Britain and the United States. The Irish abroad unit set up in my Department a few years ago works in close partnership with emigrant support organisations at home and abroad to protect and advance the interests of vulnerable Irish communities overseas. Our partners in the voluntary sector have warmly welcomed the substantial increase in funding in recent years. The bulk of the funding will go to organisations helping those in the emigrant community in Britain who are in the greatest need of support.</P>
    <P>Another area of particular concern relates to the undocumented Irish in the United States. On the immigration front, this is a complex time of change and many of the undocumented Irish are living in stressful circumstances. Our funding to the Irish immigration centres across the United States is growing and supports the delivery of an enhanced range of services to our citizens. I know and appreciate that all parties in the House share our concern about the plight of undocumented Irish citizens in the United States. This was manifested in the support given by all sides to the recent D&aacute;il motion on the legislation in the US Congress sponsored by Senators McCain and Kennedy. The Government continues to avail of every opportunity to lobby for this important Bill and I will travel to Washington for this purpose next week.</P>
    <P>With regard to other allocations, there are increases across the spectrum. There will be a &euro;4 million increase in Ireland&rsquo;s funding contributions to international organisations. Most of this results from increased mandatory contributions to the United Nations, including an increase in Ireland&rsquo;s share of the UN peacekeeping budget. Our continuing commitment to the United Nations reflects its importance as the primary mechanism for ensuring international security.</P>
    <P>A significant increase is also being given in grant aid to the European Movement in Ireland to allow it to expand its work of disseminating information and stimulating debate on EU matters. We are providing an allocation of <Col N="1628"/>&euro;200,000 for my Department&rsquo;s obligations under phase 2 of the Asia strategy to facilitate incoming trade delegations and media visits from the priority Asian countries and the expansion of our exchange programme with them. A substantial increase for the promotion of cultural activities will provide our missions abroad with an improved capacity to further enhance awareness and appreciation of Ireland and Irish culture.</P>
    <P>With regard to Northern Ireland, the 2006 Estimates provide an allocation of &euro;2.7 million to resource the operation of my Department&rsquo;s reconciliation fund which supports cross-community engagement within Northern Ireland and enhanced contact and dialogue between both parts of the island and between Ireland and Britain. Compared to the scale of the EU Peace Programme and the International Fund for Ireland, the resources of the reconciliation fund are relatively modest. Nevertheless, it has proven to be very effective in making interventions in areas where the larger funding agencies might not have been as active and in generating goodwill in communities that hitherto might not have been well disposed to the Government.</P>
    <P>A significant proportion of Vote 28, some 79% of the gross Estimate, goes towards funding the operational costs of the Department&rsquo;s headquarters and its missions abroad, where as Deputies will agree, we provide facilities across the spectrum to look after the interests of Irish citizens and protect their safety abroad.</P>

	<P>As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, said yesterday, there is a degree of puzzlement among the people as to what the sums published in the Estimates will mean in reality. He gave the example of the proposed level of spending on health. People wonder where are all the services that ought to be in place if that amount of money is being spent. They need not be puzzled about some areas as we can see where the ongoing reductions in services are being made and where previous commitments to improvements have not been met.</P>
    <P>In my constituency Kerry General Hospital is a good example of where both staff and patients can clearly see that money is not being spent. The hospital scored badly in the recent audit of hygiene standards. In some quarters this has been <Col N="1629"/>attributed to carelessness or lack of professionalism on the part of staff, but I know from talking to those involved in cleaning the hospital that basic supplies are often not made available and the cleaners are expected to manage with inadequate supplies.</P>
    <P>There is a suspicion that this is part of a plan to downgrade Kerry General Hospital. That suspicion appears to have a solid foundation as a rumour is circulating that a senior officer in the Health Service Executive has stated this is the case. That is the logical conclusion that must be drawn, given the persistent refusal to address the crisis in the accident and emergency unit and the failure to appoint a cardiac specialist as requested. In the current situation where this downgrading is taking place &mdash; I am sure it is replicated in other hospitals &mdash; it is no wonder that people are taking the promise of increased spending with a grain of salt.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate.</P>
    <P>When we look at the details of the Estimates, we see the Government has up to &euro;1.5 billion extra to spend on budget day. There is a glorious opportunity to end the crisis at our accident and emergency units, to end the scandal of patients on trolleys and waiting lists for people with disabilities, to provide supports for our elderly and a child care package to assist families.</P>
    <P>State spending will rise next year by &euro;3 billion, or approximately 7%, to approximately &euro;48 billion. These figures sound great to citizens and taxpayers, but they ask why patients are still on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital. They want to know why children on Dublin&rsquo;s northside cannot get to see an occupational therapist and why there are 312 people with an intellectual disability on residential waiting lists for St. Michael&rsquo;s House services. It was a disgrace the way in which St. Michael&rsquo;s House was treated in the recent Hynes report as it is a caring and professional organisation that should be supported with more resources and funding for quality services. It is disgraceful that it was treated so badly in the media.</P>
    <P>People also want to know why young couples cannot get a home, why there are so many on housing waiting lists and so many homeless in our towns and cities. We can have all the talk we want about Estimates, but unless we spend wisely and carefully, these debates are not relevant to the people. When we look at the Estimate for education, we see an 8% increase but immediately wonder about the 52% of children in disadvantaged areas who are not ready for primary school.</P>
    <P>These are the real issues raised by the Estimates debate and should be the priorities. There is no excuse. Now is the time for the Government to introduce a comprehensive and caring budget.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1630"/>
   <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When I hear Government Deputies reciting endless lists of increases in certain percentages, I am reminded of the time I spent listening to Radio Moscow when I was a young boy in the mid-1980s. Listeners to that radio station would hear great tales of increases in factory production and other statistics aimed at proving that the Soviet state was making progress. The reality was that its foundations were crumbling underneath those who were reading the reports. That is also the reality in the case of the Government which has been corrupted by the years it has spent in power. We know that absolute power inevitably leads to such corruption. The Government is corrupt in the sense that its expenditure plans are designed to serve selective vested interests, rather than the interests of the people, even if it is not aware of it.</P>
    <P>I have often criticised the Government&rsquo;s expenditure on the roads programme on the basis that similar amounts of money are not being invested in the public transport system. Given that all the transport experts with whom I am familiar agree with me that the Government&rsquo;s policy does not make any sense, I presume it is being pursued to benefit the construction companies which are making money from pouring concrete. It is an example of a Government policy suiting the vested interests. Similarly, when I analyse the Government&rsquo;s utter failure to invest properly in energy conservation or put in place proper building standards to ensure the housing stock of the future will survive the impending oil crisis, I can only conclude that it has been set on that path by its developer friends who can be seen in the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway races. I can give many other examples of the Government being corrupted by certain vested interests. Some &euro;55 million has been spent on building up this country&rsquo;s fishing fleet in the past five years, but it is now proposed to spend a further &euro;45 million on decommissioning that fleet. It is another example of the incompetence, waste and corruption that lies at the foundation of the Government. For that reason, I ask the electorate to kick it out of office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did not show much gratitude for the time I agreed to share with him.</P>
    <P>A number of Opposition Deputies have called during this debate for the reform of the Estimates and budgetary process. The Minister for Finance said in last year&rsquo;s Budget Statement that he was open to considering how improvements could be made in the process in the context of the current situation. Three-year economic and fiscal programmes are published in the EU stability programme updates included in the budget booklet. The Government has started to adopt multi-annual capital budgets which allow it to focus more clearly on the reasons it is investing and what it expects from such investment. Each <Col N="1631"/>Department publishes strategy statements which set out what it is seeking to do. The Minister has been examining proposals for the reform of the process, in conjunction with his Government colleagues, since he made the announcement last year to which I referred.</P>
    <P>The recent report published by the Committee of Public Accounts is a useful contribution to the general consideration of this matter. The Minister has been considering options which would facilitate more informed D&aacute;il scrutiny of the global tax and expenditure budgetary aggregates and the individual Estimates of each Department, while retaining the Government&rsquo;s right and duty to direct and manage the budgetary process. We need to take care to ensure the annual budget is based on the most up-to-date information available and that the Government&rsquo;s ability to make timely decisions is not impacted on adversely. The Minister intends to return to this matter on budget day.</P>
    <P>Any reform of the budgetary and Estimates process will be in addition to the reforms of public expenditure management which the Government has introduced in recent years to improve public accountability in respect of public spending. Such reforms include the publication at the beginning of each year of monthly expenditure profiles to facilitate the ongoing monitoring of expenditure, the introduction of new management information systems across Departments to support improved accountability, improvements in the arrangements for the management and appraisal of public capital expenditure, reforms of public procurement and the expenditure review process. The reform process will complement the more recent value for money initiatives in respect of ICT projects and consultancies and additional general measures introduced by the Minister in October.</P>
    <P>I reject the charge of Deputy Bruton and others that we have nothing to show for the high levels of public expenditure in recent years and that there is no substance to the Estimates. Contrary to Opposition claims, there have been real improvements in public service outputs in recent years. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level decreased from 22.3:1 in 1996-97 to 17:1 in 2003-04. The ratio at second level dropped from 16:1 to 13.6:1 over the same period. At primary level this has been achieved, even though the number of pupils increased from 440,000 in 2000-01 to 446,000 in 2003-04.</P>
    <P>The number of inpatient and day case patient discharges from hospitals increased by 4.4% in 2004, compared to 2003. The number of day work discharges increased significantly by 8% in the same period, in line with international best practice. The number of nurses has not been falling, contrary to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s claims. There was an increase of over 5,100 in the four years from the end of 2000. There was an increase of more <Col N="1632"/>than 630 in the number of nurses in voluntary hospitals in the same period.</P>
    <P>The Government has significantly increased the rates of social welfare payments for the most vulnerable in society &mdash; the elderly and the young &mdash; in recent years. The rate of payment of old age contributory pension increased by 39% in real terms, from &euro;99 to &euro;179.30 per week, between 1997 and 2005.</P>
    <P>Some 23 national road projects are under construction. Some of the major projects which have been or will be completed this year include the Dundalk bypass and the Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, which were PPP projects, the M50 south-eastern motorway and the Carrickmacross bypass. Nineteen of the 23 major road projects which are under way are on or below budget and will be delivered on or ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>I refute the suggestion the Government has not delivered on its investment promises. It is strongly committed to investment as a key priority. It has made unprecedented levels of resources available to accelerate its attempts to address this country&rsquo;s infrastructural deficit. It has increased annual Exchequer capital investment from &euro;2 billion to almost &euro;6.6 billion in 2006. The results of the investment of some &euro;45 billion can be seen in all parts of the country. More than 70 national road projects, comprising over 500 km of road, have been completed since 1997. Service enhancement has doubled DART capacity. The Luas network carries an average of over 65,000 passengers each day. Over 45,000 social housing units were built between 1997 and 2005. Improvements in water, roads and environmental services have facilitated the construction of over 450,000 private houses. In introducing the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes in the 2004 budget the Government committed itself to keeping public capital investment at or close to 5% of GNP, or approximately twice the EU average. Exchequer capital spending, including capital carryover, has averaged 4.7% in the past four years. Exchequer capital investment in 2006 on a pre-budget basis will be 4.6% of GNP, compared with 3.4% of GNP in 1997 and 2.5% of GDP in the 15 established EU member states.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about public private partnerships. The Government&rsquo;s recent decision to establish a centre of expertise in the National Development Finance Agency and concentrate on PPP projects in the education, health and justice sectors, in addition to the transport area, will give impetus to the PPP process. The new arrangements will accelerate progress in developing PPP &ldquo;deal flow&rdquo; in the central government area by consolidating the relevant skills and capability for PPP procurement in this area. The Transport 21 proposals include a significant PPP element as part of a total investment package of &euro;33.4 billion between 2006 and 2015. This, like the Minister for Education and Science&rsquo;s recent announcement of 27 new school projects, is a concrete example of the emergence of an increased <Col N="1633"/>&ldquo;deal flow&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance will announce additional provision for investment when he sets out a new capital envelope for the 2006-10 period on budget day.</P>
    <P>The sound fiscal and economic policies which have been pursued by the Government have led to increased prosperity and improved quality of life for citizens. The Government&rsquo;s policies have allowed it to fund real improvements in public services and target priority social needs. The 2006 pre-budget Estimates provide for gross expenditure of some &euro;48.5 billion, &euro;42.2 billion of which is current expenditure and &euro;6.3 billion of which is capital expenditure. The overall figure represents an increase of almost &euro;3 billion, or 6.6%, on 2005. Some 70% of the additional &euro;2.7 billion being provided for current spending is being allocated to the key priority areas of health, education and social welfare. The Minister will make additional provision for spending on budget day in the areas of social welfare, child care, care of the elderly and investment. I commend the motion to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been said that this debate on management companies is taking place in the context of tremendous increase in the construction of homes in recent years. The fact that apartment complex management has become the subject of such attention is partly a result of the huge increase in apartment development in recent years. Apartments accounted for 22% of residential units built in 2004. Almost 70% of residential units built in Dublin in 2004 were apartments.</P>
    <P>This is part of the bigger story about Ireland&rsquo;s incredible housing boom. The achievements we have seen in the housing construction industry in the past decade or so are nothing short of phenomenal. We have had rates of house building not seen elsewhere in Europe. Over the past ten years nearly half a million new housing units have been built, which means that three out of every ten homes have been built within the last ten years. Almost 77,000 units were completed in 2004, an extraordinary figure, which is double the level achieved in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government has successfully promoted a range of measures to boost the overall supply of housing, to modernise and develop the private rented sector and provide a range of well targeted schemes to meet the needs of those who cannot afford accommodation in the private sector. As a result, we have seen record levels of housing output in recent years while social housing outputs have reached levels not seen for more than a generation.</P>
    <P>A range of targeted schemes has been put in place to assist first-time buyers in recent years. These include the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, affordable housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004 and the affordable housing initiative in Sustaining Progress. Record levels of funding are being allocated to local authorities for their housing programmes in 2005 and a major programme of regeneration and remedial works is currently under way.</P>
    <P>Ireland has seen enormous growth in the development of apartment block living over the past ten years or so. Apartments have great advantages particularly in ensuring public transport and other public facilities in urban areas are viable. At the same time, the increase in the numbers of apartments force us to face different problems of ownership and co-operation between home owners.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that management companies have an important role in dealing with the ongoing maintenance of apartment blocks and other high density developments which have shared facilities. They are necessary to deal with management and maintenance of apartment complexes because of the extent of shared or communal elements involved. These range from corridors and lifts, to pipes and cables for services, the roof and structure of the building and outside areas such as car parks and open spaces. While <Col N="1637"/>in the case of a traditional house, the owner or occupant has to deal with maintenance, repair, insurance and so forth, these functions must also be carried out in apartment complexes. It is more complicated because of the number of individual owners and the fact they share many of the facilities. Therefore, the management company in an apartment complex must carry out many of the roles played by the individual owner in a traditional house.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 allows planning authorities to attach conditions to planning permissions, including conditions regarding the setting up of management companies. It is a matter for planning authorities to use these powers appropriately. Individual planning authorities must make their own judgment, based on local circumstances and policies, about how and to what extent to use them in particular cases. However, it should be noted that the existence of a management company does not relieve local authorities of their responsibilities in providing basic services such as water and waste water services. Nor does it relieve developers of their responsibilities to finish developments satisfactorily. If, as has been alleged, developers are trying to transfer the cost of finishing the services in estates to the purchasers, on top of the purchase price, that is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said yesterday, the Planning and Development Act contains strong provisions regarding the completion of estates by developers. First, the general enforcement powers in relation to developments which are not completed in accordance with the terms of the permission have been strengthened and tightened. One instance is that planning authorities are now obliged to follow up genuine complaints about breaches of planning control within a given timeframe. Another is that planning authorities can refuse to grant planning permission, subject to the consent of the High Court, to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous permission. Second, the Planning and Development Act gives a specific power to planning authorities to attach a condition to the permission requiring the developer to give adequate security, before commencing the development, to ensure the estate is properly finished in accordance with the terms of the planning permission.</P>
    <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 is also clear on the question of the taking in charge of estates. Section 180 provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the developer or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners or occupiers of the houses involved, initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act 1993 for declaring the roads to be public roads, for whose maintenance the local authority will then be responsible. With the roads goes the responsibility for water and waste water pipes, pavements and so on.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1638"/>
   <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all learnt from the experience of developers particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s when the economy was starting to take off. At that time many housing estates were left in an inadequate state of repair by developers, and householders in the main found that roads were not completed, public lighting was not to the standard required and they had problems with waste water and sewerage facilities. Therefore, the tabling of this motion is timely.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister of State say that under section 180 of the 2000 Act which deals with the taking in charge of estates obligations are placed on developers and that is only right. In the past too many cowboys, so to speak, have left estates unfinished, moved on and applied for another planning permission which was granted. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, local authorities and planning offices can insist that where a developer has not completed a previous development to the standards requested by that local authority, further permission can be refused with the consent of the High Court.</P>
    <P>While some people may be of the view that apartment blocks are the preserve of the larger urban areas of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick, most county towns have seen a large increase in the number of apartment blocks being completed. Planning applications currently on hand suggest this is the way housing developments are proceeding. Management companies are necessary to deal with the management and maintenance of apartment complexes because of the extent of shared elements involved. It would be unfair if the Government did not address this issue through local authorities.</P>
    <P>From time to time, every householder must meet the cost of routine maintenance, be it for repairs or refurbishment, as well as insurance and some level of security. For too long when an estate or apartment block has been completed it was taken in charge by a local authority which was landed with the responsibility of looking after the routine maintenance of the properties. In the case of an apartment complex, the management company must make financial provision for the maintenance of corridors, lifts and roofs, which appear to be a major cause of concern to many apartment owners. Obviously, management fees should be reasonable but they must also be sufficient to provide against possible future costs. In some instances when costs have arisen, management charges have been increased steeply because insufficient funds have been put aside. As apartment blocks get older, the cost of maintenance increases.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance of having a system of collective management in operation in apartment complexes, apartment buyers are legally obliged through the conveyancing process to become members of management companies and to pay the appropriate rate. It is interesting when we live in a time of record house building &mdash; more <Col N="1639"/>than 70,000 units were completed last year and somewhere in the order of 75,000 units were completed this year &mdash; that this motion should come before us. Local authorities in particular are concerned about their exposure when they take housing estates and apartment complexes in charge. Sometimes the bonds entered into by developers in negotiations for planning permission do not cover the costs involved and individual apartment and household owners have to dip into their pockets again to pay the cost of repairs. This happens, in particular, in cases where developers get planning permission but sit on it for a couple of years before commencing the development. In the meantime, the cost of construction has increased to such an extent that the bond provided is insufficient. It is not good enough to simply put the onus on local authorities. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has a responsibility and I note it is being lobbied by local authorities in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the role of local authorities and local authority members in regard to this matter. We need to look at this matter in the context of the general development within the country and the move we have seen over a very short period from the traditional style house and housing estates to a mixture of large blocks of apartments and housing units close by, usually townhouses with greater density than is normally the case. In rural areas we have seen small villages and towns outnumbered by the new houses being constructed. That has happened generally throughout County Kilkenny. Most, if not all, of these planning applications have been granted in the usual way with the clauses one would expect. However, in recent times, I have seen a difference in policy between neighbouring counties. There is no consistency across the country in the approach to the granting of permission and the control of these estates in the planning process.</P>
    <P>In my experience, the management companies that have emerged deal with the upkeep of large blocks of apartments, as distinct from housing estates. The management companies in housing estates are not what is described in the context of legislation, which refers to those management companies that deal with large apartments. Management companies are absolutely necessary in the context of large apartment complexes. However, I am concerned that the management fee can be constantly increased. I hope the Law Reform Commission can examine this aspect of the matter. What was initially a reasonable fee can in time become a substantial amount of money. If we can legislate on management companies and put a control on how fees can be increased on a year-to-year basis we would be doing something constructive. Perhaps this is something the Law Reform Commission would <Col N="1640"/>examine and on which it would make recommendations.</P>
    <P>In general, I regret that we no longer have a role in the planning process. In some ways that is to be welcomed but there is an issue in regard to the policy surrounding county development plans and the engineers&rsquo; interpretation of those plans. In the context of those plans, we should ensure they contain statements that deal with all of the issues that concern us, that are being highlighted in the motion before us. Public representatives have a role to play in highlighting this issue at local level and ensuring it is dealt with in the context of those plans. When we debate the loss of powers for local public representatives we should bear in mind that they can exert their power, ask for a role to play and insist on issues like this being dealt with in the context of local development plans.</P>
    <P>In taking over estates in my local area, management companies have been involved in a useful exercise with the local branch of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF. For many years the reliance on bonds from building contractors has caused difficulties as bonds are rarely called in. Arguments continue with local government officials and those who live in housing estates to get their estates completed in the first place. The process is now becoming more organised which has made it easier for estates to be taken over. There is a need to strengthen that process. It is within the remit of county managers and public representatives to come together with those in the construction industry to strike a deal that will look after the interests, not only of good planning within council areas but also the interests of the residents involved in those estates. This is a huge issue. No single rule applies consistently across the country. The matter should be reviewed and, if necessary, the issues that arise from the review should be legislated for to bring about a consistent approach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been extensive house building in the State in recent years. Apartments now account for 41% of planning permission for housing throughout the State. In the case of Dublin, this figure rises to 74%. By any standards this is a fundamental change for society, one to which we as policy makers must respond.</P>
    <P>This is a new issue. I thank Deputy Gilmore for raising it in the House this evening and last night. Planning authorities operate under the 1999 guidelines on residential density. It is obvious that higher residential densities must be promoted in appropriate locations. The phrase, &ldquo;appropriate locations&rdquo; is critical. I worry that the number of high density apartment developments being sanctioned in older traditional areas of the city is now threatening the sustainability of these suburban communities. I am not sure the Dublin city development plan adopted this year has addressed this issue in any comprehensive way.</P><Col N="1641"/>
    <P>The 1999 guidelines provide that, in promoting higher densities, emphasis must be placed by planning authorities on the importance of high quality standards in regard to design and layout in order to ensure the highest quality of residential environment is achieved. The guidelines state that the overriding concern should be the quality of the proposed residential environment and that higher densities are only acceptable if a range of criteria are satisfied. These include the size of the site, its proximity to ancillary facilities and quality public transport, the quality of the lay-out proposed, the mix of dwelling types, the provision of appropriate social and community facilities, the quality of the open space and amenity provision and pedestrian linkages, levels of privacy, traffic safety, access to local facilities and whether the needs of children, the elderly and the disabled have been taken into account.</P>
    <P>The guidelines recognise in particular that the private spaces of every dwelling should enjoy freedom from undue observation and that no undue loss of light should be caused by adjoining higher buildings. More generally, the guidelines provide that in residential areas of an established character, the design approach should recognise the need to protect the amenities of directly adjoining neighbours and the general character of the area and its amenities. The time has come to review the implementation of these guidelines in the interests of our built heritage and community life. Dublin City Council does not take those criteria fully into account.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom Dunne, the chairman of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, recently highlighted another aspect of this problem. He stated that failure to maintain the large number of apartment blocks built in recent years could lead to a serious deterioration in the quality of the urban fabric of our cities. Such apartment blocks require long-term maintenance and this requires money. Occupiers must pay for this. That is why management companies are so important. Management companies must be regulated, perhaps through a State licensing system. Such regulation must deal with issues such as qualifications of agents and auditing of accounts.</P>
    <P>The poor quality of design of many new apartment schemes is another issue and it is manifested in many ways. An alarm clock going off in one apartment will almost certainly wake up the residents next door. The Building Control Act 1990 provides for making national building regulations. Parts A to M must be reviewed now to address the serious complaints of today&rsquo;s apartment dwellers. The 2002 energy performance of buildings directive is in place. It involves the introduction of building energy ratings for new buildings and existing buildings when they are being sold, let or re-let. I welcome the introduction of such energy rating listings.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that planning authorities make it a condition of planning permission that management companies be formed to administer <Col N="1642"/>new private housing schemes. The practice must be investigated urgently. It would seem on the face of it that local authorities are abdicating their responsibilities on service provision to save money. I welcome moves by the Minister to examine the practice of each local authority and the fact that the Law Reform Commission working group is investigating the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF"><NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me. I agree with the thrust of this motion and it is a timely one before the House. I have seen the effects of massive overdevelopment in my area. I have also seen where development levies paid to local councils are not spent as they should be or are not spent soon enough.</P>
    <P>I have seen estates developed around, but unconnected to, what were up to five years ago villages to the north of Dublin city. I was in such a village recently and I saw parents pushing buggies and prams while using the main road to return to their estate, trying to keep their places with traffic. Lorries and cars passed them at speed, with no regard for anyone else on the road. If an estate is built near a village, infrastructure such as footpaths and cycle lanes should be put in place initially along with the water mains, electricity and sewerage. To build an estate and leave it unconnected with its main shopping area is scandalous.</P>
    <P>We are discussing management companies as well as development companies. My constituency has seen the highest density in the country of apartment block development. When it first started I was delighted because slums were being cleared. Apartment blocks were built on property that had remained derelict for 30 or 40 years. However, I began to realise that nobody was there at weekends. Where many apartment blocks are built along a street, such as Brunswick Street in my constituency, it is dark at night apart from street lighting. Nobody is there at weekends. They are built for single people or couples. No thought is given to family friendly apartment blocks.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council tells us we need higher densities to accommodate much more people. What type of people are we accommodating? Is there any room for a couple with two or three children? They are built without playgrounds, facilities or cr&egrave;ches. We are taking an extremely narrow view on development. That is the case in my area. I am afraid we are developer-led. One cannot tar them all with the same brush and some developers are good. However, the bottom line for anyone in the business is the financial return. Reading the paper, one sees enormous prices paid per acre for land. When one considers the density required or sought, one realises the profits are way out of line with what we are used to. We are not taking a hard look at what the future holds. I realise I cannot foresee the future. However, I suspect the slums of the future are <Col N="1643"/>being built today in certain areas in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The finish is another matter not given consideration. The area I represent is mainly red brick. The houses are durable and many of them have been there for more than 100 years. They are capable of being revamped and gutted to bring them up to modern standards. When I was a member of the former Dublin Corporation and these developments took place, the developer always chose a render finish on the outside, perhaps with a small amount of brick. One may think this is a small point but it is not. Cement render does not stand the test of time. It collects dirt from the atmosphere. Developments that went up ten or 15 years ago in my constituency had either render finish or wood finish. Now they leave much to be desired. I speak as someone from Dublin city centre and these are the problems we face. Rural and suburban Ireland have other problems. These are the issues I see arising. We must impress on local authorities that we need higher standards, we must look to the future and there is no point in building rabbit hutches or chicken runs. We are trying to accommodate human beings with a future and families to bring up in a family friendly environment.</P>

	<P>I am sure we will hear more of this closer to the election.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and I support the general thrust of the Labour Party motion. The increasing prevalence of management companies as an alternative to local authorities taking charge of housing developments is causing significant difficulties to householders. The Government is failing to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions my party has raised the need to regulate the operations of management companies, particularly in the case of apartment complexes where, unlike housing developments, they are likely to remain a feature long into the future because of the issue of communal space. I hope the Minister will heed recommendations of the Law Reform Commission when it concludes its consideration of legislation in respect of multi-unit structures.</P>
    <P>The legislation has become outdated and has not kept pace with changes in the patterns of housing developments or increased deviousness <Col N="1644"/>of greedy developers. This issue has been brought to my attention by a number of Sinn F&eacute;in councillors and public representatives in Dublin. In particular, Felix Gallagher of Fingal County Council has raised the matter of Tyrellstown, Dublin 15. I attempted to raise this matter in the House for Councillor Gallagher and asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to investigate the collapse of the estate management company, O&rsquo;Donovan Property Management Limited.</P>
    <P>Residents who paid a cumulative total of &euro;60,000 to O&rsquo;Donovan Property Management Limited are facing demands for payment in advance from a new management company, Smith Property Management, for work that was meant to be completed by O&rsquo;Donovan Property Management Limited. This has escalated to the point where a number of residents are facing potential legal action. This case illustrates the difficulties that can arise in the absence of legislation to regulate the operations of management companies.</P>
    <P>I refer to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. Last night, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated: &ldquo;Under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act, local authorities are obliged to take in charge the public services of housing estates, once completed to a satisfactory standard, where requested to do so by a majority of the residents of the housing development, or by the developer&rdquo;. Is the Minister satisfied this section is performing as it was intended to do? From instances brought to my attention I must conclude it is not being enforced or it is deficient.</P>
    <P>There is evidence developers are evading provisions of section 180 by delaying the completion of works as a tactic to maintain control of developments through their management companies. Some developers will complete the majority of work to have the local authority return bonds they have given. They will delay completing work where the smallest bonds have been given. Has the Minister considered introducing amendments to this legislation to insert timeframes within which developers are obliged to complete work necessary to bring development to the status where it can be taken in charge?</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution, or the Government amendment, to suggest they intend to address the problems increasingly affecting homeowners in new housing developments across the State.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Labour Party on its motion before the House and I treat the Government amendment with the contempt I believe it deserves. There is a real danger in privatising what should be public space. In the rushed frenzy to create a new Ireland of high density buildings, there is a danger we do not get the <Col N="1645"/>design quality, finish and attention to detail needed.</P>
    <P>Housing developed by local authorities and the private sector 50, 60 or 70 years ago consisted of carefully designed buildings and well considered public space. Examples include Cabra, Drimnagh and other well-planned estates in Dublin. These put people and children first, allowing a parent to stand at the door and call a child in for tea. That does not happen anymore, when the car is king and people are pawns in the planning equation.</P>
    <P>New private housing estates have a sea of car parking but no space for children to play. We are left with wedges of green space and chunks of cobble lock and tarmacadam, without adequate consideration to how resultant space can be maintained, managed and financed. It is crucial local authorities take greater control over this process and planning authorities, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la, put more guidance into new developments. We must pay attention that a developer will complete the works he or she has guaranteed as a condition of planning permission. We must ensure that owners or tenants have a meaningful role in that management. We should be careful of the privatised model; first an estate is gated, then guarded and finally ghettoised.</P>
    <P>We need more local area plans under the Planning and Development Act 2000 although I am not convinced these plans pay attention to the needs. We can be sure that developers, jumped-up muck savages used to building dog houses and now building high-rise apartments, are not giving these schemes the attention to detail they deserve. We must insist on high quality in these new developments and I am not convinced the average standard is high enough.</P>
    <P>There is deafening silence from the Government on detailed criteria and guidelines for these new developments. High density guidelines date from five years ago but there is no recent pronouncement on the issue and we are not getting the quality we need. I was delighted to see An Bord Plean&aacute;la reject a 17-storey block next to two-storey housing in Sandyford. We need a mix in housing developments but this is too high a cost to pay.</P>
    <P>We need to see a mix of housing in new developments. Major attention must be paid to outdoor space so that older people can feel safe and younger children can play without too much concern for safety. We need to provide a mix of housing to the very old, who are at risk of being consigned to the lashed crosses of this world, and the very young, equally at risk of being sidelined by the housing process. It is crucial we do not privatise public space and that we have high quality design. I intend to support this motion, with my party colleagues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, about which I have been concerned for some time. I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 29 September and received a <Col N="1646"/>reply from the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, confirming that the practice of insisting on mandatory management companies as a planning condition for housing estates had no legal basis. When I tabled a priority question on 25 October, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, was categoric. My expectation was that the practice would be stopped for future developments as there was no legal basis for such conditions. I welcomed that and a survey of planning practice by the local authorities that followed.</P>
    <P>My concerns are for those caught in the trap because they have signed contracts, for the taking in charge of estates and for legislation surrounding apartments.</P>
    <P>If there is no legal basis for this and it can be stopped for new developments, how is it enforceable for those who are currently caught in the mandatory membership trap? My understanding is that contract law in this country states that one cannot contract outside of the law, so if there is no legal basis for this, how can it be enforced? The dominoes have begun to fall on this subject and I can foresee a situation where an unenforceable condition will produce problems, whereby estates are abandoned by developers and one neighbour pays management company fees while another is dragged through the courts for refusing to do so. I do not need to write the script. This is all avoidable but it requires a commitment by the Minister and the Government to tackle the retrospective issue. I urge the Minister to seek advice from the Attorney General on the matter because it needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>On the issue of taking estates in charge, section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 allows electors in a housing estate to petition to have an estate taken in charge. However, when one reads the details, that can only occur after seven years and the clock only starts ticking after the five year planning permission period has run out. That is 12 years in total, so in reality, having an estate taken in charge takes much longer than five years. Furthermore, it can only occur if enforcement proceedings have not commenced. Does the Minister really expect local authorities to take an unfinished estate in charge if they can avoid doing so by issuing enforcement proceedings? I have seen enforcement proceedings commence and then disappear on countless occasions. Perhaps I have come to be cynical from watching this issue so closely.</P>
    <P>I have a list from County Kildare which shows the total number of houses on the so-called &ldquo;for taking in charge&rdquo; list. The most recent list is for 2002, but the situation has worsened since then. There are 19,000 houses in Kildare on that list. I do not know what the figure is nationally. Some housing estates have been described by the council as &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo;, some are over 30 years old while some are reasonably new. The construc<Col N="1647"/>tion industry has not covered itself in glory in this matter. Most estates do not have management companies, but even where they exist it is likely the estates will simply be added to the end of the &ldquo;for taking in charge&rdquo; list. Existing law falls down badly on the enforcement side. I tabled a parliamentary question seeking a survey of the situation nationally, which the Minister refused to conduct. Can that be reconsidered and some targets for progress on the matter put in place?</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts that apartments require some element of management of shared spaces but this should not include areas outside of the sites, such as public roads, sewers or the water mains. Urgent legislation is needed in that area and we need a timeframe from the Government on when it will be initiated.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion for debate and I thank my colleague in the Technical Group, Deputy Joe Higgins from the Socialist Party, for the work he has done on this issue. Most especially, I thank my Independent colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, for pursuing this issue with vigour since she was elected to this House. Her efforts have succeeded in bringing the matter to the forefront and it is now receiving the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see how the political parties keep the work of Independent Deputies under review and to see how the Labour Party, in this instance, has taken its lead from the Independents.</P>
    <P>The reluctance of local authorities, with the <i>imprimatur</i> of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to take in charge housing estates has led to the situation we are in today. Local authorities no longer feel an obligation to take estates in charge but rather feel quite justified in imposing conditions on planning permission requiring management companies to be set up, with the result that individuals struggling with mortgage repayments and service charges are also burdened with the costs associated with such companies. This situation is a cop-out on the part of the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is being abused by developers. There is only one way to deal with this. The local authorities must ensure that estates are constructed in compliance with planning permission, building regulations and to an overall high standard of construction. When estates are completed, the authorities must take the developments in charge, either at the request of the developer or the residents.</P>
    <P>Unfinished housing estates are a blight throughout Ireland. They are the cause of major hassle for residents, who feel totally powerless to better their lot when faced with the stubborn resistance of ruthless builders who have no conscience when it comes to living up to their obli<Col N="1648"/>gations. Estates which are supposedly complete, but not to an acceptable standard, are also a blight and can cause grief for residents. If we had a properly resourced policing system, we would eliminate all of this hassle. Residents are entitled to be protected by legislation. We have legislation on the Statute Book which could eliminate many of the problems but unfortunately, the local authorities are not properly resourced to implement the terms of the most recent building control regulations. This scandal should be rectified now. It should also be a priority for the Minister to immediately instruct local authorities to use their resources wisely and prudently in the limited number of inspections they are currently carrying out. It is absolutely nauseating to see local authority personnel abuse their position in hounding young couples who, for example, do not have the money to provide a parking area outside their dwelling, as per the conditions of the planning permission, while at the same time, big developers get away with totally unfinished estates. The incident with the young couple to which I referred came about because an employee of the local authority had a disagreement with them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome and support the Labour Party motion. It echoes the position that I have been putting forward in the D&aacute;il and the position that the Socialist Party in Fingal County Council has been strongly advocating for over a year. Unfortunately, Labour Party councillors in Fingal were, up to now, not very supportive but I have no doubt that the spokesperson for the party on local government and the environment will brief the councillors thoroughly on the contents and the import of this motion and that they will adopt a much firmer and better position from now on.</P>
    <P>The management company setup is a scam by which developers evade the costs they would have hitherto borne for finishing off estates and maintaining them to some degree until they were officially handed over the local authority. It is also, following the handover to the residents, which is what is envisaged, a blatant privatisation of services.</P>
    <P>When I have raised this issue with the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as recently as yesterday, I have been met with generalities. The Government says it is opposed but in west Dublin, Meath, Kildare and other areas, thousands of householders are faced with enormous bills, at the very time they are vulnerable to large mortgage payments, child care costs and so on, imposed first by the developers who control the management companies and later by local authorities which insist that the services be privatised. The management companies are controlled for several years by the developers who are demanding annual fees from the same householders from whom they have made a massive profit in the sale of those houses.</P><Col N="1649"/>
    <P>The level of the scam is shown by the home development in Tyrrellstown in west Dublin in 2000, where the budget for 2006 provides for total management fees of &euro;355,000, of which administration costs are proposed to be &euro;119,000, one third of the total. A further &euro;19,000 is to be demanded, on top of the total, for public liability insurance. So, if somebody falls in the main thoroughfare, rather than the local authority having to answer, it is householders in the estate who will be called upon to pay. Clearly, even in the worst days, the Taca days of the 1960s, the mohair suits who supported Fianna F&aacute;il at that time would not even have dreamt of such a scam.</P>
    <P>Twenty householders will be dragged to court by these same developers, masquerading as management companies on foot of civil process in January. What words of comfort can the Government offer to them and the thousands who are stuck with this development? What does the Minister have to say in this regard? Will he ask the developers to pull back, the local authorities to end this immediately and take those householders out of the stress they are suffering?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has said nothing on the wider issue of the application of management companies in housing estates. I warn Fianna F&aacute;il, the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael on this issue &mdash; it is only beginning. It will be a major issue in crucial constituencies in the election and they had better get their act together on it and stand with the hard-pressed householders, mortgage payers, working people and PAYE people and resolve it forthwith.</P>

   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and compliment my colleague Deputy Gilmore, the Labour party spokesperson on the environment and local government, on tabling this motion. We are delighted with the support we are receiving.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy sharing time?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sharing with Deputy Upton.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore made the interesting point that domestic rates were abolished in 1977. Now we are getting rates back under another name, an imposition in the form of management charges for housing estates and apartment blocks. I will not go into the nitty gritty of this because Deputy Upton has some interesting cases to reveal on this matter and I will not trespass on her ground. The charges are paid to private management companies often owned or controlled by the same developers who have crucified young people and put them to the pin of their collars to pay for houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore brought a Bill before the House on 8 March 2005 which was dear to the Labour Party. It might not go down so well with big supporters in the tent. We are not in a tent but rely on the &euro;2 or &euro;5 that people give us at the door of the local pub or for raffle tickets. The <Col N="1650"/>number of unfinished housing estates across this country is a scandal. Builders leave homes surrounded by rubble, litter and the remains of their work and do not complete essential aspects of the plans, such as footpaths and play areas. Young people get into hock to pay for those services but receive nothing. Not satisfied with the flesh off their bones the builders want the bone as well. I agree with Deputy Joe Higgins that it is a rush to privatisation and it is about time it was stopped.</P>
    <P>I warn Members that in a month, people coming to Dublin from Mullingar and the midlands to work will pay &euro;25 a week for the privilege of travelling on the road. If they have to go to the West Link it will cost &euro;2,000 per year to line the pockets of the very wealthy. It is part of right-wing ideology to make people pay for everything regardless of whether they have the means. So much for Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the workers will rebel and demand a decent wage. The Government will impose the wages to be paid by the employers and there will be a rebellion outside Kinnegad. What if somebody, rushing with a child from a hospital incomplete since 1997 and having to get to Dublin is required to pay a toll as well?</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy is straying from the motion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no time for this exercise in privatisation or for everything existing for the benefit of a few at the expense of many. Many estates where they charge this money are publicly owned and all services are provided by the local authorities. Developers grab their share of services for which people have paid their taxes. This is the essence of the problem and should provoke a rebellion because people have had enough. It is unbelievable that another &euro;20 per week is imposed on people who are at their wits end. If the road ever reaches Mullingar, the local authority will not allow it and will make it part of the conditions for planning permission.</P>
    <P>The Government has the power to prevent it by directing managers and local authority planning offices not to let it happen. Deputy Stagg and others gave examples and those people know what they are talking about. They are not fools and we should heed them. We should tighten up consumer legislation to ensure the protection of people instead of pussyfooting around in case we step on the toes of the next builder already laughing all the way to the bank. I remember the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, saying it was a great idea to reduce capital gains tax. Apart from an increased flow to the Exchequer, he said it would release land into the system. If capital gains tax was 20% rather than 40%, the reduction would feed into the price of a house. It was an excuse, not a reason. Developers threw a big rope around it as if it were a haystack and gathered that in as well. I call it hay cart economics. They got the seeds as well as the hay.</P><Col N="1651"/>
    <P>Our job is to ensure local authorities are provided with the necessary finance to ensure officials are in a position to take estates in charge. Some of the statistics colleagues have given are frightening. In my county we have prevented this from happening, perhaps because we in the Labour Party are very vociferous at local level. We stepped up to the brink to ensure that the privatisation of services was not railroaded in on top of us. Those of us who come from simple and humble beginnings do not forget where we come from and we know who pays the piper. It is the unfortunate working class people.</P>
    <P>When I was younger I thought only apartments had common areas and management charges but developers have prospered and decided to spread their wings into ordinary housing estates. Deputy Joe Higgins referred to 2,000 houses. It is an open cheque book. When people pay &euro;250,000 for a house, they should not have to pay any more. Their eyes are out on sticks working every hour of the day and community spirit has disappeared.</P>
    <P>That spirit characterised country areas like Celbridge, which I was glad to hear continues to have a sense of community, but it is very difficult to travel long distances, leave a child in a cr&egrave;che at 7 a.m. and pay child care charges, which are a huge burden and bigger than a mortgage in some cases, then return in the evening to collect the child, have something to eat and, drained, go to bed. There is no opportunity to engage with neighbours or build community solidarity where people help each other out because there is no time. People would like the time but that is the society we have created. All we are doing is rubbing more grease into the fat pigs.</P>
    <P>Developers already make plenty of money. There should be no opt-out to the condition that enables a council to take a charge. That is a primary function of a local authority. We must give local authorities enough money to put in place enforcement officers. Does the Minister know his Department has had more restrictions imposed on it by the Department of Finance? Local authorities cannot take on staff or even replace people who leave.</P>
    <P>Developers of large projects must finish a job in full compliance with every planning condition. If an ordinary person wants a house, they must remove the front hedge and put up a gate but developers can get away with doing whatever they like. There are good developers and I know a number in Mullingar, but some do not finish estates, leave people in the lurch and expect the local authority to step in. If the House had adopted the Planning and Development Bill, and I do not know why it did not, it would have provided a remedy for people in the form of direct access to the courts and would have allowed local authorities to refuse planning permission for those who do not finish estates to specific conditions and in accordance with terms imposed on them. The onus would then be on the developer <Col N="1652"/>to go to court to prove the local authority was wrong not to grant planning. In the Planning and Development Act 2000 it is the other way round and people must endure the travails of the system before going to the High Court. It is a nonsense when somebody has deliberately and flagrantly breached the terms of a planning permission. Local authorities should do the job they are meant to do, which is taking in charge estates on behalf of the residents. It is a public service which should not be ceded to private individuals in the form of privatisation.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for raising this issue in Private Members&rsquo; time. A number of aspects in the motion are of particular concern in my constituency and I want to address a couple of them specifically. They relate to the management of multi-unit dwellings or apartment blocks. This category of development differs from those mainly made up of houses in that it would not usually be envisaged that a local authority would take in charge the common areas of an apartment block or the private or public open space which surrounds it.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the motion calls for the introduction of new legislation to give consumer protection to home-buyers, including the regulation of management charges. The motion also calls for new legislation to regulate the operation of management companies. Accordingly, I want to address these two specific issues which are of particular interest in my constituency where there is a large number of apartment blocks. Hardly a week goes by without one of my constituents, either a short-term tenant or a long-term leaseholder-owner of an apartment, contacting me about problems they must endure regarding the upkeep of the common part of their building. Again, rarely a week goes by without a constituent contacting me about the increasing cost and diminishing return in paying a management agent to manage the common parts of buildings containing apartments and the land which surrounds them.</P>
    <P>For example, some of my constituents contacted me the other week to complain that the management agent of their block is seeking a 50% increase in the management fee that they demanded last year. My constituents are reluctant to pay this fee hike because the management company and the management agent have not maintained the building as they should. In the past year, plants have been left to die, the grass areas are completely overgrown, they have become infested with weeds, no window cleaning has been done and the bin housing has not been cleaned adequately, the consequence of which is that vermin is proliferating all over the place. They promised a 24-hour a day management service, which is a complete myth. This only came to light when the fire alarm went off twice so far this year, in the middle of the night and no one <Col N="1653"/>responded to the calls to turn it off. The gutters are blocked, the water overflows on to the residents&rsquo; balconies, which is the source of the stagnant water and the awful smell in the lift. It took the management company a year to unveil the problem but it still has not been addressed.</P>
    <P>Recently I was in touch with another group of residents of an apartment block in my constituency who are suffering from a similar array of problems. The residents of these two developments have managed to use existing legislation to confront most of the difficulties they faced, and they managed to solve them. The question is what is wrong with the system if the problems can be solved using existing legislation. What is wrong is the expense and complexity of the solutions to these problems, which the residents of these two apartment blocks had been compelled to seek.</P>
    <P>I will describe the lengths to which they had to go. First, they had to get a lot of expensive legal advice. Thereafter, the residents, having used existing company law to have the current directors removed from the management company, compelled the management company to provide access to the accounts. In one of the cases that was brought to my attention the management company in question had not even bothered to draft accounts. In this instance, the residents were compelled to contact the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. They reported the management company&rsquo;s failure to hold annual general meetings and its failure to draft accounts.</P>
    <P>In another case, the residents had to contact the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to report that the management company, which was controlled by the developer, had failed to consult the shareholders of the management company, in reality, the residents, on the draft accounts. In addition, and again after much work, residents of one of the apartment complexes have managed to appoint their own representatives, again using provisions within the Companies Act, as directors on the board of directors of the management company. Having done all this, the residents succeeded in firing the managing agent, who was awful, and they have appointed a managing agent who is considerably better.</P>
    <P>However, what none of the residents who have been in contact with me succeeded in doing, using current legislation, is to force the developers to hand over ownership of the common parts to the residents. Even when resident-controlled management companies are maintaining the common parts of their apartment blocks, these companies are not always the legal owners of the areas they are maintaining and paying to maintain. The reality is that discovering and executing the solutions I have just described to the problems faced by the residents of apartment blocks in my constituency has required an enormous amount of work, a huge amount of money, a lot of patience and a vast degree of co-operation between the apartment owners.</P><Col N="1654"/>
    <P>We have an obligation as legislators, who are ultimately responsible for the legislation which provides the framework within which apartment developments are allowed, and their continued upkeep regulated, to provide a much easier means of resolving the problems the residents of apartment blocks constantly face. I would like, therefore, to outline some of the legislative solutions to the problems that apartment dwellers face. Deputy Penrose referred to some of these. First, planning permission should not be granted for an apartment building unless there is a condition attached to such a permission which compels developers of apartment blocks to form management companies and to grant shares in the company to all those who purchase units within it. Section 34(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 must be strengthened to include this specific stipulation.</P>
    <P>Second, there must be a planning condition imposed on developers that they complete satisfactorily within a specified period an apartment complex, regardless of whether the development includes two or more houses. I recommend that section 34<i>(f)</i> of the Planning and Development Act should be amended accordingly. These are suggestions that would help from a legislative point of view.</P>
    <P>Third, as soon as an apartment development is completed satisfactorily, ownership of the common parts must be handed over immediately to a management company. Too often my constituents tell me that developers are refusing ostensibly for one reason or another to hand over ownership of the common parts of an apartment complex. Suddenly, the developer applies for planning permission to add an extra storey to a block, and we then know the reason the developer was so reluctant in the first place to hand over ownership of the common parts.</P>
    <P>The amending of section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 would offer a mechanism for doing this. It would enable management companies, upon application to the court by a simple majority of individual property owners, that is, such an amendment must be drafted in such a way as to prevent a developer thwarting the desires of residents to take control of the common parts of their apartment complex, simply by retaining ownership of the apartments within that complex, to gain ownership of the common parts of the apartment complex.</P>
    <P>Fourth, developers must not be allowed to take control of apartment complex management companies. In Britain, which has a much longer history of dealing with multi-unit apartment blocks, the solution which has emerged is the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002. In that Act, a right to manage was established which is vested in residents of multi-unit apartment blocks. To exercise that right, residents of buildings within two or more units do not even have to apply to the court. They simply have to serve notice to manage on the developer or the owner <Col N="1655"/>of the common parts of an apartment complex. The notice to manage provides that the residents concerned wish to manage the property instead of the freeholder or developer and they have the right to set up a right to manage company for the purpose of doing so.</P>
    <P>To exercise this new right to manage, residents do not even have to say that the developer is mismanaging the property. However, if the property is being mismanaged, which is clearly the case in the examples I have given, the residents can apply to the court to have the developer&rsquo;s interest in the property vested in the residents. In practice, the mere existence of this legislation on the Statute Book in the UK has led to a significant improvement in the conduct of managing agents, management companies and developers. Not for the first time has a parliament managed to change the behaviour of those subjected to its laws merely by providing an easy and cheap method of recourse to those wronged.</P>
    <P>Together, these four legislative solutions could be provided by this House without much delay and they would have a profound impact on the lives of apartment dwellers throughout the country. I ask the House to support the motion.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify some points that were made during the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about section 180 of the 2000 Act, saying that local authorities were using it to refuse to take estates in charge when there is a management company in place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made clear, in our opinion section 180 is clear. It does not refer to management companies.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was as good at listening as he is at talking, the Minister of State might have got the story right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In our opinion the existence of a management company for a development should not override the legal obligation on developers to complete and maintain estates until they are taken in charge. We have heard that some local authorities have been attaching conditions beyond what is allowed by the law and we have commenced a survey to ascertain what is happening. It is not acceptable that this should be happening for traditional housing estates. Planning law should be applied in a consistent manner. We are researching what is happening.</P>
    <P>Local councillors have some responsibility. Deputy Penrose said councillors have been vigil<Col N="1656"/>ant in Westmeath but that is the responsibility of every councillor on every council. Last night Deputy Stagg mentioned Kildare County Council and how it seems to have gone off on a tangent.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>Planning is an executive function.</P>

   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The councillors in Kildare will have an opportunity to do that and to shape things to a more satisfactory extent when the report of the sub-committee they have established comes back.</P>
    <P>We cannot just walk away from this. We all have a responsibility to do what we must. The Law Reform Commission has been asked to provide a report on the legal issues relating to management companies and it would be premature to propose amendments to legislation at this stage. I hear what Deputy Upton says and will examine the points she makes, but when we have asked the Law Reform Commission to give us legal opinion on this, it would be our opinion that to move now would be premature. The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have given a guarantee that as soon as the report is published by the Law Reform Commission, we will act on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will ignore it like it does every other report.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not because we realise there are inconsistencies and the Kildare cases prove that.</P>

	<P>Will the Government stop them in the meantime?</P>

	<P>We are carrying out a survey to see exactly what is happening. The law applies to us all. It is clear and should be applied. If people are trying to evade it, we should identify them and take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Apartment living is relatively new and we must adjust to it and get our laws in order. The Government has and will continue to take the necessary action. We have given local authorities the power to deal properly with housing estates and to take them in charge.</P><Col N="1657"/><?oasys _cl11.6- ?>
    <P>Going back to the Bill that was proposed last year, I hear what Deputy Penrose is saying.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with what the Minister of State had to say. He is particularly familiar with Fingal County Council and he and I have discussed this issue with the manager some time ago.</P>
    <P>The development of the affordable housing programme, especially in the Fingal County Council area, has given an opportunity to many people to acquire a home of their own and developments, particularly in areas such as Tyrellstown and Castlecurragh, have proved very popular. Many young couples, however, find that having acquired their dream home, there is a hidden clause in the deal &mdash; a management company to which they are signed up when they agree to buy the house.</P>
    <P>This management company, typically in the direct charge of the developer, the developer&rsquo;s brother or the foreman&rsquo;s son, then proceeds to levy a charge ranging between &euro;400 and &euro;1,200 per household for keeping the estate in order. Many young couples are outraged to find that unbeknown to them, they have signed an apparently legally compelling condition to pay this charge.</P>
    <P>In Fingal County Council in a number of developments, for example, at Hillbrook and Castlecurragh, the council offered a package deal to purchasers whereby the council&rsquo;s solicitor acted as solicitor for the purchasers. This was done obviously to save money and on the face of it was a very attractive option. The downside, however, is that when queries arise later, there is very little recourse to the solicitor who is acting for two of <Col N="1658"/>the parties to the transaction and there is a clear conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>As a result of the legal arrangements with solicitors acting for both the council and purchasers, many purchasers have not seen the detailed legal agreement that they have entered into in purchasing their house. In one case in west Dublin where issues have arisen about the quality of the gas central heating and problems with condensation and other elements of the finish of the houses, many of the purchasers had no copy of the contract agreement. It was held by the council as the mortgage holder or arranger and residents had to contact the council repeatedly to get the information. In such a case, the management company was useless in assisting residents being still under the control of the developer. The developer had built the affordable houses as a fulfilment for the social and affordable housing he had been required to provide for a development some miles away in Castleknock. When some residents eventually sought separate legal representation, the council stopped responding to them and me, claiming that the matter was now in a legal process and it could not comment. That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>County councils are not advising purchasers of the obligations they are signing up to. There is a view that once houses maintain their capital value and perhaps increase in capital value, purchasers cannot complain. This misses the point entirely that this is a new form of arrangement which most people know little or nothing about. Councils are abusing their dominant position by failing to advise purchasers properly and there is no transparency in the arrangements. Those councils have a duty of care to purchasers, particularly the solicitors. This is a matter the Incorporated Law Society should examine as the purchase of a house is the biggest purchase that most people make in their lives.</P>
    <P>The development of the management company has become a substitute for the taking in charge of estates. It is galling for new purchasers of houses to find that they may be paying up to &euro;1,200 a year for looking after their estate while affluent older estates have the same services provided by the local authority. This is another stealth tax and it is part of the ongoing conspiracy between the Government, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, and their friends in the building industry to continue the rip-off of home buyers. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has failed to clarify why the taking in charge procedures are being abandoned. The only explanation is that it is a back door to privatising essential services and imposing stealth charges on new home owners.</P>
    <P>Last June there were major problems with the contamination of the water supply at Tyrellstown in Dublin 15. Following lengthy correspondence and discussions, the county council finally admit<Col N="1659"/>ted to me that the water supply to this large development of more than 2,000 homes, which were occupied, was under the control of the developer and the management company. The lids of the holding tanks within the estate contaminated the water and the council had no control over this, except under public health legislation, because its water supply was not contaminated. As a result, tankers delivered water to the householders for a few weeks. It is outrageous and potentially dangerous if we must rely for water on developers and builders and not on the public authorities to whom we pay our taxes. The same applies to the green areas, roads and public lighting. Why should these areas not continue to be taken in charge by the local authority?</P>
    <P>I appreciate management companies may well be appropriate in respect of apartment complexes, duplexes and triplexes which share a common roof and common internal and external spaces, as Deputy Upton has discussed at length. However, this should be done on a co-operative basis, as happens in many other countries, including the USA where home owners run their own apartment blocks. They make provision for investment or sinking funds and the long-term maintenance of apartment blocks such as roof repairs and repainting the building every few years.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has introduced a Bill to provide for the modernisation of the taking in charge process to compel builders to finish off estates properly. The planning process would also be empowered to take into account a developer&rsquo;s previous record on finishing estates before giving him planning permission to commence a new development. The Government has accepted the Bill in principle but has left it in the parliamentary equivalent of Siberia and we await the day the Government allows the Bill to proceed.</P>
    <P>The development of management companies has implications for conveyancing when houses come up for sale. Significant legal problems are mounting. There is a great deal of confusion, including when home owners opt to remortgage to finance improvements. They are subject to the clawback but it has emerged that, legally, the clawback is on the mortgage initiated by the county council, not on the sale of property. The Minister of State will have to sort this out legally. If one remortgages one&rsquo;s home to obtain extra finance, one must redeem the original mortgage and pay the clawback before engaging in home improvements. It is a surprise when people find this out.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed by the Government&rsquo;s pathetic response to the reasonable arguments put forward by the Labour Party to address this problem. The Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government <Col N="1660"/>say Fianna F&aacute;il agrees people in traditional houses should not face management charges but they refuse to do anything about it. The Minister is commissioning another set of reports from local authorities and is waiting on a Law Reform Commission report. All this could take years following which the Minister could leave them on the shelf, like all the other reports. In the meantime, many home owners are being abused by management companies. The only beneficiaries in this process are Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s friends in the building and development industry. Once again, if there is a choice between house buyers and the building industry, Fianna F&aacute;il can be trusted to always pick the builders.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate, especially those who will support the Labour Party in the division later. This straightforward problem is faced by many householders. It has been raised in the House so that it can be resolved and not for the purpose of political point scoring. The Labour Party has put a number of proposals to the Government to solve the problem and I am disappointed the Government has chosen not to accept the motion, which it could have done without great difficulty. However, insult is added to injury by the Government taking the opportunity presented by a motion dealing with a problem experienced by people who pay expensive management charges on housing estates and in apartment blocks to introduce a pathetic amendment, which relates to nothing more than a self-serving, self-congratulating list of statements.</P>
    <P>In response to a motion about management charges, the Government claps itself on the back. The amendment refers to how much choice householders have. What choice have those who cannot buy a home in the first place? It also refers to high quality urban design, environmentally progressive and energy efficient measures, but the Government is presiding over the building of the slums of tomorrow and is betraying the environment.</P>
    <P>The Ministers responsible for drafting the motion should take on board the contributions of their backbenchers, including Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Haughey, chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The amendment mentions the range of services provided and the additional houses being built and asks the House to congratulate the Government on the increase in the environment Vote in the Estimates. That is the Government&rsquo;s response to a problem raised in the House by the Labour Party. The Government claps itself on the back for initiatives for which it does not deserve credit and then avoids responsibility by saying the Law Reform Commission will examine the problem and local authority members are responsible in the first place.</P><Col N="1661"/>
    <P>This issue can be resolved by the Minister. If, as he maintains, local authorities are acting outside the law, he can put that right by issuing a policy directive to local authorities to get them back on side and prevent them from setting planning conditions for future planning permissions, which require the setting up of management companies and the charging of management fees. He does not have to conduct a survey, await a report of the Law Reform Commission or plead with councillors. He has the power to issue a policy directive, with which local authorities must comply. He can end this practice tomorrow morning by issuing such a directive, which is the first action the motion calls on him to take.</P>
    <P>I refer to the second action the Government can take. The Minister of State referred to the difference between apartment blocks and housing estates. The Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Minister agree the condition for management companies should not apply to housing estates. However, a remedy is open to them. The Minister can issue a policy guideline under the Planning and Development Act 2000, which distinguishes between apartment blocks and housing estates and between services that should be taken in charge, such as roads, water, sewerage, open spaces and public lighting, and those appropriate to private management companies such as maintenance within the curtilage.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State do that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to section 180 of the Act. The Minister stated in his contribution that this section will solve the problem.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fraud.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>He stated that all the people who live on estates that are subject to management charges have to do is request the local authority to conduct a plebiscite and if a majority of householders state they want the local authority to take the estate in charge, the local authority must do so. We will put the Government to the test on that. We will ask every Labour Party councillor in the country to table motions in every local authority requiring the local authority to conduct that plebiscite in each of the estates where these management companies exist and where there is concern about them. If it turns out that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is correct, that is fine, but if it turns out that there are problems with section 180 such as Deputy Murphy and I identified last night, we will come back to the House and wrap this issue around the neck of the Minister of State and that of the Minister.</P>

	<P>Along with my colleagues I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue of immense concern in the Cork and Kerry region. The depth of the concern can be gauged by proceedings in the House yesterday. It is necessary to place on the record the vehemence of the anger of public representatives from the Cork area not only about the nature of the quality of cancer care services in the Cork and Kerry region but also the pathetic Government response that we received to a number of inquiries about the service over several years. When listening to the Taoiseach yesterday outlining a series of national statistics, we and the people we represent were meant to take some solace from the fact that one medical oncologist on call representing four hospitals serving a population of 500,000 people is somehow commensurate with the average cancer care service in the country and in particular with those in the nation&rsquo;s capital.</P>
    <P>Cork has one noteworthy aspect in terms of cancer policy. It is the location of the National <Col N="1666"/>Cancer Registry, a dubious honour, which is more administrative than anything else. That registry points out that for several cancers the Cork and Kerry area is above the national average. Not only must we put up with the existence of such clusters among the people we represent, we also must put up with a sub-standard health service in trying to identify the degree of incidence of cancer in the area and how such cancers can be treated.</P>
    <P>Those of us on the Opposition side of the House are not prepared to put up with this type of cant and hypocrisy any longer. The Government cannot hide behind a shield of statistics. The type of responses given by the Taoiseach and the absence of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children from this Adjournment debate offers us no solace that the Government is dealing with the issue with any seriousness.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the people we represent continue to ask why even basic screening services such as BreastCheck, first promised before the general election of 2002, is now uncertain to be in place by the next milestone of 2007. As a Deputy for the Cork area I would like to know why at the end of November 2005 no planning application has been made to renovate the building identified to provide BreastCheck services in 2007. If that planning permission has not been sought, how can we even hope to come close to meeting the deadline for having such services available in the Cork area by 2007? This is beside the fact that the Government has chosen to roll out this programme to 50% of the country while the other <Col N="1667"/>50% can continue to wait. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister of State speaks, his contribution will represent an engagement and a reaction to what he will hear from my colleagues and me. I will not accept a prepared script written in the Department of Health and <?oasys _ch?>Children. We need to see appropriate action.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The letter from Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, which was published in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i> was unprecedented, just as was last week&rsquo;s protest by 36 general practitioners in the grounds of Kerry General Hospital. The number of malignant cancers diagnosed in residents of Kerry in 2001, the latest year for which we have official figures, was 522 &mdash; 249 females and 273 males. Breast cancer with 74 cases was the predominant cancer type among women while prostate cancer was the most predominant among men with 76 cases. Estimated figures for 2002 and 2003 are 569 and 598, respectively. These figures represent a substantial increase of 22.7% over the total for 1994 when 462 people were diagnosed with cancer.</P>
    <P>Recipients of cancer services in Kerry are also very much affected by the level of service in Cork. Since the resignation of Dr. Breathnach, a temporary oncologist visits Kerry General Hospital each fortnight. He is so overworked that he is unable to see all the patients during his visit and consequently they must either wait a further two weeks or go to Cork to be seen. Kerry General Hospital has no oncology beds for inpatients. Patients must be accommodated in general medical and surgical wards in the hospital. These wards are simply not suitable for oncology patients and certainly do not represent best practice. Although the hospital has a palliative care consultant, it has no beds for people dying of cancer and they are also accommodated in general medical and surgical wards.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While a day ward to accommodate day procedures was built and equipped five years ago, as it is not staffed it remains unopened. A high dependency surgical unit also remains closed and lies idle in the hospital. While it is fully equipped, the hospital has no staff to run it. In winter when the intensive care unit is overstretched, many patients, especially those suffering from bowel cancer, whose surgery is cancelled owing to the lack of beds in the intensive care unit could be accommodated in the high dependency surgical unit. Recently the sod was turned for a day care hospice unit in the grounds of Kerry General Hospital. However, this will be substantially funded by the people of Kerry and the committee will need to take out a substantial loan to build it. The Health Service Executive will only provide &euro;500,000 of the total budget of &euro;3.5 million.</P><Col N="1668"/>
 
    <P>Last year 3,000 patient visits were made to the oncology day unit at Kerry General Hospital and more than 800 new cancer patients were seen in the Cork and Kerry region. Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly, who is now the only consultant medical oncologist serving a population of 500,000, following the departure of Dr. Breathnach, feels the region needs four consultants rather than two.</P>
    <P>If BreastCheck was available to women in Kerry, the number of people visiting Kerry General Hospital would be much higher. In the counties where BreastCheck was rolled out 90% of women between the ages of 50 and 64 who were called for a mammogram attended the clinic. Evidence suggests that mammograms every two years reduce breast cancer rates by up to 30%. If the service was rolled out in Kerry, 10,000 women would be eligible for free screening and I am sure more people would be diagnosed with cancer.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the early detection of cancer by screening is one of the strategic areas of cancer prevention. Treatment in County Kerry is symptomatic, because women are only treated when their general practitioner refers them for a mammogram to Kerry General Hospital, following the discovery of a lump. There are no screening services in the county. As Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly pointed out in his letter to the Minister, women in Kerry and Cork are subjected to more extensive surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal treatment because of late detection.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to arrange that a consultant oncologist be provided on a weekly visit basis to Tralee General Hospital because of the increasing level of cancer in the county. We also need a day ward and staff immediately to accommodate day procedures. Finally, the Kerry-Cork region needs four consultant oncologists, not just two.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this serious issue tonight. I am staggered and amazed that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is not here to answer the questions being raised by the elected Members of the people of Cork and Kerry. Her absence shows both arrogance and contempt for those people. Effectively, she is giving the two fingers to the fears, anxieties, worries and concerns of the people of the region, who are very upset by what was disclosed through the letter of Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly on last Monday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>.</P>
    <P>That letter outlined in graphic detail the crisis in cancer care in the Munster region and the ongoing delays in rolling out the national breast cancer screening programme in south Munster. The details of the letter were upsetting and disturbing, but not surprising because many of us involved in public life have been aware of the appalling and unacceptable situation for quite some time, right across the services. Many of us <Col N="1669"/>have raised these matters in the D&aacute;il on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government has attempted to place the heavy hand of secrecy on the details of how our health services operate. The abolition of the health boards and the axing of public representatives from the health services have helped create a veil of secrecy over much of what is happening.</P>
    <P>The fact that a consultant oncologist working for a population of half a million people had to write to the Minister for Health and Children shows how desperate the situation is. To add insult to injury, the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday, in response to serious questions posed to him by the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, tried to defend the indefensible and attempted to explain away his Government&rsquo;s appalling record of undelivered promises in the southern region.</P>
    <P>Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s letter stated that patients had been left to die at home because there is no room for them in hospitals, and when in hospitals they have been subjected to third world conditions. The Taoiseach also tried to rubbish my claim that there is a two-year waiting list for mammograms. If I have time I will read into the record a letter I received this week from the director of hospital services in the southern region to a parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister for Health and Children about a particular patient. The T&aacute;naiste did not reply to the question, but passed the buck to the Health Service Executive from which I got a response much later. I was aware that the person, who had been referred for a mammogram by her general practitioner, had been told that she would have to wait two years for her mammogram. The response to my question confirmed that.</P>
    <P>This highlights again the apartheid that exists in our health services where, if people can pay, they will get almost immediate attention, even in our public hospitals. However, if they are, unfortunately, dependent on the public health service, they will be told to wait in line, often for many years. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children must explain the long delay in introducing the BreastCheck programme in the southern region. Unfortunately, she is not here this evening, although I would have expected her to be. She must publicly state that she accepts personal responsibility as Minister for Health and Children for the appalling conditions described by Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly. She should be here to apologise publicly to the families who have lost loved ones and those who have suffered severely because of the inadequacies in the services described by Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly. In accepting full responsibility for what has happened, she should set out a definite timetable for the upgrading of the services.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must also, during his visit to Cork next weekend, meet Dr. Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly so that he can hear at first hand the details of the upsetting conditions at the Cork University Hospital. A meeting with Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly would <Col N="1670"/>bring the Taoiseach back to reality as he is at present living in a world of spin and denial that comes from being too long in high office.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I do not have time to read into the record the contents of the letter I mentioned, but it is available for scrutiny, if anybody wishes to read it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the co-operation of everybody involved in trying to get this debate tonight. There were scenes in the D&aacute;il yesterday that would not achieve anything, so it is important that we have come here to highlight in a calm and rational manner the concerns of people and members of the broader public.</P>
    <P>Health is an emotive issue, but when dealing with cancer and the suffering of patients and their loved ones and families there is huge distress and concern. It is important that we outline a clear defined strategy or timetables for what we want to achieve. If our objectives are not achieved, the reasons must be outlined. For example, one must ask why Dr. Breathnach resigned and why we are unable to fill that post with a full-time consultant oncologist instead of the locum there currently. These questions must be asked and answers provided. One of the major problems is that there is much obfuscation with regard to services and many people highlight issues on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. We need a defined and clear strategy to outline what we have achieved to date and where we want to go. People have genuine concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are several issues at stake with regard to cancer treatment and care. I know the cardiac-renal-oncology unit has got the go-ahead, but the majority of people are not aware of that. From what I can gather, even Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly was not aware of that. Is there a breakdown in communications or do people just not want to hear what is happening? When we make decisions we must outline how long it will be before they are implemented and the service is provided to the public. Everybody in the health service must be provided with this information. I am amazed that the senior consultant oncologist was not made aware or did not know that funding had been made available for the cardiac-renal-oncology unit. The provision of information is a major step in trying to address many of the problems we have in the former southern health board region with regard to cancer care.</P>
    <P>There are also major concerns with regard to BreastCheck. I know the roll-out is happening and that the Department has secured the international training site and planning permission will soon be sought for it. There is progress. Everybody accepts that we cannot roll out the full BreastCheck system nationally in a matter of weeks. It takes time. Personnel must be put in place and planning permission for buildings etc. must be secured.</P>
    <P>The delivery of projects is another issue we must address. It takes a long time from the time <Col N="1671"/>of the decision to arrange funding, design, tender and final construction of facilities. Surely there should be some mechanism in place for major projects of critical importance to people&rsquo;s lives to be fast-tracked. We fast-track roads and various other projects, but there seems to be a delay process with regard to health projects. Is there any mechanism by which we can use hospital grounds already available for a fast-track approach to securing planning permission? There is concern about these issues and while I accept that the Opposition must raise genuine concerns, people should not try to confuse the issue.</P>
    <P>A deadline of 2007 was set for the roll-out of BreastCheck and the programme was originally announced in 1999. It was never envisaged that it would be completed in a matter of years. It was stated a number of years ago that it would be in Cork by 2007. Government Deputies took a great deal of political heat in that regard because people were very concerned about screening for breast cancer, just as they are concerned now about screening for cervical cancer. People know that if preventative treatment is available or if cancer can be detected in time, there will not be such a high level of demand for forms of intervention like radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery. There are genuine concerns in this regard.</P>
    <P>Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s letter has highlighted many issues. We can debate whether some of the statements in the letter, such as those relating to the renal and cardiac oncology unit, are factually accurate. Dr. O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s comments have raised legitimate concerns. I welcome this debate. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, will give us details of a positive and clearly defined strategy so that we can return to Cork to tell the people exactly what has happened and what will happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is long overdue. It is a shame that what happened yesterday had to occur to enable this debate to take place. Not enough time has been allocated to allow Members to speak about all the things that are wrong with the health service in counties Cork and Kerry. As Deputy Kelleher said, it seems that certain people do not want to hear a message of frustration, delay, procrastination and promises which have not been fulfilled. We need to take a serious look at what is happening. The Minister for Health and Children received a letter from a consultant in a very sensitive area. I am sure the man in question had more to do than write lengthy letters about matters of concern to him, but he felt compelled to write the letter I have mentioned nonetheless. He said in the letter that he has to treat his patients in conditions which are so bad that he was compelled to write a damning letter to the Minister, who did not respond other than to say that some aspects of the letter were factually incorrect. I do not think the letter was factually incorrect.</P><Col N="1672"/>
    <P>The manager of Cork University Hospital said on this evening&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; that a planning application for the BreastCheck facility at the hospital will be made early in the new year. That news will come as a surprise to some women in Cork who have been campaigning for the BreastCheck service to be rolled out there, because it was made clear to them in June of this year that the schedule that had to be met if BreastCheck was to be rolled out in 2007 would not be met if a planning application for BreastCheck was not made by October. The clear commitment to make the application by October so that the facility would be up and running by 2007 was made after a group of women in Cork, who are annoyed by the apartheid in Irish life that means the BreastCheck service is not available to them, picketed the annual general conference of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House why the health of women in Leinster is more important that the health of women in Munster? It defies logic. The roll-out of the BreastCheck programme has been announced three times. The commencement date of 2007 was mentioned for the first time when the current Minister, Deputy Harney, took office. The women of Munster should bear in mind that the plans for the roll-out of the BreastCheck service are three months behind schedule.</P>
    <P>I would like to tell the House why I was so annoyed yesterday. I spent all day Monday and most of Tuesday telephoning Cork University Hospital to try to get a bed for an extremely ill man who has been waiting for weeks to get a bed. His consultant said he should be given a bed, his wife was at her wit&rsquo;s end and his general practitioner was doing all he could, but they still needed to contact some politicians. One would not imagine that there would have been any difficulty, given that the man was at the top of the priority list, but he could not get a bed because there is a shortage of bed capacity in Cork University Hospital and the people in the accident and emergency department who were on trolleys needed to be cleared first. I learned just before I came to the House yesterday that the hospital authorities had found a bed for the man in question, for which great credit is due to them. The family of the man will always be grateful for their assistance. The success in that case is beside the point, however, because there are hundreds of similar cases throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the richest country in Europe, but it has the worst health service in Europe. The Minister for Health and Children continues to tell us it is not her responsibility, but it is very much her responsibility &mdash; that is what she gets paid for and what she is given the glory for. It is her job. I ask the Minister to get the finger out for the sake of the people waiting for beds, including those on trolleys, and especially the approximately 60 women who die every year in preventable circumstances. She needs to put in place the kind of <Col N="1673"/>health service that the people who created the Celtic tiger deserve and to which they are entitled.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to set out the current position in respect of oncology services in the southern area and to respond to the issues raised by the Deputies. I do not intend to defend or to attempt to defend the provision of inappropriate care for cancer patients, who are entitled to quality cancer care regardless of whether they live in the southern region of the HSE or elsewhere. The T&aacute;naiste shares the Government&rsquo;s objective of continuing to invest in the development of cancer services. I intend to set out details of the significant investment in such services in the southern region. It is important to stress to the House that the issues raised by Deputies Boyle, Deenihan, Allen, Kelleher and Lynch relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. This is fully consistent with the legislation, which was approved by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is important that the House is made aware of the full picture, in fairness to the service providers, those working with cancer patients and cancer patients themselves. The initiatives to which I will refer reflect significant work by health service employees who are fully committed to the provision of good and effective cancer care. The HSE issued a statement yesterday summarising such developments. I emphasise that all the issues outlined are being addressed within the region through the appropriate management and governance structures which have been established and are acceptable to management and clinical staff. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, approximately &euro;80 million cumulative additional funding has been made available to the southern region with an additional 11 consultants and 44 clinical nurse specialists being appointed across the region.</P>
    <P>The Department has been advised by the HSE that approval was granted two weeks ago to proceed to the next phase of development for the &euro;47 million oncology, cardiac and renal unit which includes a dedicated 30-bed oncology ward. The advertisements have been placed in the <i>EU Journal</i> for builders to apply for inclusion on a list of those to be invited to tender for the construction of the new unit and it is planned to commence construction in mid-2006. Arrangements are also being made at present to establish a ten-<Col N="1674"/>bed medical oncology ward within Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>A range of oncology services are provided at hospitals in counties Cork and Kerry. The consultant appointments in the oncology area since 1997 include two consultant medical oncologists with sessional commitments to CUH, the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital and the Mercy University Hospital, one filled on a locum basis pending the permanent filling of same; one additional consultant radiation oncologist and a second post re-advertised; two consultant surgeons with a special interest in breast disease, one at CUH and one at the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital; one consultant radiologist with a special interest in breast imaging at CUH; three consultant histopathologists, two at CUH and one at the Mercy University Hospital; and one consultant haematologist at CUH-Mercy University Hospital-Kerry General Hospital.</P>
    <P>This year alone, the following posts have been approved for the HSE southern area and are in the process of being filled: one consultant surgeon with a special interest in colorectal surgery; one consultant plastic surgeon with a special interest in breast reconstruction; one consultant respiratory physician; one consultant in palliative care; and one consultant paediatric haematologist. This investment in Cork University Hospital has resulted in the following treatments in the first ten months of this year: more than 16,000 radiotherapy treatments; more than 3,300 day and inpatient haematology cases treated; and more than 4,000 day and inpatient oncology cases treated.</P>
    <P>Affirmation of the quality of cancer care at CUH was evidenced by the fact that the hospital was named earlier this year as Ireland&rsquo;s first and only designated centre in integrated oncology and palliative care. CUH is one of only eight centres in Europe chosen to receive this designation from the European Society for Medical Oncology for the excellence of its supportive treatment for cancer patients.</P>
    <P>In Kerry General Hospital, activity figures for the first ten months of this year include almost 2,500 chemotherapy day cases treated; 1,700 breast care OPD clinics with access to mammography, ultrasound and other diagnostic facilities; and more than 700 gynaecology-colposcopy day cases treated.</P>
    <P>In 2004, approval was granted for &euro;3 million full year funding and additional staff to expand radiation oncology capacity at CUH. I understand that the third linear accelerator commenced treatment in March 2005 and the fourth commenced treatment in October. Twenty-nine additional staff have been recruited for this service, including a third consultant radiation oncologist. A fourth consultant radiation oncologist post for this unit has been advertised.</P>
    <P>The expansion of radiation oncology services under the national plan announced by the T&aacute;naiste last July will increase the number of <Col N="1675"/><?oasys _ch?>linear accelerators from four to seven and will greatly improve access for cancer patients throughout the southern region to radiotherapy treatment. I am also aware that an order has been signed for a picture archiving communications system which will assist inpatient services communications in CUH.</P>
    <P>Planning is under way for the development of the necessary infrastructure for the national roll-out of the BreastCheck programme. BreastCheck recently advertised for key lead consultant radiologists and radiographers for the programme and the recruitment of other key clinical posts will commence early in 2006. BreastCheck is confident that the roll-out of the programme will commence in 2007. When the programme is rolled out, mobile units will be available to screen eligible women in the 50 to 64 age group throughout the southern area. This investment will ensure that screening and follow-up treatment is available to approximately 72,000 women throughout the southern region, including approximately 34,000 women in County Cork.</P>
    <P>The HSE southern area is developing a regional hospital group comprising all acute hospitals in the area to ensure the delivery of a unified service. The new network structure will give acute hospitals the opportunity to work together to provide the best possible cancer <Col N="1676"/>services for the communities they serve. It is my understanding that a meeting has been arranged between the HSE and Professor Paul Redmond, director of cancer services in the southern area, to discuss the further development of cancer services.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the developments I outlined are as a result of good planning within the hospitals in the region and are based significantly on the efforts of the regional cancer director. He has used his office to progress these developments in the interests of cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The T&aacute;naiste has made an allocation in the 2006 Estimates of an additional &euro;9 million to the HSE to continue to meet the additional service pressures in cancer care, improve the quality of care, facilitate better access to radiation oncology services and continue the preparation for a national cervical screening programme. The Government remains committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in accordance with best international standards. We believe it is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care to patients. To this end, we will continue to provide considerable investment in oncology services in the coming years.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>if Ireland has contracted, or is planning to enter into, bilateral agreements with African states which would permit the return of third country nationals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it the Deputy is referring to readmission agreements with African countries involving reciprocal undertakings in relation to the return of illegal residents to their countries of origin and related immigration matters.</P>
    <P>Such agreements take two forms &mdash; bilateral agreements between Ireland and another country and agreements negotiated by the European Commission with third countries on behalf of member states. The latter form part of the European Union&rsquo;s broader aim of developing a balanced, coherent and common approach towards immigration and asylum.</P>
    <P>Nigeria is the only African country with which Ireland currently has a readmission agreement. A bilateral agreement on immigration matters, including readmission, was concluded in 2001 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. While the agreement has not yet been officially ratified by the Nigerian side, both sides are operating in the spirit of the agreement, particularly in the area of repatriation. I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 3, 14 and 60 on Thursday, 20 October 2005 for further details about this agreement.</P>
    <P>Between 2000 and 2002 the European Council mandated the Commission to negotiate readmission agreements with 11 third countries-entities on behalf of member states, including two north African countries, namely, Morocco, 2000, and Algeria, 2002.</P>
    <P>The Commission reports that negotiations with Morocco are well advanced and a draft agreement is expected to be agreed by the end of this year. Negotiations with Algeria are advancing at <Col N="1678"/>a slower pace with first round discussions expected to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Community readmission agreements fall within Title IV of the Treaty of the European Union, Amsterdam treaty, and therefore do not automatically apply to Ireland, or the UK. The specific approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas is required before Ireland can participate in such measures and a decision on participation in any agreements with Morocco and Algeria will be made when these negotiations have concluded.</P>
    <P>While the agreed procedures set out in readmission agreements greatly facilitate the smooth return of persons, the absence of such agreements does not prevent returns being made to other countries.</P>

	<P>The question of placing on a statutory basis the recording and use of the type of information referred to in the question which may be in the possession of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arises in the context of an examination being carried out in my Department concerning the placing of the Garda vetting unit procedures on a statutory basis. This is a comprehensive exercise which will take into account the legal and constitutional issues that will arise when deciding on the type of information that can be made available, and the circumstances in which it can be made available, by the vetting unit. I cannot give an accurate estimate at present as to when the examination will be complete.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>the reason the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 does not make provision for the introduction of payment in respect of parental leave.</Quest>
     <QRef>[31453/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 provides for a range of improvements to the existing parental leave legislation which will offer greater flexibility to working parents. The main provisions of the Bill are as follows: raising the maximum age of the eligible child from five to eight years; an increase in the maximum age of the eligible child to 16 years in the case of children with disabilities; extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting in <i>loco parentis</i> in respect of an eligible child; a <Col N="1679"/>statutory entitlement to take the 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks of a minimum of six continuous weeks, or more favourable terms with the agreement of the employer; an employee who falls ill while on parental leave and as a result is unable to care for the child may suspend the parental leave for the duration of the illness following which period the parental leave recommences.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing paid parental leave was considered by the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 in 2001 which was convened under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness social partnership agreement. However, the working group, which comprised representatives from the relevant Departments and the social partners, did not reach agreement on the principle of paid parental leave.</P>
    <P>In the course of the working group&rsquo;s deliberations, some members of the group expressed concerns in relation to the adoption of any new measures which would result in increased costs for employers, particularly small employers and the need to maintain international competitiveness. In subsequent negotiations on the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement, no agreement was made by the social partners on paid parental leave and the Government does not propose to introduce legislative change which one side of social partnership cannot accept. Consequently, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 makes no provision for paid parental leave.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as at 19 October 2005 was 574 &mdash; all ranks. A further seven garda&iacute; &mdash; all ranks &mdash; are attached to the Garda national traffic bureau based at Garda headquarters. The personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na includes personnel assigned to the Garda traffic corps. While the members of the traffic corps are specifically dedicated to traffic duties, all garda&iacute; have responsibility, to deal with, <i>inter alia</i>, traffic duties as they arise.</P>
    <P>Last November I announced the establishment by the Commissioner of a Garda traffic corps with a dedicated budget and staff structure. Furthermore, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s approval of my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members, the Garda Commissioner will be in a position, as each cycle of recruit training is completed, to assign additional new members to the areas of greatest <Col N="1680"/>need with particular regard to certain priorities. These priorities will include the traffic corps.</P>
    <P>The personnel strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stood at 12,301 &mdash; all ranks &mdash; on 19 November 2005. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200 on the following phased basis: 2006 &mdash; 805; 2007 &mdash; 1,030; 2008 &mdash;1,200.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. In this regard, a total of 1,125 trainee garda&iacute; were inducted into the Garda college to commence training during 2005. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. A further 2,200 student garda&iacute; will be recruited to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2006 and 2007, that is, 1,100 in each of those years.</P>

     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that even in the event of the extra 2,000 garda&iacute; promised, which have not as yet materialised, there will still remain a serious under-strength in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in view of the demographic changes that have taken place in the past number of years with particular reference to large areas of new urbanisation which does not have policing levels in keeping with the population increases and best practise in other jurisdictions; his proposals to increase Garda strength further to meet such requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35701/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I recall that in October 2004, the Government approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 in line with the commitment contained in An Agreed Programme for Government. I subsequently announced the time-table for implementation of the expansion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 at a press conference at Garda headquarters on 14 October 2004. The timetable published by me at that time showed clearly and unambiguously what was committed to, how it will be done and when it will be done.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the timetable for the expansion of the force, which takes into account the numbers likely to retire, is right on target. It will be delivered in full. The number of fully attested members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and recruits in training will exceed the figure of 14,000 in December 2006, only 13 months away, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008. The expansion of facilities at Templemore to facilitate the increased intakes is also taking place within the envisaged timeframe.</P>
    <P>I have also on two occasions amended the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations to broaden the eligibility criteria for entry to the force. This has resulted in an increase in the maximum age for entry to the force from 26 to 35 years of age, and more recently, changes which will give greater possibilities for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from members of ethnic and religious minorities to ensure that the composition of the force can be fully representative of the community it serves. The second recruitment competition under this accelerated programme is <Col N="1682"/>currently being processed by the Public Appointments Service in conjunction with Garda human resource management. This will provide a continuous stream of high quality Garda recruits to meet this ambitious programme of quarterly intakes of approximately 275 over the lifetime of this project.</P>
    <P>I note the party of which Deputy Durkan is a member did not give any commitment to increase the force in 1997 or 2002. Indeed when his party was last in Government the strength of the force actually decreased from 10,827 to 10,804. The proposal to increase the strength of the force to the level of 14,000 members took full account of &mdash; and indeed was in considerable part motivated by &mdash; projected population increases, particularly in growing urban areas. Taking into account projected population increase between now and 2008, the increase in the force strength to 14,000 members, which at over 16% will far exceed the increase in population, will yield a significant improvement in the police:population ratio.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific deployment of these very significant additional resources, both in growing urban areas and generally, the Garda Commissioner will target the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in An Agreed Programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact. In addition to the expansion of the force outlined above, I have separately outlined my intention to supplement further the operational capacity of the force by way of establishment of a voluntary Garda reserve, as provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. The purpose of the Garda reserve, which is a standard feature of policing in many other common law countries, will be to assist the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the performance of its functions. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to submit proposals to me for the reserve, addressing all relevant recruitment, training and development issues. As I announced in last week&rsquo;s Estimates, it is my objective that 900 members of the reserve will be recruited and trained by September 2006.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit tasked with the role of tackling organised crime. It carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units specifically, the national criminal intelligence unit, the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, headed by a chief superintendent, is a multi-agency unit comprising personnel drawn from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation has responsibility for the investigation of fraud-related crime on a national basis, including money laundering offences. The bureau&rsquo;s money-laundering investigation unit is actively involved in the recording, evaluation, analysis and investigation of disclosures relating to suspicious financial transactions.</P>
    <P>The following table summarises the total Garda strength of each of the Garda national units investigating serious crime as at 18 October 2005. The Revenue Commissioners continue to support the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in com<Col N="1684"/>bating organised crime, in particular through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau. In this regard, Revenue has recently assigned an additional officer to work full time with the bureau. Revenue has also established excellent co-operation with the relevant Garda National Units. This ensures that when Revenue&rsquo;s investigation, prosecution and enforcement activity, particularly in the areas of drugs and cigarette smuggling and oil frauds, identifies linkages to organised-gangland crime these are made known to the garda&iacute; and the individuals concerned are pursued with the financial, including illicit profits, and money-laundering aspects of their activities being fully explored.</P>
    <P>Revenue officers engaged in investigation, enforcement and prosecution related work are increasingly aware of and alert to the possibilities of identifying financially based criminal activity or linkages to it and of the need to liaise with and support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau in its work.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of murders in which firearms were used in respect of each year from 1998 to 2004 are set out in the following table. I am informed by the Garda authorities that murders involving the use of firearms tend to have lower conviction rates than other murders. This is not unique to Ireland. The number of violent deaths, murder and manslaughter, recorded in 2004 is 45, the lowest number recorded in ten years, despite our population increasing by 400,000 during the same period. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the highest priority is given by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the investigation of murders and the detection of those responsible.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the per<Col N="1685"/>formance of his functions and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions. Furthermore, judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. It would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions also.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be also aware, the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will <Col N="1686"/>enhance the powers of the garda&iacute; in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, I propose to bring forward, on Committee Stage, a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearms offences, including the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases. I will also introduce a new offence of illegally modifying a firearm by, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence.</P><Col N="1685"/>

    <P FLI="0">The last rainbow Government allowed the number of garda&iacute; to fall from 10,827 to 10,804 and neither Labour, Fine Gael nor the Green Party gave any commitment to increase the level in 1997 or 2002. Indeed, they criticise my proposal to increase the force to 14,000. The 2002 census of population calculated the national population at 3,917,203, giving a police:population ratio of 1:329. In 1996, the police:population ratio was calculated at 1:336.</P><Col N="1686"/>
    <P>As I publicly stated when announcing Government approval for my proposals in October 2004, the phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college this year and it is intended to induct 1,100 for the next two years, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. I should add that this accelerated recruitment process is fully on target.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of population increases over recent years and the proposal to increase the strength of the force to this level took full cognisance of &mdash; and indeed was in considerable part motivated by &mdash; projected population increases. Taking into account projected population increases, the increase in the force strength to 14,000 members will yield a very significant improvement in the police:population ratio.</P>

The scope of the Civil Legal Aid Act, which governs the work of the Legal Aid Board, is in fact broader than this and law centres undertake other civil law work, including medical and professional negligence cases, as well as contract and debt matters.</P>
    <P>In so far as resources are concerned, there has been a very substantial increase in the board&rsquo;s core funding this year to &euro;21.362 million and a further increase has been provided for 2006.

	<P>The Children Act 2001, which came into law in May 2002, gave a statutory basis to the Garda diversion programme, which includes a restorative justice aspect. This programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na responsible for administering the programme at the local level. I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the year 2003, the Garda national juvenile office received 19,915 referrals under the programme relating to 17,043 individual offenders. The number of juvenile referrals processed by the national juvenile office in 2004 was 20,607. Early assessments indicated a very high level of satisfaction from those involved in the process.</P>
    <P>The diversion programme is in place on a nationwide basis. Resource implications are constantly under review and applications for additional resources are made on a case by case basis when and where necessary. In addition to the programme, there are in existence more than 60 Garda youth diversion projects targeted towards at risk youngsters around the country.</P>
    <P>These Garda youth diversion projects, which along with the diversion programme operate under the aegis of the national juvenile office, are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative aimed at diverting young persons from becoming involved &mdash; or further involved &mdash; in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour, by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improv<Col N="1689"/>ing the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations. The number of such projects has grown from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present &mdash; a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000-06. I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of such projects. Proposals made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to my Department on establishing further projects are examined within the context of available resources.</P>
    <P>In publishing the details last week of the Abridged Estimates for 2006, I outlined a 14-point package of initiatives in line with the commitment of considerable additional financial resources to the Garda Vote. One of these initiatives involves an extra &euro;1.2 million to be allocated to the various youth diversion projects, bringing the total available for these highly successful interventions to &euro;6.6million. I have now asked the Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further community-based initiatives in this area in the light of the additional funding announced today. It is intended to extend further these schemes across the country over the next two years. The target is to have established 100 of these schemes nationwide by end 2007.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that in 1999 there were 84 garda&iacute; employed operationally as juvenile liaison officers, JLOs, in the various divisions throughout the country. Two additional posts have since been created in July 2004 and May 2005 to bring this number to 86, together with eight JLO sergeants. In addition, the national juvenile office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants. The administration in the office is carried out by these two sergeants and four civilian staff.</P>
    <P>The national juvenile office is one of four constituent elements that make up the national community relations section. As the annual budget for the national community relations section is not divided between the four units it is not possible to determine the 2005 budget for the national juvenile office. Furthermore, certain related expenditure items, such as the provision of motor vehicles, information technology and other support services, are accounted for on a centralised national basis. In addition, the salary costs of the 86 JLO garda&iacute; and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country are accounted for centrally within the Garda Vote and are not reflected in the above figure of &euro;2.75 million. Consequently it is not possible to provide, for any particular year, budget details on an individual Garda unit basis for those additional nationally provided services.</P>
    <P>Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research <Col N="1690"/>unit. All Garda juvenile liaison officers have received training in restorative justice and over half have received training in mediation skills. It is expected that the ongoing development of restorative justice within the diversion programme will lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of recidivism.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities and I remain strongly committed to the principle and practice of diversion in the criminal justice system, a commitment warranted by consistent findings of national and international criminological research. Although the Garda diversion programme and other youth diversion projects are not appropriate for all juveniles or in all situations, they nevertheless provide an important intervention in the lives of those juveniles who have taken a wrong turn in the process of maturing into young adults. Research indicates that of all those formally diverted from prosecution, some 88% do not come to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na again by their 18th birthday.</P>

	<P>Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve prospects of employability. The projects are funded by my Department and administered by the community relations section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Currently, 64 projects are being funded. In addition to the Garda youth diversion projects, there are seven mainstreamed local drugs task force projects which are associated with Garda youth diversion projects. They seek to educate and divert young people who are at risk of becoming involved in substance misuse. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the projects cater for approximately 2,500 participants per annum.</P>
    <P>Garda youth diversion projects are a tangible measure of crime prevention and reflect the commitment of my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to multi-agency partnerships in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level. The role of the youth diversion projects is to bring about conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through <Col N="1691"/>positive interventions and interaction with the project.</P>
    <P>The primary project target group, which forms the majority of project participants, are young people who have entered the Garda juvenile diversion programme and are considered at risk of remaining within the justice system.</P>
    <P>The secondary project target group are young people who, although they have not been officially cautioned, have come to the attention of the garda&iacute;, the community or local agencies as a result of their behaviour and are considered at risk of entering the justice system at a future date.</P>
    <P>My Department commissioned a study by TCD, The Impact and Effectiveness of the Garda Special Projects, Bowden and Higgins &mdash; May 2000. The study found that 83% of those participants surveyed reported that they had learned and 62.7% reported a personal change from their participation in the projects. The study commented that &ldquo;The positive impact that the projects have made overall does, of course, justify their retention provided that there is a shift to a more strategic approach.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following the recommendation of the report to provide a more strategic framework, my Department commissioned the centre for social and educational research at the Dublin Institute of Technology, Rathmines, to prepare comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of the projects. The guidelines were launched in May 2003 and are now fully operational.</P>
    <P>My Department also commissioned DIT to conduct an examination of risk factors with regard to the participants in the projects. The risk profile developed focuses on various aspects of the young people&rsquo;s lives, including socio-economic factors, young people&rsquo;s general life styles, young people&rsquo;s perception of education and their levels of educational attainment, the nature of young people&rsquo;s relationships with family and friends and history of offending.</P>
    <P>My Department is planning to commission a further study or survey of participants in Garda youth diversion projects in the near future. The purpose of the survey will be to ascertain the progression of participants in terms of recidivism and full time education.</P>
    <P>The budgetary allocation of funding for the 64 Garda youth diversion projects, together with the seven local drug task force projects, for 2005 is &euro;5.471 million. As part of my ongoing commitment to law enforcement and crime prevention, I have recently announced a new 14-point nationwide policing programme. I have secured an increase in funding of &euro;146 million for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2006. Some &euro;1.2 million of this additional funding is being allocated to Garda youth diversion schemes, bringing the total available to &euro;6.6 million. I have asked the Com<Col N="1692"/>missioner to bring forward proposals for further community based initiatives in this area in the light of the additional funding. It is my intention to further extend these schemes across the country over the next two years. The target is to have established 100 schemes by the end of 2007.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, that 1,914 recruits have graduated from the Garda college since 6 June 2002. I am further informed that a total of 1,525 members &mdash; all ranks &mdash; have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 6 June 2002. Garda management also states that a total of 2,078 recruits have been attested to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 6 June 2002.</P>
    <P>Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees become serving members of the force. Thus the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase three of their training but have not yet formally graduated &mdash; formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. The strength of the force has therefore increased by 553 members since June 2002.</P>
    <P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is still as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to <Col N="1693"/>14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. It is to continue to induct 1,100 recruits for each of the next two years, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that during the period 1 January to 31 October 2005, there were 26 road traffic fatalities in the Donegal Garda division. There were also 26 road traffic fatalities during the same period in 2004.</P>
    <P>In response to recent road traffic fatalities in the Inishowen area, the Garda Commissioner has set up a specialised dedicated traffic unit there. The unit, which is based in Burnfoot, commenced a three month pilot operation in the Donegal division on 20 October 2005. Thereafter it will be reviewed and evaluated to determine its degree of effectiveness. This unit has been established as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s commitment to road safety and is in addition to the traffic units located at Donegal Town and Letterkenny. Currently the Donegal divisional traffic unit comprises three sergeants and 23 garda&iacute; solely dedicated to traffic policing duties.

	<P>The Road Traffic Act 1994 provides that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may, where he or she is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, require that person to go to a Garda station and further require that person submit to a blood test or to provide a urine sample which will then be subject to analysis by the medical bureau of road safety. This applies to circumstances where a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is dealing with a person whose driving has been erratic. Dependent upon the circumstances, this sample will be analysed for alcohol and-or drugs.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the medical bureau of road safety, which is under the aegis of the Department of Transport, is keeping abreast of the development of devices which are being developed for the purpose of carrying out roadside drug testing.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 107 together.</P>
    <P>The grounds on which an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a person arriving in the State are set out in section 4(3) of the Immigration Act 2004. Some 3,732 persons were refused leave to enter the State at the country&rsquo;s ports of entry from 1 January 2005 to 31 October 2005. The main countries of origin of those refused entry during that period are as follows: Brazil, Nigeria, Romania, China and South Africa. Persons seeking asylum are not refused entry to the State. In accordance with section 9(1) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, any person making an application for asylum is given leave to enter the State.</P>

    <P FLI="0">The Deputy will be interested to note that on 17 November 2005 there was a total of 110 persons or 3% of the prison population on temporary release, excluding day release. The corresponding figure in October 1996 was 550 which accounted for 19% of the prison population at that time.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to replace outdated prison accommodation with new facilities which will eliminate the practice of slopping out and also seek to eliminate the practice of doubling up in cells which is prevalent throughout the system.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, I can confirm that a total of 150 new spaces are being provided in the new Portlaoise C block which is due to be completed in 2007. I can also advise the Deputy that estimates of future space requirements are being refined by the Irish Prison Service in the context of planning for the development of the new prison complexes at north county Dublin and Spike Island.</P>

	<P>In respect of the joint committee&rsquo;s final report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, the primary recommendations relate to the establishment of a further inquiry into certain aspects of the State&rsquo;s handling of the bombings. In response, the Government, with the Taoiseach as sponsoring Minister, established a Commission of Investigation, the work of which is ongoing.</P>
    <P>In respect of the joint committee&rsquo;s final report on the Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin Bombings of 1972 and 1973, chapter 12 sets our diverse recommendations and suggestions for any further necessary action. In respect of the relevant recommendations of the two reports, implementation, as appropriate, has occurred and is occurring, including: the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the establishment of implementation arrangements thereon; continued support for the forensic science laboratory; the ongoing development of departmental arrangements to facilitate comprehensive implementation of the National Archives Act 1986; the ongoing development of proposals for the establishment of a group of independent academics to advise on access to undisclosed files; and continued support for the Remembrance Commission.</P>

	<P>On foot of my proposal, which was made with the approval of the Minister for Finance, the Government decided yesterday that a commission of investigation should be established into the making of a confession by the late Dean Lyons about the tragic deaths of Ms Mary Callinan and Ms Sylvia Shiels in March 1997 in Grangegorman, Dublin 7.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will now be made to have the relevant draft order and statement of reasons for establishing the commission laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval as required by the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. Thereafter the order establishing the commission will be made by Government.</P>
    <P>While the formal terms of reference will be set by me once that process has been completed I intend to ask the commission to examine and report on the circumstances arising from the making of a confession by Dean Lyons, deceased, about the deaths of Ms Mary Callinan and Ms Sylvia Shiels in March 1997 in Grangegorman Dublin 7; the adequacy of the Garda assessment of the reliability of Mr. Lyons&rsquo;s confession, both before and after he was charged with murder; and the adequacy of information provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the morning of 27 July 1997 to the Director of Public Prosecutions and in particular whether any additional information should have been provided at that time. The commission will be headed by Mr. George Birmingham SC and will be independent with full statutory powers to summon witnesses and take sworn evidence.</P>
    <P>While the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference will focus on the specific circumstances of the Dean Lyons case I also intend to establish an expert group to conduct a more general review of relevant Garda practices, including training, protocols, regulations and procedures &mdash; as existed in 1997 and as exist now. I intend to publish the reports of both the commission and the expert group.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I should point out that in relation to divisional headquarters and the population figures, it must be noted that this relates to the resident population only and would not include people who socialise, shop or work in that city centre area.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be fully considered.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 86 together.</P>
    <P>The position is that section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provides for the making of regulations specifying particulars which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified to be affixed to containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption in off licensed premises.</P>
    <P>While the labelling of containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold with a view to combatting under-age consumption of intoxicating liquor is an attractive idea, significant challenges would need to be overcome in order to render it effective in practice. These challenges arise under two headings.</P>
    <P>Practical difficulties will be encountered where several individual containers are packaged together in advance for retail sale, for example, a six-pack of bottles; a plastic-wrapped tray of cans; or a nailed wooden box containing bottles of wine. This raises the important issue of whether identification labels should be attached at the point of sale or earlier in the distribution chain. Attaching labels at an earlier stage might be simpler but it could create logistical difficulties for importers and distributors and this would lead in turn to increased distribution costs. Moreover, in the case of imports from other EU member states, it is likely that such additional labelling requirements would be regarded as infringing internal market rules.</P>
    <P>From an enforcement perspective it is clear that possession by an underage person of a labelled container does not in itself constitute proof that the intoxicating liquor in the container had been illegally supplied to that person by the licensee whose particulars appear on the container. It may have been taken from the family home or have been sold to a person over the age of 18 in good faith by the licensee before being passed on to the underage person. Indeed, a labelled container may have passed through several hands before finding its way into the hands of an underage person.</P>
    <P>Issues relating to the evidential value of being found in possession of a labelled container were raised during consultations on implementation of section 22 of the 2003 Act and my Department subsequently raised them with the Office of the Attorney General. The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of being in possession of a labelled container and doubt is, therefore, cast on the utility of any regulations that might be made under section 22 of the 2003 Act.</P><Col N="1702"/>
    <P>One option that could possibly be considered in the context of future legislation would be a presumption that any intoxicating liquor container found in the possession of an underage person had been purchased by that person from the licensee identified on the container until the contrary was proved. However, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office has also advised that such a proposal would raise serious constitutional issues and would run the significant risk of being found to be inconsistent with Article 38 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I do not, as I have already stated on a number of occasions, intend to make regulations under section 22 of the 2003 Act at this time. I will, however, give serious consideration to any reasonable and workable proposal that would deal with this matter without giving rise to the practical, enforcement and evidential difficulties that I have already outlined. The introduction of tax stamps for containers in which intoxicating liquor is sold is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
     <Quest>his views on whether the scheme of Presidential pardons that he has proposed will mean that terrorists will be able to roam free and unchecked here; if, unlike a release on licence, there will be no recourse to imprisonment if such individuals re-offend.</Quest>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of the scheme which will operate in this jurisdiction in relation to the handful of what have become known as on the runs meaning, as the Deputy puts it, that terrorists will be able to roam free and unchecked here.</P>
    <P>In this context, on the runs mean people who, if they had been serving sentences for particular offences at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, would have been released under the terms of the Agreement. As I have stated previously, an eligibility body will be established to determine whether individuals are qualifying persons. A person can only be determined to be a qualifying person subject to the condition that the person is not affiliated to, nor supports, an organisation which is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. Details of the operation of the powers under Article 13.6 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann will fall to be determined on a case by case basis but, in any event, it is, of course, the case that should persons in question reoffend they will be subject to the full rigours of the criminal law in relation to any such offences, including imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will already be aware that I have made it clear publicly that there is absolutely no question of this scheme benefitting persons wanted in connection with the killing of Garda <Col N="1703"/>Jerry McCabe or the wounding of Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan.</P>

    <P>I am further informed that in the period 1 January to 18 November 2005, there are 11,110 recorded incidents of driving while intoxicated, including intoxicated while in charge of a vehicle.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>In March 2005 the Government approved the establishment, on a non-statutory basis, of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, as an executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is intended to provide a one-stop-shop approach to services relating to the admission of migrants. This decision provides a platform for the establishment of the service. A director general has recently been appointed to the new service and work is underway on the new arrangements and structures which should come fully into operation over the coming year.</P>
    <P>The service will incorporate the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s asylum, immigration and citizenship functions and structures. The visa section of the Department of Foreign Affairs will transfer to the service in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Responsibility for the provision of visa services at diplomatic and consular missions abroad will remain with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The service will aim to develop a cohesive system for the issuing of work permits and visas through a virtual link between the work permit system in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the INIS. The overall effectiveness of these arrangements will be reviewed within two years. The economic migration policy function will remain with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The service will include a new immigrant integration unit to promote and co-ordinate social and organisational measures across the whole spectrum of Government, for the acceptance of lawful immigrants into Irish social and cultural life. The proposed new structure will have significant benefits from the point of view of customer service and the strengthening of the effectiveness and integrity of the State&rsquo;s immigration system, specifically: a single contact point or one stop shop for applications for entry to the State &mdash; combining the current work permit and visa application processes; a clearer system involving more streamlined processes; improved sharing of information in linked systems to simplify decision making; improved service times as applications will not have to be submitted to a number of organisations; and improved control and enforcement mechanisms.</P>

	<P>All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigorous investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While the term &ldquo;gangland killings&rdquo; tends to be widely used in the media in referring to the nature of certain unlawful killings and speculation in this respect is understandable, this does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na classifies crime or particular offences. Caution is necessary in ascribing particular motives to any particular incident as, potentially, this might jeopardise the procedures which need to be followed for the proper investigation and prosecution of offences. Data provided by the Garda authorities in respect of all murders recorded in the period 1996 to 2005 to date is summarised in the following table.</P>

A total of 413 unaccompanied minors, who have now reached the <Col N="1706"/>age of 18 years, have been refused refugee status since 1 January 1999. Some 211 of these have been decided to date under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended resulting in 108 deportation orders, 72 grants of conditional leave to remain under the Irish born child scheme 2005, eight grants of temporary leave to remain on other grounds, seven voluntary returns, three grants of residency under family reunification, four grants of residency under marriage to an Irish national, six grants of residency under EU treaty rights, two subsequently became EU nationals on 1 May 2004 and one is deceased.

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Bunbeg Garda station as at 22 November 2005 was six, all ranks. I am further informed that while Bunbeg Garda station is not open on a 24-hour basis, 24-hour Garda cover is provided in the area. The policing service at Bunbeg is augmented by members attached to Annagry and Dungloe Garda stations. Additional patrols are provided by the Glenties district patrol car and the district detective unit when required.</P>
    <P>Garda management report that there are currently no plans to extend the opening hours of Bunbeg Garda station to a 24-hour basis as the extension of the opening hours of Garda stations, in general, necessitates the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative <Col N="1707"/>duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.

	<P>There is no statutory entitlement to paternity leave. However, many employers in both the public and private sectors have arrangements in place providing short periods of paid paternity leave. Paternity leave was considered in the context of a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 conducted by a working group chaired by my Department. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the <Col N="1708"/>Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002.</P>
    <P>Paternity leave was considered by the working group taking into account the following issues: reconciliation of work and family life and balanced participation of men and women in work and family life; cost to employers; and comparative situation in EU member states. While acknowledging that a statutory arrangement to provide an entitlement to time off for fathers at the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life, the working group could not reach consensus on the issue. Subsequently, no agreement was reached on paternity leave by the social partners in the context of the negotiations on the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the law as it stands, married parents living together are joint guardians and custodians of their child. If they separate, the custody is normally with the parent with whom the child primarily resides, but the other parent still remains a guardian. An unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, appointing the father as a guardian of his child, without having to go to court. Under section 11 of the 1964 Act, as amended by the Status of Children Act 1987, a father, whether married to the child&rsquo;s mother or not, may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including the right of access.</P>
    <P>In all family law proceedings relating to the upbringing of a child, the court must always regard the child&rsquo;s welfare as the first and paramount consideration. Where appropriate and practicable, the court will also take into account the child&rsquo;s wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.</P>
    <P>In addition, the law now places an emphasis in terms of recognising the rights of the child to the society of both of his or her parents. Section 11D of the 1964 Act, inserted by the 1997 Act, obliges the court in proceedings relating to the welfare of a child to consider whether the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Act also provides for an emphasis on counselling and mediation as alternatives to court proceedings concerning the custody of and access to children. It encourages couples who are in dispute to think in terms of agreeing to the custody of and access to their children, without the need for court interventions. Before instituting proceedings for guardianship, custody or access, a solicitor must discuss with the parent the possibility of engaging in counselling and mediation to assist in effecting an agreement between the parties. The court may adjourn any proceedings for the purpose of enabling attempts to be made by the parties to reach agreement, with or without the assistance of a third party, on some or all of the issues in dispute. An agreement in writing between parties relating to custody, access or <Col N="1711"/>maintenance can be made a rule of court and thus become enforceable in the same way as if it were a court order.</P>
    <P>These legislative provisions are extensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child&rsquo;s care and upbringing, including access rights, having regard to the welfare of the child which is always paramount. I am aware of the concerns of fathers regarding access rights and the issue of enforcement. Operation of the law in this whole area is being kept under review in my Department.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Parliamentary Question No. 557 of 8 November 2005. I remind the Deputy that the civilianisation programme approved by the Government in 2001 is to be implemented on a phased basis over a number of years. The programme provided for the civilianisation of certain posts in the short, medium and long-term; the <Col N="1712"/>transfer of the finance function from Garda district clerks to civilian staff; and the transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as civil servants of the State.</P>
    <P>While my reply of 8 November sets out the position in relation to progress made to date, I also want to point out that the significant increases in funding recently approved by Government for the 2006 anti-crime programme will provide for a further acceleration of the civilianisation programme for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Already my Department is in the process of redeploying surplus staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food to staff the new Garda information services centre based in Castlebar. This initiative alone will result in the equivalent of 300 full-time garda&iacute; being freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties. This initiative will go nationwide in 2006. This is also, of course, in keeping with the general policy that civilianisation allows certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and allows garda&iacute; to focus on work more suited to their training and skills, thereby increasing overall operational capacity within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 179 together.</P>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region on 17 May 2005. Operation Anvil is an ongoing operation. The primary focus of this intelligence driven operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting this criminal activity. This is achieved through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain-clothes patrols. I am further informed that this operation involves a large number of garda&iacute; who are attached to the Dublin metropolitan region and other specialist sections in crime and security branch and the national support services branch.</P>
    <P>The amount of overtime being worked by garda&iacute; attached to stations in the Dublin metropolitan region and the specialist sections is not fixed and depends upon operational requirements. Consequently, to maintain operation flexibility, there is no absolute allocation to each Garda station. The Garda authorities inform me that the total number of overtime hours worked on this operation up to the roster ending 23 October was 180,672. The total cost of the operation up to this date amounted to &euro;6,422,684 and for the reasons stated above it is not possible to give the average payment to each Garda involved in this operation.</P>
    <P>As with all Garda initiatives introduced in response to circumstances at a particular time, the Commissioner keeps the operation under constant review in the context of the purpose for which it was introduced. However, I am pleased to inform the House that the 2006 Estimates published last week are making available to the Garda Commissioner funding to continue Operation Anvil as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms, and, significantly, to extend the operation to Garda divisions outside Dublin. The Garda authorities inform me that the number of arrests that have been made under Operation Anvil in the Dublin metropolitan region are set out in the following table. </P>

    <P FLI="0">The above figures are exclusive of the first two weeks of the operation as no provision was made to collect this specific data in the statistical template provided for the first two weeks. Information in relation to the number of prosecutions is not readily available, and I will revert to the Deputy when the information is to hand.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that Operation Anvil, while proving very successful, is just one part of a multi-faceted strategy to deal with the problems which it seeks to address. I take great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s landmark decision in October 2004 to approve my proposal for the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; so as to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. One thing I have already agreed with the Garda Commissioner is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing such as Operation Anvil.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any one time in its history. The Garda budget in 2006 will be at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, representing an increase of 109% over the 1997 provision which stood at just under &euro;600 million and an increase of 13% on the amount for 2005.</P>

     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

     <Quest>his proposals for a judicial ethics; and his views on whether the present situation of judicial self-regulation is workable.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the proposed Judicial Council Bill which will provide for the establishing of a judicial council with responsibility for a number of matters, including the devising of a code of ethics for the judiciary and the investigation of alleged breaches of that code.</P>
    <P>It is not true to suggest, as does the Deputy&rsquo;s question, that there is in place at present a system of judicial self-regulation. By law, regulation of judicial behaviour lies exclusively with the Oireachtas as regards judges of the Superior Courts, by virtue of Article 35.4.1&deg; of the Constitution, and as regards judges of other courts, by <Col N="1716"/>statutory provisions modelled on the lines of that Article. The impeachment process under those provisions is suitable only for dealing with cases where the matter is so serious as to warrant considering the removal of the judge in question from office. There is nothing at present available to address breaches of ethics where that ultimate sanction would be inappropriately severe and it is that lacuna that the proposed legislation is designed to fill.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the Judicial Council Bill will provide for a scheme to deal with such breaches that will involve the management by the proposed judicial council of a process, to be set out in the Bill, for the investigation by judges, with lay, that is, non-judge, non-lawyer, participation, of complaints about judicial misbehaviour. Of course the legislation will not limit in any way the functions exclusive to the Oireachtas regarding removal from judicial office where that ultimate sanction is appropriate. Work is advancing on the development of the Bill and I am engaged in consultations with the Attorney General and other relevant stakeholders in that regard.</P>

     <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a prisoner (details supplied) in County Longford who was transferred from Castlerea Prison to Wheatfield Prison after they had instituted legal action against the State whose agents had alleged that they had been involved with republican paramilitaries; if the prisoner has been refused privileges and entitlements as a result; if the allegations still stand due to those allegations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35704/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that the person referred to by the Deputy was transferred from Castlerea Prison to Wheatfield Prison in order to allow him access to the therapeutic services available there. It is, of course, open to this person to apply for a return to Castlerea Prison. I understand, however, that no such application was ever received.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that this prisoner is involved in a number of legal actions against the State; that he has appealed an unsuccessful <i>habeas corpus </i>application to the Supreme Court and that he has a further case pending before the High Court relating to sanctions imposed by the governor of Wheatfield Prison following a breach of prison discipline.</P>
    <P>There is no question that any privileges or entitlements were refused or withdrawn from any prisoner simply because he or she availed of his or her constitutional right to take issues up in the courts. I categorically reject any suggestion that this occurred in this case. I can inform the Deputy <Col N="1717"/>that my position on subversive prisoners is that persons serving prison sentences who are considered to be members of the Real IRA are held in a maximum security environment, that is, Portlaoise Prison. The person referred to was never detained in such a setting.</P>

    <P FLI="0">Garda management states that the information sought in relation to the strength of each Garda station in the Mayo division in 1995 and 1996 is not readily available and can only be obtained by the disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought.</P>
    <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Mayo division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, following on from undertakings given by the Government in the Good Friday Agreement, a review of the services and arrangements in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland was conducted. As a result of this review, the Remembrance Commission and the scheme of acknowledgement, remembrance and assistance for victims in this jurisdiction of the conflict in Northern Ireland was established on 29 October 2003. The scheme was further amended in October 2004.</P>
    <P>Payments which are made to victims or their families in accordance with the terms of the amended scheme are in respect of a death, economic hardship grounds, medical expenses and also towards the provision of counselling expenses. In addition the commission funds support groups working with victims of the conflict and their families.</P>
    <P>To date over &euro;3 million has been allocated from the scheme and paid to victims, to bereaved families and to victim support services as a result of the conflict in Northern Ireland. This includes a donation of &euro;1.25 million to the Northern Ireland memorial fund. In addition to money paid out under this scheme, awards were made in the past to victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and their families by the criminal injuries compensation tribunal, which was established in 1974.</P><Col N="1720"/>
    <P>Taken together, the total amount paid to date in respect of those who were either killed or injured in the 1972 to 1974 Dublin and 1974 Monaghan bombings and also to the support services dealing with the victims and their families, is &euro;1,982,339.</P>

	<P>The Garda schools programme &mdash; primary &mdash; was launched in 1991. The Garda secondary schools programme was piloted in 2003 and officially launched in November 2004. The aim of the Garda schools programme is to teach children sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour in order that they may: lessen the risks they may face through crime; be safer on the roads and at home; positively contribute towards crime prevention; know what the role of the garda&iacute; is; and develop positive attitudes towards the garda&iacute; and the job they do. Both programmes focus on the safety of children in every aspect of their lives. The following table details the number of garda&iacute; trained in both courses for each year.</P>

	<P>The recent recruitment competition which was advertised by the Public Appointments Service in September and October 2005 followed new regulations which I made in September 2005 with the approval of Government to alter the rules governing entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. These changes included clarification on nationality and residence requirements and removed the requirement to hold a qualification in both Irish and English in the leaving certificate or equivalent, in favour of a requirement instead to hold a qualification in two languages, at least one of which must be Irish or English.</P>
    <P>Irish society is increasingly multi-ethnic and multi-cultural. My changes to the eligibility criteria will open up entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to persons from all of our multi-ethnic and multi-national communities. This is a hugely significant step which will help to ensure that future intakes of recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reflect the composition of Irish society, to the benefit of the force and the people it serves.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that of the new applications received for this competition 1,345 have voluntarily disclosed that they are of foreign origin, while seven applicants have indicated that they are members of the Traveller community. The number of applicants who fulfil the criteria for recruitment is not yet known. The assessment of eligibility criteria is not completed until after the written examinations which are currently underway. The first recruits to be taken from this recent competition will be included in the second quarterly intake of 275 recruits to the Garda college in 2006 scheduled for the first week of May 2006.</P>

	<P>The Finlay tribunal of inquiry, which reported in 1997, noted that between November 1991 and December 1993, blood donors in the Munster region, who had tested positive for hepatitis C, were not immediately notified of their test results. The tribunal acknowledged that these donors were eventually informed by the then Blood Transfusion Service Board of their diagnosis between late 1993 and February 1994 and offered appropriate counselling and support at that time.</P>
    <P>During 2004 the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service commissioned an independent review of donor records in the period in question, by Dr. Bernard Kubanek, a German haematology expert. Dr. Kubanek&rsquo;s report was presented to the board of the IBTS in March this year and it confirmed that there was a delay in notifying 34 donors about their hepatitis C infection in the Munster region in the period in question.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kubanek found that different criteria were used to notify donors in the Dublin and Cork centres. One of his main recommendations was that the whole process of providing safe blood components to the health system should be uniform in the IBTS and directed by one responsible person and under one quality system. He also recommended that testing of donations should be performed identically under one quality system in all locations of the IBTS. The report was also given to Positive Action and Transfusion Positive which represent persons infected by hepatitis C from blood and blood products administered within the State.</P><Col N="1724"/>
    <P>Following this there was ongoing discussion between the IBTS and the groups in relation to the report. The groups also separately met Professor Kubanek to discuss his work and the content of his report. In August this year the IBTS apologised to the groups for the pain and suffering caused to donors and their families as a consequence of not being informed about their diagnosis in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kubanek&rsquo;s report provided a comprehensive investigation into and analysis of donor notification practice in the period 1991 to 1994. There have been significant improvements in the IBTS in recent years, including the adoption of a single national quality assurance system and implementation of new technologies including a blood donation system with electronic recording at all donation clinics. In light of Professor Kubanek&rsquo;s work, I do not believe there is a need to have another investigation of this issue.</P>

	<P>There is a significant responsibility on our health services to ensure that patients, particularly cancer patients, are adequately supported clinically and, where necessary, in relation to proper transport arrangements. As I have previously indicated to the House, I consider that appropriate transport arrangements for oncology patients should be made available, where necessary, by the Health Service Executive, HSE. My Department has raised this matter with the HSE <Col N="1727"/>to ensure that appropriate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel. Transport solutions are already a feature of the current provision of oncology services. My Department has asked the HSE to advise the Deputy directly in relation to current and proposed transport arrangements for oncology patients nationally.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to providing an additional 30,000 people with medical cards and a further 200,000 people with GP visit cards. Funding of &euro;60 million has been provided in 2005 to the Health Service Executive, HSE, for these measures and this will be maintained in 2006.</P>
    <P>These initiatives will assist in overcoming barriers to accessing GP services, particularly for people on low incomes. They will also help in removing poverty traps and disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work. Taking into account both of these initiatives, 230,000 additional people, including children, will be able to access their general practitioner free of charge.</P><Col N="1729"/>
    <P>In January 2005, I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%. In June, it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the target of 30,000 additional medical cards was not going to be achieved. At this time I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
    <P>I announced on 13 October 2005 that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year. My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor the number of cards issued with the intention of putting in place the required measures to ensure that the coverage targets are achieved.</P>

    <P>Provision of home help and home care packages are an operational matter for the Health Service Executive. The level and volume of services to be provided in 2006 will be set out by the executive in its service plan for 2006. This will be framed in accordance with the resources available to the executive for 2006. The report of the long-term care working group, established earlier this year by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, may also inform this process. The report will be submitted to the Government shortly.</P>

     <Quest>if she has made changes in the charges which will be made in public nursing homes in the 2006 Estimates; and the charges which will apply in 2006.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no plans to make changes in the charges being made in public nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The charging for long-stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for inpatient services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the Health Service Executive and others.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 defines inpatient services as meaning &ldquo;institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</P>
    <P>Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 <Col N="1732"/>or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser. Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
    <P>These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. Under the regulations, only the Health Service Executive has the power to levy a charge. The executive has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo;. Under section 1(<i>b</i>) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the Health Service Executive can examine a person&rsquo;s overall financial situation in view of the person&rsquo;s reasonable expenditure on themselves or their dependants, if any. It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on charges levied.</P>
    <P>The management and delivery of health and personal social services are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. It is a matter for the executive, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general rule all vehicles imported for an indefinite period into the State must register for vehicle registration tax purposes within 24 hours of arrival. This rule applies equally to vehicles imported by EU and non-EU persons. However, section 135(<i>a</i>) of the Finance Act 1992 permits a European or other foreign registered vehicle, which is temporarily brought into the State by a person established outside the State, to be exempted from the requirement to register for vehicle registration tax purposes for a period normally not exceeding 12 months from the date upon which the vehicle concerned was brought into the State. These provisions are in line with Article 39 of the EU treaty which provides for the free movement of workers within member states.</P>

The Department sought significant additional requirements and these requirements effectively required a bigger building. It was not possible to meet the increased requirements due to the restricted nature of the site.</P><Col N="1734"/>
    <P>The Office of Public Works opened negotiations with Kildare County Council to acquire an additional piece of land. In May 2005, following protracted negotiations, agreement was received from Kildare County Council to transfer this plot of land to the Office of Public Works. A revised sketch scheme was forwarded to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in September 2005 for approval and changes were again requested by the Garda authorities. Discussions are continuing between the Office of Public Works and the Garda authorities on these changes and when an agreement is obtained the Part 9 planning process will proceed.</P>
    <P>Costs to date are estimated at &euro;50,000, primarily expended on fees related to design. It is expected that construction work on the new station, which will take 12 to 15 months to complete, will commence in 2006.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under the Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. As the supply of home alarm systems was not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to these goods or services. There is no provision in EU VAT law that would allow for the abolition of VAT on home security systems.</P>
    <P>However, under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 15) Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Monitoring and maintenance fees are not recoverable. Applicants should contact the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayments (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
    <P>A scheme of community support for older people is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding under the scheme can be provided for small scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling; for security lighting; for smoke alarms and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees <Col N="1735"/>associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P><?oasys _cl11.2- ?>
    <P>The VAT refund for the purchase of a personal security alarm by or on behalf of a disabled or elderly person combined with the scheme of community support for older people outlined above are important measures that go towards ensuring those who are most in need of security systems can avail of them.</P>

    <P>In accordance with the requirements set out in the decentralisation implementation group&rsquo;s progress report of June 2005, all organisations, including Ordnance Survey Ireland, not previously identified as early mover organisations are now in the process of preparing a deeper iteration of their original decentralisation implementation plan.

	<P>Support for job creation and investment is a matter for the industrial development agencies. Under the Industrial Development Acts, I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland but I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
    <P>In terms of attracting foreign direct investment to west Dublin, IDA Ireland has had considerable success over the years. This year I <Col N="1737"/>announced an expansion of both the Xilinx and Colgate Palmolive facilities at Citywest Business Campus which will create over 500 new jobs in the next five years. Takeda Chemical Industries major new investment in Ireland will complete construction this year at Grangecastle, Clondalkin and will employ over 60 people upon completion. Wyeth Biopharma, which employs 900 highly skilled people at its facility in Grangecastle, has been granted government assistance for major investment which will create 1,300 jobs and will be in full production later this year.</P>
    <P>Enterprise Ireland is focused on the retention in existing companies and creation of new jobs in the area. Since 2002 the agency has approved almost &euro;11 million and paid over &euro;9.5 million in support of companies in south County Dublin, which includes the Dublin Mid-West constituency. The agency also works closely with the Institute of Technology in Tallaght in encouraging the commercialisation of research. It has supported the development of a business incubation space at the college to the amount of &euro;2.54 million. This facility, when completed, will generate quality start-up enterprises. Enterprise Ireland has supported the development of community based enterprise centres in Bawnogue and Neilstown, Brookfield, Bolbrook, Killinarden and Main Road Tallaght, all of which are contributing to job creation in new microenterprises.</P>
    <P>The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is one of the State agencies responsible for the economic development in the south County Dublin, including the Mid-West constituency. Since its inception, the board has approved just over &euro;7.6 million to businesses based in this area. These grants and other financial supports have assisted in the creation and maintenance of 870 jobs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the strategies and policies being pursued by development agencies are producing real and sustainable results for the people of west Dublin in additional investments and jobs. I am confident that this will continue to be the case in the future.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity-gas allowance, telephone allowance and television licence schemes, is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.</P>
    <P><?oasys _ic20- ?>The package is also available to carers in receipt of a carer&rsquo;s allowance and to people with disabilities under the age of 66 years who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years can qualify regardless of their income or household composition. Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 years whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse. Further extensions to the household benefits package could only be considered in a budgetary context and taking account of the financial and other needs of those not covered by the existing arrangements.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

     <Quest>the reason the fuel allowance to residents (details supplied) in Dublin 9 has <Col N="1740"/>been reduced due to the fact that residents are still making a payment for heating costs; his views on reversing this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders that are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards their additional heating needs during the winter season. As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowances are not payable in cases where a person has access to their own fuel supply, or is benefiting from a subsidised heating service, such as those provided by Dublin City Council at several of its housing complexes.</P>
    <P>In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, the Department recently ceased fuel allowance entitlement which had been paid in error in several cases where recipients were in local authority accommodation with subsidised heating. The allowances were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of the winter heating season but no overpayments are being assessed against them.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowances were paid in error to these people in previous years. In some instances, fuel allowance was awarded because the applicants indicated that their heating costs were not being subsidised. The non-payment arises purely from the proper application of conditions for the scheme. It would not be equitable to retain the fuel allowance in these cases when neighbouring tenants in the same circumstances are not eligible and are managing their budgets accordingly. Nonetheless, I am conscious of the particular circumstances which apply in the cases concerned and I am reviewing the position to see if there is scope to resolve their situation.</P>

	<P>Under social welfare legislation a person who is in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension may qualify for half rate unemployment benefit or half rate disability benefit subject to satisfying the normal conditions for entitlement to payment. To be entitled to payment of unemployment benefit a person must be unemployed, be under 66 years of age, be capable of and available for work, be genuinely seeking employment, have sustained a substantial loss of employment, prove unemployment in the prescribed manner and satisfy the contribution conditions. To satisfy the contributions conditions a person must have 39 paid or credited PRSI con<Col N="1741"/>tributions in the relevant tax year or 26 paid PRSI contributions in the relevant tax year and 26 paid PRSI contributions in the tax year before the relevant tax year. Classes A, H, and P contributions are qualifying contributions. Unemployment benefit may be paid for up to 156-312-390 days of unemployment. The duration of benefit varies according to the age of the person, the class of qualifying contribution, number of total contributions paid since entry into insurance and the circumstances of the claim.</P>
    <P>A widow or widower who is claiming disability benefit and getting widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension at half the personal rate of disability benefit may receive payment for up to 15 months. Widow&rsquo;s contributory pension recipients who have less than 260 paid reckonable PRSI contributions may be paid disability benefit at half the personal rate for up to 12 months. Widow&rsquo;s contributory pension recipients who have more than 260 paid reckonable PRSI contributions may be paid disability benefit at half the personal rate for up to 15 months.</P>
    <P>Following exhausting his or her entitlement to disability benefit, a recipient may re-qualify for payment of same if they have paid 13 reckonable PRSI contributions following the date he or she exhausted his or her entitlement to disability benefit. Classes A, E, H, and P contributions are qualifying contributions.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>For unemployment assistance purposes, the assessment of means for non-householders resident in the parental home has always taken into account the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him or her by virtue of residing with a parent or step-parent. In practice, this is taken to mean the value of free board and lodging to a claimant and such value is ascribed having regard to the level of parental income.</P>
    <P>The 1986 Commission on Social Welfare examined the then operation of the benefit and privilege arrangements. The commission recommended the abolition of the concept of benefit and privilege for those aged 25 years and over. In reaching this conclusion, the commission stated:</P>
<P LI="1">The reason for this cut-off point (25 years) is that by that age young adults would normally <Col N="1742"/>have become financially independent of the parental home. The minority, however, unable to obtain employment by that age or those who become unemployed at a later age should also be entitled to financial independence and it can be argued that such persons should, therefore, be entitled to a payment in their own right, irrespective of parental means. Payment at the full basic rate is appropriate in such cases.</P>
    <P FLI="0"><?oasys _ic20- ?>In the 2003 budget, the assessment of benefit and privilege for unemployment assistance claimants aged 29 years and over was abolished. The 2004 budget abolished the assessment for those aged 27 and 28 years of age. In the 2005 budget, I further reduced the age above which the assessment of benefit and privilege does not apply to 26 years of age.

	<P>The maximum qualified adult dependant increase is payable where the adult dependant&rsquo;s gross weekly earnings do not exceed &euro;88.88. Regulations provide for the tapered, or gradual, withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance for claimants of most welfare payments where the person&rsquo;s spouse-partner is earning over &euro;88.88 and finally withdrawn at earnings of &euro;220 per week.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came into office, several changes to these tapered arrangements have been introduced with a view to ensuring the impact of increases in earnings are not negated for families where the spouse is the sole earner and is in low-paid employment. The range of income over which the qualified adult allowance is withdrawn has been progressively extended. Provision was made for the deferral of the loss of half the child dependant allowance until the earnings of the spouse-partner exceeds the upper bound of the income range. In addition, the qualified adult weekly rates have been increased annually in each budget package. From January 2005, the weekly personal and maximum qualified adult allowance rates of the lowest payment rates were increased by &euro;14.00 and &euro;9.30 respectively.</P>
    <P>As is normal, the Abridged Estimates volume recently published does not provide for any enhancements to social welfare schemes. Any further changes in income limits in respect of qualified adults would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities.</P>

     <Quest>the income which is disregarded in calculating a person&rsquo;s eligibility for rent supplement, distinguishing the treatment of maintenance payments, part-time earnings, pensions and so on; the provisions which have been made for changes in any of these in Estimates 2006.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35987/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent or mortgage interest supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources. The scheme is subject to statutory means test rules contained in the third schedule, Part IV of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, as amended, and regulations made thereunder. The details of the disregards referred to by the Deputy are outlined below.</P>
    <P>Under standard supplementary welfare allowance assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Family income supplement is disregarded in the standard means test. In addition, in cases where the applicant has part-time employment, that is, fewer than 30 hours per week, up to &euro;60 of weekly earnings is disregarded.</P>
    <P>Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment. In this regard, a number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include employment support schemes such as the back to work programme and special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other secondary benefits in total or in part for the duration of the employment scheme, subject to certain conditions. For most people, the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of &euro;317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. No income limit applies to the back to work allowance itself.</P>
    <P>While this rent supplement retention income limit has not changed since its introduction, sig<Col N="1744"/>nificant other improvements have been made to the means test subsequently. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
    <P>Under these special arrangements, rent supplement may be retained for up to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% of supplement in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of &euro;317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes.</P>
    <P>In effect, this means that people who commence employment through a back to work scheme or community employment following a period of unemployment can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the &euro;317.43 limit and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement. For example, in the first year of his or her participation in the back to work allowance scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and wages of &euro;429 while a couple with two children can have a combined income of &euro;528.25. In addition, the separate maximum payment limit of &euro;317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes.</P>
    <P>People availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the &euro;317.43 weekly limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. In that context, I introduced amending regulations in January 2005 to increase the income disregard in the standard rules of the scheme from &euro;50 to its current level of &euro;60 per week.</P>
    <P>Half of any maintenance payments a lone parent receives can be disregarded as means for the purposes of assessing a person&rsquo;s entitlement to one-parent family payment. The means test for this and certain other social assistance schemes also provides for a disregard of up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance payments in instances where applicants have rent or mortgage interest obligations on their family homes. Given that up to &euro;95.23 per week of maintenance payments has already been disregarded in the means test for the primary scheme payment purposes to allow for housing costs, maintenance income up to this weekly amount is assessable in determining the appropriate level of rent supplement payable. However, depending on the particular family <Col N="1745"/>housing cost, up to &euro;60 per week of maintenance in excess of this &euro;95.23 amount can be disregarded for rent supplement means assessment purposes to ensure that the family has the benefit of the extra maintenance income up to that level before it affects their rent supplement entitlements.</P>
    <P>In the past, in the specific situation where budget increases in rates of payment were granted to old age pensioners at amounts higher than which applied to supplementary welfare allowance, a special income disregard was introduced to ensure that the people concerned received the full benefit of their budget increase. The amount of income in excess of the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate that can be disregarded in the means test for rent supplement for people aged 65 or over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension or equivalent payment from another country is now &euro;26 per household. The 2006 Abridged Estimates made no provision for changes in rent supplement eligibility, entitlements or rates of payment. Any such change in the scheme would be a matter for consideration in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>It is a requirement for the registration and entry-into-service of new cars in the EU that they have EU whole vehicle type approval, EU-WVTA. In order to receive EU-WVTA, a car must meet the technical specifications for a range of items, including the glazing and the field of vision of drivers, which are set down in a series of separate directives. It is not open to a member state to prohibit the sale or entry-into-service of a car which has EU-WVTA. Under the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, which specify vehicle in-service standards, a vehicle must be constructed so that the driver can at all times have such a view of the road and of other traffic on the road as is necessary to enable the vehicle to be driven safely. It is a requirement under these regulations for a windscreen to be fully transparent so as not to distort the driver&rsquo;s view. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I have concerns about modifications to windscreens and side-windows which result in excessively blacked-out windows and I am considering making such modifications, subject to the NCT. To do so would require amendments to the existing NCT regulations and the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 171 together.</P>
    <P>Transport 21 is a fully costed programme. The &euro;34.4 billion is based on the aggregate costs of the constituent projects and these are in turn primarily based on costs provided by the transport agencies. The agencies have confirmed that the costs and underlying assumptions are as rigorous as possible, taking account of the various stages of development, design and implementation of the projects. A greater degree of certainty can be attached to those projects that are already at an advanced stage of development. The difficulty in making accurate assumptions on final outturn costs for later projects has been addressed by providing contingency within individual projects where appropriate. On this basis I am satisfied that the total funding of &euro;34.4 billion is sufficient for the full implementation of Transport 21.</P>
    <P>My Department will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of Transport 21 by the various transport agencies and local authorities. A monitoring group is being established and will chaired by the Department of Transport. The group will include representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and other relevant Departments and agencies. It will be responsible for the high-level monitoring of Transport 21 and reporting annually to Government on issues such as financial and physical progress.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that we also need a new approach to transport in the greater Dublin area, delivered through a single authority, with real powers to ensure joined up thinking and delivery across all the transport modes. A team, chaired by Professor Margaret O&rsquo;Mahony and reporting directly to me, has been appointed and charged with finalising a structure for the new transport authority, detailing its remit and responsibilities as well as identifying the human resources which are critical to the success of the body, taking into account best practice and best experience internationally.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 401 of 25 October 2005. That reply is set out as follows and the position remains unchanged. If it would assist the Deputy, my office would be happy to arrange for the Deputy to discuss these issues with the relevant officials from my Department.</P>
    <P>Traffic and parking regulations made in 1997 under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provide that the only vehicles that may stop or park in a disabled person&rsquo;s parking bay are those in which a disabled person&rsquo;s parking permit is displayed, provided the vehicle is being used for the convenience of the person to whom the permit was issued. The prohibition on parking in disabled person&rsquo;s parking bays applies at all times of the day and may not be restricted to particular periods. Equally there is no provision in the regulations for the imposition of a charge for permit holders using the disabled person&rsquo;s parking bays.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in the traffic and parking regulations apply in respect of the use of public roads only. Section 101 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides that local authorities may make by-laws in respect of the use of car parks they provide. The determination of the provisions in such by-laws is a matter for the elected members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in a consultation process with groups representing the interests of disabled persons which are engaged in the issue of the disabled person&rsquo;s parking permits, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the regulatory provisions made under the Road Traffic Acts that relate to the operation of disabled person&rsquo;s parking permits and the use of disabled person&rsquo;s parking bays.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 440 of 8 November 2005. That reply is set out as follows and the position remains unchanged. The Road Traffic Acts provide that a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may require a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary breath specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision, where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed or where a garda forms the opinion that the person has consumed alcohol.</P><Col N="1750"/>
    <P>The purpose of preliminary roadside breath testing is to provide the garda&iacute; with a facility to assist them in determining whether a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle has consumed alcohol. However, the Road Traffic Acts provide that a person may be arrested for a drink driving offence without recourse to a preliminary breath test. In particular, there may be circumstances, especially in the context of a road collision, where it may not be possible for a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to require that a person submit to a preliminary breath test. Garda discretion regarding the use of preliminary roadside tests is an integral and important element of the enforcement provisions relating to the laws applying to drink driving and I do not propose to alter that position.</P>

A total of 413 unaccompanied minors, who have now reached the age of 18 years, have been refused refugee status since 1 January 1999. A total of 211 of these have been decided to date under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, resulting in 108 deportation orders, 72 grants of conditional leave to remain under the Irish born child scheme, 2005, eight grants of temporary leave to remain on other grounds, seven voluntary returns, three grants of residency under family reunification, four grants of residency under marriage to an Irish national and six grants of residency under EU treaty rights.

	<P>In general, there is no provision in Irish law allowing for the expunging of criminal convictions from the Garda criminal records. However, with the introduction of the Children Act 2001, provision was made for a limited &ldquo;wiping of the slate&rdquo; in respect of most offences committed by persons under 18 once certain conditions have been met. The provision in the Children Act, which came into operation on 1 May 2002, limits, as far as possible, the effects of a finding of guilt where the relevant conditions have been met by treating the person for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty or dealt with for an offence.</P>
    <P>The second programme of the Law Reform Commission for the period 2000 to 2007 proposes, as part of an examination of the law on privacy, to consider longevity of criminal records and expunging of certain offences from the records. I understand that the Law Reform Commission intends to prepare a consultation paper examining the complex range of issues surrounding the matter of spent convictions. Such consultations papers normally encompass an analysis of legislation and practice in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom. I will consider any recommendations which the Law Reform Commission may make on the matter.</P>

    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that there has been a decrease in the recorded instances of burglary and car theft from 831 in 2000 to 822 in 2004 in the Naas Garda district, which includes Kill. I am further informed that the personnel strength of Kill Garda station as at 22 November 2005 was three across all ranks. Kill Garda station is open from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily. When the station is not open the public access call box, PACB, and call diversion systems enable access to the district headquarters at Naas.</P>

Numbers of Garda personnel, together with overall policing arrangements and operational safety, are continually monitored and reviewed.

    <P>The following tables detail the number of unauthorised taking of vehicles and burglary offences recorded in the Naas Garda district from 2000 to 2004. Statistics for 1999 are not available for a full year at the level of Garda district. Figures provided for 2004 are provisional, operational and liable to change. Proceedings commenced are lower in the years 2000 and 2001 due to the phased implementation of the new computer crime recording system.

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Kerry division as at 22 November 2005 was 266 across all ranks. I have been further informed that the personnel strength of Tralee Garda station as at 22 November 2005 was 87 across all ranks. Garda management will continue to monitor and appraise the policing and administrative strategy <Col N="1758"/>employed throughout the country with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of specific concerns expressed regarding the level of Garda manpower in County Kerry. However, on Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and the needs of County Kerry will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the abolition of ground rents, a High Court challenge to the constitutionality of certain provisions of the existing ground rents legislation has been heard and judgment is awaited. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate to proceed with pro<Col N="1759"/>posals for further legislation in this area until the outcome of this case is known.</P>
    <P>As regards expired leases on dwelling houses, the position is that the ground rent tenant may be entitled to acquire the fee simple: as a yearly tenant arising by operation of law or by inference, where rent has been paid to and accepted by the landlord after the expiry of the lease and the conditions in section 15 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent)(No. 2) Act 1978 are satisfied; under section 13 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent)(No. 2) Act 1978, where the application was made within 12 months of the commencement of the Act; or under section 3(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967, as revived by section 73 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980, where the lease was a building lease or a propriety lease.</P>

	<P>A working group chaired by my Department and representing the Department of Transport, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant agencies, carried out an in-depth examination into the engagement of private sector interests in the provision and operation of speed cameras. On the basis of the group&rsquo;s report, my colleague the Minister for Transport and I presented proposals to Government in July for the outsourcing to the private sector of the provision and operation of speed cameras under the supervision and direction of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Our proposals were accepted by Government and work has commenced on their implementation.</P>
    <P>The proposals will require the introduction of changes to the current Road Traffic Acts. The Department of Transport is currently preparing legislative provisions necessary to support those recommendations and on the completion of that work those provisions will be included in an appropriate Bill for the consideration of the House. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the traffic law enforcement agency in the State, will be responsible for the outsourcing project. The Garda authorities inform me that they have commenced preparatory work with regard to the tendering process. My Department and the Department of Transport are participating in this work.</P>
    <P>Selection of an outsource provider will be made by way of an open and competitive tendering process, and a request for tender document will issue in due course. In accordance with EU and national procurement guidelines this request for tender will be published in the <i>EU Journal</i> and on the Government&rsquo;s procurement <Col N="1760"/>website. All tender proposals received will be evaluated on an individual basis in accordance with the criteria set down in the request for tender.</P>

	<P>Preliminary estimates of the cost of providing various services to the Thornton Hall site were prepared as part of the site evaluation process which was carried out by engineering consultants prior to the decision to purchase the site. The report estimated the cost of providing various services, such as mains water, foul sewer, and power including gas and electricity to the site at approximately &euro;8.5 million.</P>
    <P>On the question of road access, the existing road serving the site has been assessed as adequate by the engineers engaged to carry out the site evaluation. However, they recommended some improvements to and upgrading of the road which is currently being examined by a team of technical consultants appointed by the Prison Service. Consultation will take place with the appropriate authorities in due course.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the director general of the Prison Service that the existing access road serving Thornton Hall has been assessed as adequate by the consulting engineers who evaluated the site when it was offered to the Prison Service. The consultants, however, recommended some improvements and upgradings to the road which will be pursued following consultations with the appropriate authorities. It is too early at this stage to indicate the likely outcome of the process as the various engineering surveys on this matter are not yet complete.</P>
    <P>I have no plans at this time to acquire any additional land in the area bordering the site acquired. I do not have a statutory power for the compulsory purchase of land for the purposes referred to by the Deputy.</P>

It will also facilitate the provision of an integrated prison complex with ample recreational and therapeutic facilities. In addition, in line with a recent Government decision a site will be made available for the replacement of the Central Mental Hospital but this is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Health and Children. There are no plans to dispose of any portion of the site or to provide for facilities other than those which have already been indicated.</P>

	<P>Following the transfer of the property to the Prison Service a specialist contractor was employed to secure the residence and site against vandalism and unauthorised access. This instruction was issued by the Prison Service. The works involved included securing the windows of the residence in a non-destructive manner which preserved intact all of the features of <Col N="1762"/>the property, as well as the installation of CCTV and alarm systems, etc. No buildings were demolished or removed following the transfer of ownership of the property. Three trees were removed for safety and security reasons and did not require a tree felling licence. There are no plans in hand at present for the demolition of any buildings or any further tree felling and any such works will only be undertaken in compliance with the relevant planning and or other statutory provisions. The cost of works carried out to date amounts to approximately &euro;23,000. Some of the works involving the CCTV were procured by means of an existing public tender in place with the Prison Service. The cost of the work to the residence and other areas was negotiated with a specialist contractor by consultant quantity surveyors and certified on completion by consultant engineers retained by the Prison Service.</P>

	<P>Under the Courts Service Act <Col N="1763"/>1998, the Courts Service, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the courts, is independent in the performance of its functions. I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, &euro;96.7 million was provided in 2005. The 2006 Estimates for the service provide for an increase of &euro;3.84 million in respect of current expenditure, as well as &euro;140,000 in capital IT expenditure. Negotiations are ongoing with the Department of Finance in respect of a further capital allocation for courthouse construction, repair and maintenance. I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in this respect on budget day. The tendering and procurement process for the new criminal court complex at Infirmary Road, Dublin, is under way and construction work on the project is expected to commence next year. Furthermore, I recently announced a further public private partnership package of some &euro;50 million under which a number of courthouse projects will be undertaken. I am confident that the overall funding package provided to the service is adequate, not only to maintain existing levels of service but also to provide for improvements in services and court accommodation.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible for the Garda to quantify, at any given time, the number of properties or businesses which are in the hands of or funded by criminal gangs or in the course of acquisition by such gangs. The Garda continues to take a proactive and integrated approach to the investigation of all serious crime. The Criminal Assets Bureau continues, under its statutory remit, to target assets including property which are known to have been acquired through criminal activity. Some data available from the Criminal Assets Bureau may be indicative, however. Between its inception in October 1996 and 31 December 2004, the Criminal Assets Bureau obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of over &euro;52 million and &euro;23 million, respectively. In the same period, taxes and interest demanded exceeded &euro;81.8 million.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 215 together.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Carlow-Kildare division on 19 October last was 332, all ranks. The personnel strength of the division on 31 December 1997 was 292, all ranks. Therefore, there has been an increase of 30, or 13%, in the number of personnel allocated to the division since that date. I have been advised by Garda management that it does not intend to extend the opening hours of any of the Garda stations in County Kildare. I have been further advised that the extension of the opening hours of any of the Garda stations in the county would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties. The accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is on target. It will lead to a combined strength, of attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner is drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage the additional resources. In this context, the needs of County Kildare will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division and the other Garda divisions throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave to Question No. 143 of 19 May last, Question No. 139 of 20 October last and Question No. 497 of 25 October last. As I stated previously, I must in addition to the 11 factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, also have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, when considering whether to deport a person. The safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means that a person will not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The legislation requires that this consideration is given before the deportation decision is made. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has no direct role in law enforcement which is primarily a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, a comprehensive series of performance indicators is contained in my Department&rsquo;s 2003-2005 strategy statement. These performance indicators are linked to the high level goals, objectives and activities of the Department. I intend to publish a new strategy statement shortly. The Department&rsquo;s 2004 annual progress report in respect of this strategy statement will be published later this year and placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>I remind the Deputy of the Government&rsquo;s landmark decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. Clearly, the additional Garda resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, while it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly <Col N="1766"/>increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</P>
    <P>I have secured an increase of &euro;146 million, or 13% when compared with 2005. The Garda budget is now at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, representing an increase of 115% over the 1997 provision which stood at just under &euro;600 million.</P>
    <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat all categories of crime including public order offences, other related offences and alcohol related violence. These provisions include the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which is currently before the House will contain a range of anti-crime measures including legislative proposals to provide for anti-social behaviour orders, a proposal to provide for criminal offences in relation to participation in a criminal organisation and a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearms offences, including the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases. I am also introducing a new offence of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new legislative provisions, together with the vastly increased Garda resources which were secured in the Estimates, announced last week, will assist greatly in dealing with the scourge of gun crime and organised crime.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My concern in relation to unacceptable elements entering the private security industry was one of the reasons I brought forward the Private Security Services Act 2004 to regulate the private security industry.</P>
    <P>The Private Security Authority, which was established as an independent body in October 2004, commenced licensing contractors providing private security services in the door supervisor and security guarding sectors on 3 October this year, while licensing for suppliers and installers of intruder alarms commenced at the beginning of this month. I understand that the authority proposes to license all other sectors of the industry on a phased basis, during 2006 and 2007. Licensing for individuals employed in the private security industry will commence next April.</P>
    <P>The authority has put in place stringent criteria to protect the industry from infiltration by criminals. All licence applicants will undergo criminal records checking by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This will apply to employees, principals and directors of private security companies. Contractors supplying private security services will be required to provide valid documentation in relation to the company, including, tax clearance certificates.</P>
    <P>The PSA endorsed the National Standards Authority of Ireland IS999 as the required standard for licensing for the door supervisor, security guarding and event security sectors of the industry. Following on from this the NSAI has been contracted by the PSA to develop a suite of standards for all other sectors of the industry and work in this area is ongoing. Compliance with these standards will also be a prerequisite for the issuance of a contractors licence.</P>

    <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
    <P>Combating street violence, whether through community policing or through the wider use of Garda resources, is a core objective of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan for 2005 acknowledges, it is a specific Government policing priority for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to continue to focus on crime prevention and reduction. In the achievement of this and other priorities, it is the responsibility of each divisional officer to assign personnel within his or her division to specific duties to ensure that the optimum use is made of all available resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.</P>
    <P>In this context, I strongly support specialised and focused Garda operations, such as Operation Encounter, to counter late night disorder and I remain determined that the resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the criminal justice system in general are used effectively to combat street crime.</P>

	<P>It is not true to say there has been a dramatic increase in headline or serious crime in the past three years. For the Deputy&rsquo;s information, headline crime decreased by 3% in 2003 compared with 2002 and by 4% in 2004 compared with 2003. Furthermore, the Deputy should be aware that the crime rate per 1,000 of the population has fallen from 29 crimes per 1,000 in 1996 when the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in Government, to 24 crimes per 1,000 of the population in 2005.</P>
    <P>The most recent headline crime statistics for the third quarter of 2005 furnished by the Garda Commissioner, which I published, show a decrease of 0.2% in the number of headline offences in the 12 months ended 30 September 2005 compared with the 12 months ended 30 September 2004. In the 12 months, some significant decreases were recorded: rape of a female was down 11%; unlawful carnal knowledge was down 15%; aggravated sexual assault was down 56%; theft from the person was down 19%; and robbery from the person was down 26%. However, there have been increases in a number of the most serious categories, including murder and manslaughter, which is up 17%, rape, section 4, which is up 45%, robbery of an establishment or institution, which is up 20%, and possession of drugs for sale or supply, which is up 18%. There was also an increase of 0.4% in the first three quarters of 2005 compared with the same period in 2004 and an increase of 5.5% in the third quarter of 2005 compared with the third quarter of 2004. There were, however, notable decreases in some of the more serious categories of crime in the figures for the first three quarters: manslaughter was down 63%; rape of a female was down 14%; aggravated sexual assault was down 57%; theft from the person was down 18%; and robbery from the person was down 27%.</P>
    <P>Although the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this year has the highest level of resources ever in its history, all concerned, including this House, must continue to support its efforts in combating crime. The Government made a historic and most welcome decision in October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. Clearly, the additional garda&iacute; will be deployed in the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences. It will also be possible to address other priorities, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. One thing I have already agreed with the Commissioner is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</P><Col N="1771"/>
    <P>The Garda budget is now at an historic high of over &euro;1.29 billion, representing an increase of 109% over the 1997 provision which stood at just under &euro;600 million and an increase of 13% when compared with 2005. This increase in funding will allow for, <i>inter alia</i>, Operation Anvil, which has been extremely successful since its inception last May, to continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms and to extend it to Garda divisions outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat all categories of crime, including public order offences and other related offences and alcohol related violence. These provisions include the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003. The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, will contain a range of anti-crime measures including legislative proposals to provide for anti-social behaviour orders, a proposal to provide for criminal offences in regard to participation in a criminal organisation and a series of measures to increase sentences for the more serious range of firearms offences, including the introduction of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases. I am also introducing a new offence of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun barrel, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence. I believe the new provisions, together with the vastly increased Garda resources secured in the Estimates which I announced last week, will assist greatly in dealing with the scourge of gun crime and organised crime.</P>

     <Quest>the number of garda&iacute; available on the beat or in patrol vehicles between 12 midnight and 8 a.m. in the Dublin metropolitan division and throughout the greater Dublin area; his plans to increase this number in line with demographic changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, that the personnel strength in all ranks of each of the six operational Garda divisions in the Dublin metropolitan region as at 21 November 2005 is as set out in the following table. Of course, the greater Dublin area now extends into areas which are the responsibility of the Louth-Meath, Carlow-Kildare or Wexford-Wicklow divisions. I am advised that for security and operational reasons, it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of personnel working in any particular <Col N="1772"/>area over any specific period of time. Garda management will continue to monitor and appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed throughout the Dublin metropolitan region with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained.</P>
    <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, the accelerated recruitment campaign to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Dublin metropolitan region will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda areas throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is still as when I announced Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006, with a fully attested strength of 14,000 by 2008. As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this process, 1,125 garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. It will continue to induct 1,100 recruits for each of the next two years, by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 216 and 217 together.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that criminal networks involved in the areas of criminality referred to by the Deputy are identified in a number of ways. Ongoing investigations and intelligence gathering by specialist national units working in collaboration with other national and international law enforcement agencies, including the customs service, result in the identification of the criminal activities in question.</P>
    <P>The national units of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operate under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner in charge of national support services and include the Garda bureau of fraud investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda national drugs unit and the national bureau of criminal investigation, which includes an anti-racketeering unit. Ongoing investigations and activities by divisional and district personnel operating throughout the State also yield information and intelligence.</P>
    <P>All of the above activities identify key organisations involved not only in money laundering but also in the trafficking and distribution of drugs and racketeering. Having identified the key players, the relevant units at both national and local level undertake targeted operations designed to reduce the levels of such criminality. These operations have resulted in significant detections, such as the fact that the anti-racketeering unit, operating in conjunction with local divisional and district units, seized in excess of &euro;6 million worth of goods during the past two years.</P>
    <P>Given the largely covert nature of the criminal activities in question and the emergence of new criminal networks over time, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Garda to state, at any given time, that all sources of such activity have been identified. However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that many sources have been identified in the course of investigations. In addition to the pursuit of prosecutions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides crime prevention advice and guidance to financial and other relevant institutions.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau continues to use its powers under proceeds of crime and tax legislation to seize the proceeds of all criminal <Col N="1774"/>activity. I can inform the Deputy that Ireland has extensive legislation in place to tackle money laundering activities. The main provisions in Irish law relating to money laundering are set out in section 31 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended by section 21 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001, sections 32 and 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and section 23 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides for the designation of certain bodies and persons for anti-money laundering purposes and for the prescribing of certain activities for the purposes of anti-money laundering. In addition, it also requires designated bodies to adopt measures to prevent and detect the commission of a money laundering offence, including the establishment of appropriate internal procedures and the provision of suitable training for employees, directors and officers. A money laundering steering committee established under the chairmanship of the Department of Finance oversees this aspect of the legislation and facilitates co-ordination, across all the relevant State bodies, of policy on countering money laundering.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 amended various provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to extend anti-money laundering measures to terrorist financing. At a European level, during the past year Ireland participated in a working group to develop a third EU money laundering directive. This directive was adopted by Council on 20 September this year and its provisions are being examined to assess the legislative requirements necessary to allow for ratification by Ireland. This process will ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s already robust anti-money laundering legislation will continue to conform to the highest international standards.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to section 57 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the money laundering investigation unit of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na receives suspicious transaction reports, STRs, from designated bodies. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of STRs received continues to increase and that all STRs are examined in an attempt to link the subject or funds to any form of criminal activity. In conjunction with this, a number of suitable or appropriate STR investigations are referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As of 18 November 2005 the maximum available bed capacity of the prison system was 3,352 and there were 3,142 persons in custody on that date. That does not, however, imply the existence of 200 readily available spaces. A significant proportion of these spaces were accounted for as follows: high security spaces in Portlaoise which are not suitable for the general prison population; remand spaces located at Cloverhill Prison; newly commissioned spaces in Loughan House; and protection spaces in the midlands prison. When this is taken into account the prison system currently operates at or in excess of full capacity for sentenced prisoners with some overcrowding remaining in certain prisons.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is clear that there is a need for new prison spaces for a number of reasons including the need to eliminate overcrowding in a number of our committal prisons, in particular, Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas centre, Cork Prison and Castlerea Prison. It is also my intention to replace outdated prison accommodation with new facilities which will eliminate the practice of slopping out and also seek to eliminate the practice of doubling up in cells which is prevalent throughout the system.</P>
    <P>As part of this process, I can confirm that a total of 150 new spaces are being provided in the new Portlaoise C block which is due to be completed in 2007. I can also advise the Deputy that estimates of future space requirements are being refined by the Irish Prison Service in the context of planning for the development of the new prison complexes at north County Dublin and Spike Island.</P>

    <P FLI="0">When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and appoints an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the Garda technical bureau. The Garda authorities have assured me that every effort is made to locate all missing persons and that they consider the current procedures for dealing with missing persons to be adequate. All files remain open and under continuous review. The procedures are also kept under constant review. The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed and are satisfied that adequate resources and staff are in place to deal with this issue and are in line with best international policing practice.</P>
    <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets &mdash; print, radio and TV &mdash; in highlighting cases involving missing persons. The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in such investigations. In addition, every Garda district has a specially trained search team that is familiar with that locality.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 provides the framework for the development of our juvenile justice system. The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides an opportunity to divert juvenile offenders from criminal activity. It operates under the supervision and direction of the Garda national juvenile office, Harcourt Square, and is implemented throughout all Garda divisions by 94 specially trained garda&iacute; known as juvenile liaison officers.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Children Act places the juvenile diversion programme on a statutory basis and <Col N="1778"/>incorporates into it, as new features, restorative cautioning and conferencing. In addition, under the Act, the age limit for inclusion in the programme was increased from 17 to 18 years of age. To facilitate these innovative developments, Garda juvenile liaison officers throughout the country have received a minimum of 60 hours mediation training and some have received advanced training to provide them with the extra skills required to deal successfully with the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme is used to its greatest extent in relation to minor offences and-or for those with no or only one or two experiences of offending. One of the primary aims of the Children Act is to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. The community-based options provided for in the Act will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act generally envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Children Act 2001 is a complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</P>
    <P>In October 2004 the Government endorsed my proposals to examine the scope to rationalise and restructure the delivery of services in the youth justice area in accordance with the Children Act 2001. To this end, I established a project team within my Department to conduct this examination and to bring forward recommendations for any reform necessary.</P>
    <P>The project team consulted widely within the statutory and non-statutory sectors and published a call for submissions in the national press. The team conducted a review of existing structures and also examined international best practice in the youth justice area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who has responsibility for children, is currently examining the outcome of this review. The intention is to bring proposals arising from this examination to Government in the very near future, including proposals in the area of detention.</P>
    <P>At present, provision for young offenders aged generally up to 16 years is made in five children detention schools. These facilities, four of which are located in the Dublin area and one in Clonmel, operate under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science. The schools provide residential care, education and rehabilitation for young people who have been convicted or placed on remand by the courts.</P>
    <P>On admission, a comprehensive educational assessment is carried out on each student and an <Col N="1779"/>individual education plan is drawn up. The aim of the plan is to build upon the strengths and try to remediate the weaknesses of each individual young person. Educational programmes can range from intensive learning support in literacy and numeracy to a wide range of academic and practical subjects that can be studied up to state examination level. The children detention schools also have a drugs-alcohol misuse programme to educate young people of the dangers of taking illegal substances. In addition, to strengthen aftercare provision, step-down, pre-release units have been, or are in the course of being, established and aftercare programmes are also in place.</P>
    <P>Regarding the need for custodial and rehabilitative care for juvenile offenders, I wish to advise the Deputy that, under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts, either on remand or under sentence. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken further steps in this area. A pilot mentor project has commenced in the north Dublin area. The programme will serve as a model for the development of the mentor, family support, order. The probation and welfare service has also commenced a pilot parenting programme in south Dublin which is evidence based and focuses on parenting skills. The programme is a model for the parental supervision order.</P>
    <P>I can also advise the Deputy that my Department through the probation and welfare service provides funding to 70 projects from voluntary bodies nationwide. Some 40 of these projects provide a range of rehabilitative services to offending children in their local communities, such as education, offender management programmes, residential accommodation, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, intervention and awareness programmes.</P>
    <P>Garda youth diversion projects are community based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which seek to divert young people from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve prospects of employability. The projects are funded by my Department and administered by the community relations section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>The Criminal Assets Bureau takes civil proceedings focused on assets which are believed to be the proceeds of criminal conduct. These are civil investigations but will, in most cases, follow from earlier criminal investigations. The seizure of assets in criminal investigations or proceedings is carried out by the Director of Public Prosecutions under separate provisions.</P><Col N="1781"/>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau takes actions under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as amended, to seize property which is shown in the High Court to be the proceeds of crime. From its inception in 1996 to 31 December 2004, the total value of orders obtained under section 3 of the aforementioned Act is &euro;14,973,250, Stg &pound;2,830,175 and US $5,472,747.</P>
    <P>The bureau continues to pursue its statutory objectives and carry out its statutory functions and will continue to target the proceeds of criminal conduct and to seize the proceeds of such conduct. The amendments in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment Act) 2005 have enhanced the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in this regard.</P>

	<P>The school in question receives a service from NEPS. However, the assigned psychologist is currently on maternity leave. Schools that do not have direct access to a NEPS psychologist for whatever reason, including employee leave, are eligible to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, whereby the schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
    <P>NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the proposed new post-primary school for Gorey will be delivered by way of a public-private partnership. As I indicated in my statement of 29 September 2005 on this matter, it is my intention that the first bundle of schools under my Department&rsquo;s PPP programme will be offered to the market in the first half of 2006 and regularly thereafter in the period 2006 to 2009 to ensure a steady deal flow.</P>
    <P>The precise make-up of the bundles in terms of the number of schools in each, the geographical spread and the timing for delivery will be determined by my Department in consultation with the centre of expertise that is being established within the NDFA.</P>
    <P>With regard to the preliminaries for the new school in Gorey, my Department is in discussion with the local authority with regard to the identification of a suitable site for the school. At the appropriate time, it will engage with the authorities of the school to which he refers with regard to the process and arrangements that will be required to ensure a smooth transition from a one-school centre to a two-school centre. Part of this process will involve defining the enrolment policies and catchments areas that will underpin effective provision once Gorey becomes a two-school centre and the enrolment policy that should operate at the school in question during the transition period.</P>

	<P>The Garda, in conjunction with the former Eastern Health Board, my Department and the management of the industrial school referred to by the Deputy were engaged in a look-back investigation into allegations of abuse at this school. This look-back investigation, which was initiated in 1996 and involved interviews with a sample of former residents, identified 41 allegations of abuse. However it is not clear how many of these allegations refer specifically to 1991 or 1992.</P>
    <P>Arising from this investigation, files were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions regarding allegations of abuse at the industrial school. My Department provided every possible assistance to the Garda and made available all relevant records in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would also like to confirm that relevant documentation held by my Department in relation to the sexual, physical and emotional abuse or neglect of children in industrial and reformatory schools was forwarded to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in compliance with a discovery order from the Commission in June 2003.</P>

	<P>The Youthreach programme is the national response to the needs of unqualified early school leavers in the 15-20 age group. It is designed to offer courses of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience.</P>
    <P>My Department already has criteria governing the recognition and funding of Youthreach centres. In this regard, an integrated district approach is implemented by the relevant VEC. It involves consultation with F&Aacute;S, area based part<Col N="1788"/>nerships and other statutory-voluntary training providers in the vicinity on local needs. The district approach ensures, as far as possible, complementarity with the activities of other agencies and avoids duplication of the core functions of Youthreach in order to get value for money.</P>
    <P>My Department is committed to continue to allocate the necessary tuition hours to city of Dublin VEC for Bonnybrook Youthreach as the city of Dublin VEC has statutory responsibility for the day-to-day operations of this Youthreach programme.</P>

	<P>The proposed extension project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning and is one of the 124 schools that I announced in April of this year to progress through architectural planning.</P>
    <P>The brief for the planned extension currently consists of a total area of 1,450 m<?oasys _of7- ?>2 and was initially set to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 750 pupils. However, in light of the significant increase in enrolments at the school since the initial brief for the extension was determined and in order to ensure that the extension will deliver accommodation appropriate to the school&rsquo;s future needs, my Department&rsquo;s school planning section is in the process of re-assessing the long-term projected enrolment.</P>
    <P>When this up to date determination of the school&rsquo;s long-term enrolments has been completed, the stage 1 submission, site suitability and site survey with various design solutions, will be reviewed. My Department will then contact the school authorities in regard to the next steps required to progress this project. A decision on this project&rsquo;s progression to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-2009.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, clause 7.6 of the higher education grants scheme, maintenance grants are not payable to candidates who already hold an undergraduate degree and are pursuing a second <Col N="1789"/>undergraduate degree. Similarly, tuition fees are not payable in respect of a second period of college attendance at the same level.</P>
    <P>I understand that the student referred to by the Deputy already holds a medical degree. He is, therefore, ineligible for a higher education grant and is also unable to benefit under the free fees initiative in respect of any further studies at undergraduate level. As the rules governing the schemes are of general application, exceptions cannot be made in individual instances. Tax relief is, however, available in respect of undergraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time students and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions in regard to this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

	<P>The person to whom the Deputy refers applied to the Department to retire at the end of the 2004-05 school year under strand 3 of the early retirement scheme for teachers. The scheme specifies that strand 3 may be availed of by teachers in posts which are surplus to requirements, from which they may not be redeployed readily and which will not be filled should they leave the posts. The scheme requires that applications are supported by the relevant school authority and that the post held will not be replaced either in whole or in part. The application of the person concerned was not successful as the post in question was not surplus to requirements and would be required to be filled should the retirement be granted.</P>

     <asker>Mr. Howlin</asker>
     <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
     <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
     <Quest>the annual outlay on rental of prefabricated school buildings in County Wexford; if this is considered to be a cost-effective method of providing school accommodation by comparison with permanent school buildings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
     <QRef>[35873/05]</QRef>
   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The information sought is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy as the financial records which are maintained in respect of payments made to school authorities for rented temporary accommodation are recorded on a monthly basis and are not recorded on a county basis. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on the annual cost of rented school accommodation on specific schools in County Wexford, officials will provide the required information.</P>
    <P>In the five years since 2000 the Department has spent &euro;39.2 million on the rental of temporary school accommodation, mainly in primary schools. In addition, the Department spent &euro;73.5 million over the same period on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in the primary and post-primary sectors. This expenditure was for the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings including associated site works, and other costs such as for compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, connections for water, electricity and sewage and represents less than 5% of the total expenditure on school buildings over the five year period from 2000 to the end of 2004.</P>
    <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers, particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
    <P>The current focus within the Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. To reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded to 44 primary schools in 2004 and over 70 schools were invited to participate in this initiative in 2005. As a result of this initiative the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in 2004 was just half of what had been spent in 2003.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
    <P>The Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for pupils with special educational needs including pupils with visual impairment. The supports in question include learning support and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>Enormous progress has been made over the past number of years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs including pupils with visual impairment.</P>
    <P>At second level, approximately 1,621 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,044 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants in our second level schools.</P>
    <P>The National Braille Production Centre, which is fully funded by the Department, produces educational materials in Braille, large print format and text only for children who are blind or visually impaired. It is an essential service to these children and without it many such children would not be able to access mainstream education or be able to undertake the junior and senior cycle examinations.</P>
    <P>There are 11 visiting teachers with responsibility for blind and visually impaired students supporting the needs of children-students in the primary and post-primary sectors. All 11 teachers can teach Braille but in the event that the demand for this service cannot be met by the visiting teachers themselves, arrangements are made by them for the provision of this service by an alternative competent person.</P>
    <P>From pre-school through to third level, visiting teachers provide guidance, support and information to parents, pupils and school staff that is specifically geared to the nature of the sensory <Col N="1792"/>difficulties experienced by a pupil. Visiting teachers also provide tuition directly to pupils.</P>

	<P>The Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.</P>
    <P>There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in relation to increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>At second level, approximately 1,621 whole-time equivalent additional teachers are in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in 1998 for such pupils. In addition, there are 532 whole-time equivalent learning support teachers and approximately 1,044 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants in our second level schools.</P>
    <P>The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education has taken over key functions from the Department in special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1 October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities-special needs.</P>
    <P>The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities-special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE <Col N="1793"/>include deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s teacher education section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the special education support service to support schools staff locally.</P>
    <P>The Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>A key element of DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools for the purposes of qualifying for resources, both human and financial, according to the degree of disadvantaged experienced. This standardised system will replace all of the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives to address disadvantage. This process is being managed by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on behalf of my Department, assisted by an advisory group, and will be supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department&rsquo;s regional offices and the inspectorate.</P><Col N="1794"/>
    <P>As a result of the identification process which involved a new survey of all mainstream primary schools conducted by the ERC in May last and the updating by them of existing data sources on the levels of disadvantage in second-level schools, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the SSP on a phased basis over the implementation period. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The school to which the Deputy refers opened at the start of the 2005-06 school year and was not included in the recent ERC survey. However, my Department will be putting in place arrangements for the handling of exceptional cases that will arise in between identification processes early in 2006. The next identification process will be in 2009-10 and will continue thereafter on a three-year cyclical basis. This arrangement will include newly established schools.</P>

	<P>The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 <Col N="1795"/>to 1992, provides for means-tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full-time third level education. With regard to income thresholds prescribed under the student maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage for the relevant year. Similarly, with regard to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation as per the consumer price index.</P><Col N="1796"/>

The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant is increased, in line with the relevant social welfare payments. The current income threshold for &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; is &euro;15,626. The higher, non-adjacent special rate of maintenance is based on the maximum personal rate of unemployment assistance.

Changes in the conditions for receiving the allowance may, however, affect schemes under my Department, for example, students who qualify for the BTEA from the Department of Social and Family Affairs could also qualify for a maintenance grant from my Department.

Service in the RDF is therefore fundamentally different in nature from service in the Permanent Defence Force or PDF, in particular as regards the respective terms and conditions of service involved. Thus, the concept of pensionability which applies to service in the PDF would be inappropriate in relation to the RDF. In addition to the pay appropriate to their ranks, members who attend annual training are paid gratuities on account of losses and obligations arising from their membership of the RDF.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the question refers to the reply to Question No. 261 of 23 June 2005. As previously indicated, Government efforts and resources, together with those of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, are continuing to focus on highlighting public awareness of radon and on improving information to householders so as to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically. The Government has over the years, largely through the RPII, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to highlighting public awareness of radon and the health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high radon concentrations. For many years now, the RPII has been encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary. This approach is considered to be more effective than the introduction of a demand-led scheme of domestic radon remediation grants.</P>
    <P>A recent European study shows that, for those exposed to similar concentrations of radon, the risk of contracting lung cancer is 25 times greater for those who smoke and that the vast majority of the radon-induced lung cancer cases occur among smokers and ex-smokers.</P>

   </Qst>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations 1996 introduced the registration requirement applying to tenancies in the general private rented sector. Article 5(4) specified the fee applying to the application for registration and article 8 provided for the payment of an annual fee in respect of a house that continued to be rented. The registration regulations and the fee requirement were introduced in order to assist local authorities in enforcing the standards and rent books regulations applying to the private rented sector. Failure to comply with the registration regulations was an offence.</P><Col N="1802"/>
    <P>The 1996 registration regulations, which were made under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, were repealed by section 10(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and replaced with the registration system contained in Part 7 of the 2004 Act. Registration fees under the 2004 Act are payable by landlords to the Private Residential Tenancies Board. The level of registration fees is prescribed in the Act and the manner in which fees are collected is a matter for the board.</P>
    <P>A proportion of registration fee moneys is being transferred from the board to local authorities, in recognition of their registration fee income foregone, to fund enforcement of the private rented accommodation regulatory requirements. From 2006 onwards, this transfer will be related to each authority&rsquo;s enforcement performance as evidenced by their statistical returns and the need to distribute income across the statutory four-year tenancy cycle. These arrangements mean that authorities continue to be specifically resourced for their regulatory functions with regard to the private rented sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 262 and 263 together.</P>
    <P>Funding for the affordable housing and shared ownership schemes in 2006 is partly included in the Abridged Estimates Volume published last week and partly included in the public capital programme, details of which will be published on 7 December, budget day. The total 2006 provision for both schemes will reflect the outcome of a review of the loan and income limits and levels of subsidy recently conducted by my Department. Details will be announced next month. While the setting of a maximum house value under the shared ownership scheme is a matter for local authorities, terms and conditions of both schemes are kept under continuous review.</P>
    <P>In accordance with their scheme of letting priorities, local authorities have regard to the household income when assessing an application for social housing. However, the application of an income limit and the manner of its operation is a matter for individual local authorities but they must be satisfied that applicants have a long-term <Col N="1804"/>need for housing and are unable to provide it from their own resources.</P>

	<P>The interest rate on variable local authority loans is determined by the Housing Finance Agency by reference to prevailing rates in the financial market. The current variable rate is 2.95%. In addition, a mortgage protection charge of 0.598% and 1.65%, respectively, is applied to loans taken out on or after 1 July 1986 and pre-1 July 1986. Typical annual repayments today on a loan of &euro;100,000 over 30 years would be &euro;5,667. A rate increase of 0.25% would result in an annual increase in repayments of &euro;166.</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of variable rates in December 1987, certain fixed interest rate loans provided by local authorities would have carried rates in excess of these levels reflecting the cost of the long-term funds involved. Borrowers with such fixed rate loans are free to redeem, without penalty, and refinance in the private sector.</P>

	<P>Details of next year&rsquo;s capital funding for housing grants for disabled and elderly persons will be made available in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2006 which will be published early in the new year.</P>
    <P>A review of the disabled persons grant scheme is currently underway in my Department. On its completion, it will be possible to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme to ensure that the funding available is directed at those persons in greatest need of such assistance. Given the interrelated nature of the disabled persons, essential repairs and the special housing aid for the elderly grant schemes, all of these are being considered in the context of the review.</P>
