    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent local and national concern, namely, that in terms of expenditure on information technology on hospital services, Ireland&rsquo;s hospitals lag behind the rest of Europe, spending just 2% to 3% of their budgets on IT equipment, compared with over 5% in the majority of other European countries, and to call on the Government to provide additional funding to hospitals for IT and computer-based technology to enable them to function more effectively and provide better value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate a matter of major national importance, namely, that the Government save 200 women from dying from breast cancer by making the national treatment purchase fund available to provide a temporary breast screening service to women living in the south and west of Ireland pending the full national roll-out of BreastCheck, which it is estimated will not happen until 2007 at the earliest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to hear the details of the Government&rsquo;s stated commitment to provide a metro via Dublin Airport between Dublin city and Swords and the cost benefit analysis for linking the mainline services on the Dublin-Belfast line with an extended metro line to Donabate given the current opportunity for making a land reservation that may be lost in future as other development pressures increase in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 11, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a proposal that section 17A of the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 shall continue in force for the period ending 8 March 2006; No. 11<i>a</i>, Finance Bill 2005, allocation of time motion for select committee; No. 11<i>b</i>, Finance Bill 2005, financial resolutions; No. 11<i>c</i>, motion re presentation and circulation of Revised Estimates 2005; No. 17, Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004<i> [Seanad]</i>&mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 2, Land Bill 2004 <i>[Seanad]</i>&mdash; Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, not withstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Nos. 11, 11<i>a</i>, 11<i>b</i> and 11<i>c </i>shall be decided without debate and in the case of No. 11<i>b</i>, financial resolutions Nos. 1 to 30 shall be moved together and decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and in the case of No. 11<i>c</i> any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 11, motion re the Diseases of Animals Act 1966, and Nos. 11<i>a</i>, 11b and 11c re the Finance Bill and Revised Estimates agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does No. 11<i>c</i> include money in respect of the charge the State now faces arising from the Supreme Court judgment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On a similar matter, the presentation of the Revised Estimates is a month late. Is there a reason for this and is it connected to the additional charges incurred as a result of the Supreme Court decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns of the previous two Deputies but I also want to ask on No. 11 if it is time to revisit the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 because it is inadequate and does not follow the principle that prevention is better than cure. The situation in Askeaton must be investigated further and this legislation does not cover that need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revised Estimates do not include money that will have to be repaid by the Government to those who were wrongly charged. That will be dealt with later in the year by way of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the statement issued by the Irish Cancer Society, 25 trades unions, doctors and women&rsquo;s organisations on the unavailability of a national screening programme for cervical cancer, the T&aacute;naiste will be concerned that up to 934,000 eligible women have had to pay for opportunistic screening. Will that area be covered under any of the four health Bills that are mentioned in the Government&rsquo;s legislative <Col N="795"/>programme? It is a matter of concern and we lag far behind in a European context. It is important to women, and the T&aacute;naiste will have an interest in seeing that a national screening programme is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. If he wants to develop the debate, there is another way to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The roll-out of the cervical screening programme does not require specific legislation. As the Deputy acknowledged, there are 200,000 opportunistic screenings per year in this area. It is a matter we must examine in the context of the review of the GMS contract because this facility can be provided at local level by general practitioners &mdash; that would be more appropriate. Population screening programmes are important and early detection leads to successful treatment. They are also expensive and it is always a question of priorities. Cancer care is a priority for the Government. We need to examine how we can effectively deal with this aspect of screening in the context of new contract arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised in the House on a number of occasions the circumstances in which a constituent of mine, Dean Lyons, was wrongfully charged with the Grangegorman murders. I welcome the apology on behalf of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Is it the intention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement to the House that is more explanatory than a straightforward apology? I remind the House that the two murders remain unsolved and there is a necessity for a more detailed explanation of how it happened that Dean Lyons was wrongfully charged with the two murders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that these two murders are now unsolved. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I understand he is not around today but I am sure he would be willing to deal with the matter in the House on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children indicate whether the medical practitioners Bill will give guarantees to the women affected by the unwarranted and unjustified procedures carried out at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the content of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that Bill guarantee that those procedures, those unjustified crimes, will not be perpetrated again? I want to know whether the T&aacute;naiste has confidence in the legislation and when it will be published.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="796"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste on the legislation. The question was already answered on Tuesday and again on Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We will have that legislation towards the middle of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In the middle of May 2000, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, set up the Dunne inquiry into organ retention. Since then, &euro;20 million has been spent on this inquiry, which is non-statutory. There is information in the media that it is to be ended and some kind of inspectorate put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2000, the then Minister, Deputy Martin, indicated that should the Dunne inquiry not succeed, there would be full statutory inquiry. Will that commitment be honoured? What exactly is the situation? It is very unclear at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to assemble all the facts and that can be done without having a statutory inquiry. I had hoped to have a report from the Dunne inquiry before the end of December, but that was not forthcoming. The Government made a decision, which was reiterated recently, that the inquiry would be brought to an end at the end of March. If at that point we do not have a report, it will be a matter for me and the Government to appoint an individual or individuals who can draw up a report on what happened regarding organ retention. I believe that can be done without the expense of a statutory inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While there is ongoing consultation following receipt of the report on the roll-out of cervical cancer screening, is there a prospect that the Health (Amendment) Bill will contain a provision that will ensure cervical cancer screening is available on an interim basis for women holders of doctor-only medical cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot discuss the content of legislation. The Deputy should submit a question to the appropriate line Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government any plans to make seat belts mandatory on school buses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of any legislation but I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very urgent from the point of view of children travelling on school buses.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="797"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The gross exploitation of migrant workers is now clear to all. Can the T&aacute;naiste be more precise this morning than the Taoiseach was yesterday regarding the timing of the employment permits Bill since current legislation is facilitating that exploitation? Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that more resources will be given to the labour inspectorate because it is completely under resourced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question does not arise on the Order of Business. The T&aacute;naiste may answer on promised legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation will be forthcoming shortly. It will be introduced in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste mentioned a Supplementary Estimate in respect of the accident and emergency crisis in hospitals. Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that elderly people who were directed to private nursing homes or their relatives will benefit from the Supplementary Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. That issue was dealt with on Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there promised legislation given that the T&aacute;naiste stated it arises under promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Only the legislation and when it will come before the House arises. The content of the legislation does not arise on the Order of Business and never has been allowed on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding moneys owed to pensioners in nursing homes, will compound interest rates of 6% or 7% per annum be applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise. I suggest the Deputy submit a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it might arise under the Health (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I see that following some ground-breaking research, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, has come to the conclusion that driving while talking on a mobile phone could be dangerous and has promised legislation in this regard. When will we see this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Minister of State&rsquo;s case it is talking that is dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>His talk is not cheap.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="798"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe legislation is promised on either talking and driving or driving and talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the T&aacute;naiste that I have had replies to parliamentary questions promising legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has promised legislation. When will we see the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a long list here. I do not see it. I am sure that if the Minister of State has promised legislation, he will endeavour to produce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is he writing parliamentary replies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, we have established that the legislation has been promised. All we are asking, and it is quite in order, is when we will see the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not on the Government&rsquo;s list. It has not come to the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State does not read lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will discuss it with the Minister of State and inform the House next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should be congratulated on his initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Residential Institutions Redress Bill 2002, the list of institutions where abuse took place was not comprehensive. Amendments were made to it two years later. However, quite a number of people were in other institutions that have not yet been included in the list. These people are not getting any younger. Is it intended to amend the legislation to include the other institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has legislation been promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government passed legislation in this area. Further legislation is promised this session but I am not sure whether it deals with that issue. The legislation to include more institutions has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>An amendment is needed to include the extra institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will discuss that with the Minister for Education and Science. A Bill is promised this session on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>On 16 July 2001, the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Bill was passed <Col N="799"/>into law. We still await an establishment day. Will the T&aacute;naiste inform the House whether the Government intends having an establishment day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure we do, otherwise we would not have passed the legislation. I will have to come back to the Deputy. I will ask the line Minister to communicate with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the opening of the electricity market, will the electricity Bill have to wait until the full review which the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has inaugurated takes place? When will it be published? In her former role, and as a follow up to my colleague Deputy Michael Higgins, is it true that last year she pulled most of the labour inspectorate out of their job of inspecting work places for EU duties with the result that no inspections were taking place and the kind of abuses which Deputy Howlin will raise later today were allowed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Title>Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to the Bill is the Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Life Assurance Policies Act 2003. The legislation introduced a scheme for the disbursement of funds that were unlikely to be reclaimed and covered three categories of funding: for those who were socially and economically disadvantaged, those who were educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. Responsibility for overseeing the disbursement of the moneys for those purposes was with the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board established under the legislation.</P><Col N="805"/>
      <P>In December 2003, the Government reviewed the arrangements in regard to dormant accounts and decided to make significant changes. We now have the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 which commenced in the Oireachtas in June 2004. It proposes to amend the existing dormant accounts legislation principally in regard to decisions on disbursements from the dormant accounts fund and the role of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board.</P>
      <P>The objectives underpinning the disbursements from the dormant accounts fund remain the same as previously, that is, to assist those who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged and those persons who have a disability. The Bill proposes that the existing board be abolished and reconstituted. The board will have responsibilities similar to those in the past. It will have responsibility for the preparation of a disbursement plan and will periodically review and assess the effectiveness of the plan and the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. It will prepare reports on the additionality of the spend and comprise 11 members, with knowledge or experience relevant to the board&rsquo;s functions, and be appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the changes being introduced to the scheme will provide for the disbursement of these funds in what he called a more focused and effective way for the purposes of tackling disadantage. That sounds fine but the fact is the changes are being made to the legislation at an early stage. Given that the Bill seeks to amend an Act which was passed as recently as 2001 it is clear the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board and the manner in which the funds were discharged was too independent for the Minister and the Government. This Bill is putting in place a politically motivated fund which is part and parcel of an attempt to buy the next general election in 2007. It is a politically motivated amendment Bill and is one with which I and most of the Opposition disagree and will oppose.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the voluntary and community sector and the use of legislation and funding such as this on a once-off basis to fund the sector. This is unacceptable. What is needed is general funding on a multi-annual basis to ensure community, voluntary and disability services are provided on an ongoing permanent basis at a high level. I draw attention to the lack of that type of funding. I am director of an organisation called Cuan Saor, based in Clonmel, which covers the constituency of Tipperary South. It is a women&rsquo;s refuge and support service for women affected by domestic violence. That organisation wrote to me recently as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">Cuan Saor would like to draw attention to the fact that there has been no increase in funding to the Violence Against Women services sector since 2002. The VAW services right across the country cannot continue to provide <Col N="806"/>much needed support/information and Refuge accommodation to women and children who are experiencing domestic violence, unless the effective decrease in funding is addressed immediately. The groups involved represent two national helplines, 15 rape crisis centres and 38 refuges and domestic violence support services which between them support many thousands of victims annually. Domestic violence services continue to provide a vital service to women in desperate situations, however limited resources affects the capacity to meet the need. It is totally impossible for the inadequate funding of 2002 to sustain services with the increased running costs of 2005.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">This effective cutback in funding comes at a time when more and more women are accessing services. In 2004 Cuan Saor provided emergency accommodation for 90 women and 131 children. Cuan Saor took 1,067 helpline calls from women seeking support and information and provided 727 drop-in support and information sessions.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">Staff in Cuan Saor work alone from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. carrying responsibility for all of the services provided by the organisation, back up for this service is provided by senior staff on a voluntary basis. Lack of funding is crippling to the development of our services ie outreach services. We feel there is a growing need to expand our services to outlying towns and villages to make our services more accessible to families in our rural communities.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I wish to highlight this issue in respect of this legislation. These services are funded on an <i>ad hoc</i> rather than on a regular general or multi-annual basis, which is essential if the vital services being provided by organisations such as Cuan Saor women&rsquo;s refuge are to be provided on a proper professional and ongoing basis. The use of money coming from the dormant account fund is not the way to deal with ongoing funding of areas such as this.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The funding made available through the last disbursement of funds from the disbursement board was welcome and it benefited many areas throughout the country, including parts of my constituency. It funded local authority play areas in RAPID areas such as Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town and this is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Minister will in future be enabled to change the disbursement plan drafted by the board, that he will be in consultation with other Ministers and will make recommendations for the disbursement of these moneys, means that these funds will be used in the next two to two and a half years to buy votes. This has been the case in the disbursement of sports capital grants and national lottery funding which tend to go mainly to the constituencies of Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>I demand a totally independent method which will ensure that organisations, particularly those <Col N="807"/>dealing with the disadvantaged and those with disabilities, be given a fair crack of the whip and that the allocation of funding to those sectors would not be dependent on which Minister, Minister of State, Government Deputy or Department raised the issue. This funding should be independently allocated. The Bill is a step backwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the debate on this important issue which is also crucial for the future. This legislation has potential for more investment to benefit the weaker sections of society.</P>
      <P>The Bill forms part of the debate on disadvantage even though many people in this House and outside it seem to think this debate is over. I remind all Members that poverty still exists in our society and people are still being left behind. In parts of the north side of Dublin, unemployment is at 16% in some housing estates. This is unacceptable when the national rate is down at less than 2% or 3%. The reality must be faced that society still has a significant problem and this should be acknowledged when dealing with this Bill.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Northside Centre for the Unemployed in Coolock which is doing an excellent job of providing support and social services for the weaker sections of society. It is important to acknowledge the work of the centre. A substantial minority in society believes it is being left behind economically, socially and politically.</P>
      <P>This legislation allows the House the opportunity to put forward more progressive ideas, new policies and allow the Minister use some of the resources to serve and support the most needy. It is an opportunity to share the extra wealth being created.</P>
      <P>The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 were enacted to address the issue of dormant accounts in financial institutions. The main purpose of the legislation is to reunite account holders with their dormant funds held in such institutions, which is a fair provision. The legislation also introduced a scheme for the disbursal of funds that are unlikely to be reclaimed, for the purposes of assisting three broad categories of persons: those who are socially or economically disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. Responsibility for overseeing the disbursement of moneys for the above purpose rests with the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board which was established under the legislation.</P>
      <P>This legislation will provide a glorious opportunity. It can no longer be accepted that children are still going to school hungry and are not receiving proper nutrition. Early intervention is the means of tackling educational disadvantage. This point has been made in the House by many Members to the Minister for Education and Science and I hope she will take heed. I acknowledge some resources have been targeted at the <Col N="808"/>most needy in society and these progressive steps are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill refers to those with disabilities. I welcome much of the progressive investments and policies announced in the Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. However, there are still 3,000 people with an intellectual disability on residential, respite and day care waiting lists. The money invested in these services must be spent wisely.</P>
      <P>Many people have concerns about the manner in which the money is distributed into the system because the people on the ground do not receive the service. This is a constant complaint which I hear from parents and from those who work with people with intellectual disabilities. An organisation may be allocated &euro;5 million but the same organisation may have 300 people on a waiting list. It is a question of the management of services.</P>
      <P>Another factor to be considered is that people with disabilities and their supporters and advocates must be included as part of the management structures. Any radical reform in the Health Service Executive and other service providers must ensure that the voices of disabled people are heard on these boards. The people leading the disability movement are quality people and this must be unique when compared with other countries. People who have a disability in many cases have significant talent and constructive ideas to offer society. I would like to see them directly involved in the management of the services. I do not wish a situation where money is wasted and mishandled in the services. The extra moneys could be used and targeted for worthwhile projects.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the legislation before the House, which is concerned with streamlining an important process, namely, the disbursement of the dormant accounts fund. To understand the importance and relevance of the Bill, one must consider the areas <Col N="809"/>to which these funds are being allocated and the impact they are having.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the dormant accounts fund, as set out in current law, is to assist persons who are socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. All Deputies welcome the use of unclaimed moneys for the betterment of the less well-off. While we all talk about major economic progress, regardless of how much progress is made, there will always be people who seem to fall between the cracks. This money is ideal for use in this regard, a position that will remain unchanged in the new Act.</P>
      <P>To date the dormant accounts fund has had a significant impact in many communities, including mine, and it is right that such work on behalf of the public good be continued. Nevertheless, it is always possible to do more, not only by increasing the amount spent on programmes and projects, which the Government has already done. Rather, for numerous reasons connected with governance and public policy, organisational changes are required to ensure the money in the dormant accounts achieve maximum benefit and impact on communities.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the emerging scale of the fund, which currently stands at &euro;250 million. We are all agreed that the scale of such moneys, held in public trust, requires commensurate arrangements to support and oversee disbursements. However, when the original legislation was introduced it was not envisaged that the fund would be so large. Current legislation in this area is fundamentally deficient in terms of governance structures and organisational arrangements. For example, it makes no legal provision for a proper organisational structure for the board and, instead, provides only for an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement for the secondment of staff from Departments. Given the emerging scale of the fund, such an arrangement is not tenable in the longer term.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, current arrangements require a part-time chairperson of the board to assume responsibility for disbursement decisions with a potential spend in excess of &euro;250 million and to be held accountable to the public by the Committee of Public Accounts for all the board&rsquo;s decisions. That is wholly inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Questions also arise from a public policy point of view. We are all serious about tackling severe disadvantage so it follows that the State must use all resources available to it for this purpose in a focused and sustained manner. It is doubtful whether current arrangements for these funds can secure the optimal effect in this regard.</P>
      <P>Members of the Opposition may argue that the reasons I have outlined would suggest that a new organisation should be established with a permanent administrative support structure. I am not convinced of the merit of such a move as it would ignore the finite nature of the fund, squander significant funds on organisational costs and, crucially, overlook the expertise and knowledge <Col N="810"/>available in public bodies in regard to tackling disadvantage in our communities. That is, after all, our purpose.</P>
      <P>The general basis of the legislation is broadly similar to the administration of the sports grant scheme. Irrespective of who makes the final decision, the Government will ensure that grants to the determinative communities will be systematised and codified. I do not want the dormant accounts fund to be viewed simply as an extension of departmental programmes or another part of public expenditure. It offers an exciting new opportunity, especially for those involved in voluntary community groups who are tackling social exclusion.</P>
      <P>While I want the voluntary and community sector to have some sense of ownership in this matter, it is necessary to ensure the funds are equitably distributed on the basis of need and that is provided for in the legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the link and co-operation between Government and the community sector. The thrust of the proposed legislation is concern with the need for the Government to take responsibility for implementing the strategies for which it is elected. This is precisely what the Bill proposes.</P>
      <P>The job of Deputies is to make representations on behalf of constituents, follow up on cases and hearings and ensure that those whom we represent get their fair share. We have an opportunity to inquire into the work of all Departments. The proposed legislation strengthens this system, thus ensuring that we can secure more for our communities.</P>
      <P>I realise the legislation governing the dormant accounts fund and its board has only been in place for a few years. If problems arise, however, it is important to address them as soon as possible. After all, it is the responsibility of the Government to make appropriate changes and use proper procedures for so doing. The proposed system will be seen to be fair and transparent and will take on board expertise on disadvantage and disability, in Departments, the Health Service Executive, previously health boards, and other State agencies.</P>
      <P>The Bill takes timely steps to rectify imminent problems which, if not tackled now, would get worse in the future. If the scale of the fund continues to increase, we will have further reason to stabilise and structure the system of allocating funds and developing a more accountable process. The proposed legislation introduces the more accountable process we all seek.</P>
      <P>When one observes the effects of the dormant accounts fund on the various schemes and considers similar previous schemes, it is clear that areas of particular disadvantage have benefited significantly. Communities have benefited on the ground, particularly in areas designated under the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R programmes. If we spent substantial sums administering these schemes, I would have to tell constituents, for example, <Col N="811"/>parents seeking a playground so that their children do not have to play on busy roads, that the money was spent on administration. I am not prepared to do that and, therefore, it makes sense to deal with the fund by means of administrative arrangements already in place in Departments. Such a system has worked well with the national lottery allocations to those entitled to lottery funding. The arrangements proposed in the Bill demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a structured, transparent and effective system of funding for all voluntary and community groups. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and welcome it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the work he is doing in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. He is known as a straight talker who adopts a pragmatic approach to the issues of the day. He has introduced practical measures to address the issues for which he has responsibility and, as a Deputy for Dublin North-West, with my colleague, Deputy Carey, he is very familiar with the position on the ground, particularly with regard to disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will be remembered for his pragmatic approach to the new scheme under development in the Ballymun area. It will become a tribute to him and the Taoiseach, both of whom have invested a great deal of time and effort in improving substandard flat developments throughout Dublin city and beyond. When the history of the period since 1997 is written, the commitment made by Government to replace substandard flat schemes, particularly in the inner city, with much higher quality housing will feature prominently. This has been done quietly by the local authorities with Government support. All of us will benefit when the various projects are brought to conclusion.</P>
      <P>I served with the Minster of State on Dublin City Council when he was chairman of its housing committee. His pragmatism, evident to all during that period, is again evident in the approach he has taken to drugs, housing and other issues in his current portfolio. The Residential Tenancies Act, for example, is practical legislation which has resulted in improvements in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>The Dormant Accounts Act 2001 and the Unclaimed Life Assurance Policies Act 2003 were enacted to address the issue of dormant accounts in financial institutions. The dormant accounts fund is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, while disbursements of the fund is the responsibility of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, established on 5 June 2002. The board prepares a disbursement plan, presents its objectives in making disbursements and the strategy for achieving them and sets out the priorities for each of its areas of activity. Money is spent on persons who are economically, socially and educationally <Col N="812"/>disadvantaged and those who have a disability. The board&rsquo;s plan sets out disbursements to RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas and it has been engaged in this activity since its establishment.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced a change in regard to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board last year. However, the Government is committed to maintaining an open, transparent and accountable process for dealing with applications for dormant accounts funding. That commitment is honoured in this legislation in various ways, which I will outline if time permits.</P>
      <P>Area Development Management Limited was hired by the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board to undertake the job of evaluating and processing applications against certain criteria. The board does not currently have its own structure and staff. Staff have been seconded from within the Civil Service and the chairman is part-time. This situation is unsatisfactory. Under this new legislation, however, the board will still have a major role to play in tracking Government decisions, accessing allocations and reporting on its activities. The Government can bring the expertise of the entire system to bear on this process under the new arrangements set out in this Bill, by involving all State agencies in the advisory process.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the current <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement will be put on a statutory basis. It is proper that the Government should allocate funds. We live in a democracy and the elected Government is accountable to the Oireachtas. I make no apologies for the changes announced in this Bill, which will bring a greater efficiency and comprehensive thinking to the process of allocating funds having regard to the policies of the various Departments. Under these new arrangements, the costs of distribution will be kept to a minimum. Government schemes administered by the various Departments will benefit in this regard. The Government is ultimately responsible for implementing strategies and it is welcome that this fund will feed into the overall system in a joined-up manner.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, the structures in place to deal with disadvantage include a RAPID programme in regard to the Bunratty Road Maisonettes, the Dublin north east drugs task force and the Northside Partnership. These three groups do tremendous work in tackling disadvantage in this area. As a member of the board of the Northside Partnership, I have experienced at first hand the work done in co-ordinating policies to tackle disadvantage in parts of Dublin North-Central.</P>
      <P>Another body contributing to this work is the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund, which has successfully brought forward many proposals that would not otherwise have come to fruition. The services provided by the community development programme are of absolute necessity in areas of disadvantage and I welcome the <Col N="813"/>expansion of that programme over the years. Behind all this is the national anti-poverty strategy into which the policies of the various Departments fit and which is working well.</P>
      <P>Some say the Celtic tiger has not benefited all areas. However, the effectiveness of the RAPID programme in the Coolock area, for example, disproves this contention. A site in this area was completely derelict some years ago and two schools located on that site were forced to close because of a shortage of pupils. The condition of that site today is indicative of the moneys that have been spent under the various programmes over several years.</P>
      <P>The Northside Civic Centre was established through a grant of approximately £6 million from the OPW. Another development is the Coolock Development Centre, in which enterprise units were established through substantial funding from Enterprise Ireland and money was provided to expand the buildings of St. Michael&rsquo;s House. President Mary McAleese yesterday officially opened the offices of the Northside Community Law Centre, formerly the Coolock Community Law Centre, in the Northside Civic Centre. Several State agencies are also accommodated in that centre, including Dublin City Council, F&Aacute;S, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and a social welfare office. The local community radio station is also housed there.</P>
      <P>That once derelict site with two empty schools is now thriving with economic and community activity. This happened over the short period since 1997 and proves that the structures to tackle disadvantage are working. I am sure there are other parts of the city and country where more needs to be done but I acknowledge and welcome what has been achieved in this particular RAPID area.</P>
      <P>The structures in place to tackle disadvantage must always be open to review. In this regard, I welcome the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, published in August 2004, that the boundaries of these structures will be kept under constant review. I will have suggestions in this regard in due course. There is a case for examining the structures to discover whether there is some duplication or overlap of activities and whether amalgamation or further co-ordination is required.</P>
      <P>An extensive section of the programme for Government relates to the building of an inclusive society and deals with such issues as health, education, crime, older people, pensions, children and child care, disability and caring, supporting diversity and tolerance, asylum and immigration, equality and law reform, tackling drug abuse and regenerating disadvantaged communities. While the much abused phrase, &ldquo;A lot done, more to do&rdquo; is somewhat appropriate, progress has been made in the regeneration of disadvantaged communities. I call for full implementation of the various measures announced in the agreed programme for Government. This Bill is necessary as <Col N="814"/>the time has come to review disbursements from the dormant accounts fund. It will bring about increased co-ordination in Government policies aimed at tackling the plight of the disadvantaged in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>No Member disagrees with a review of the disbursements mechanism. As projects come on stream and additional moneys are made available, common sense dictates that matters be reviewed. People&rsquo;s needs change, if not on a weekly basis, on a yearly one, so that one will always have to deal with different sets of circumstances. However, Deputy Haughey&rsquo;s claim that this legislation is necessary is not true. It may be necessary from the viewpoint of a Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher or Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced because the Government was clearly surprised at the amount of moneys available from the dormant accounts fund. Initially it was believed the fund would only amount to a once-off &euro;100 million. Now it appears it will reach an excess of &euro;225 million, not including the life assurance policies upon which the Government is now about to lay its hands. In the same context as the taxpayer contributes to the public purse, these moneys do not belong to the Government. These moneys were scraped together by people on average incomes, put into accounts to ensure a decent burial for themselves and in the hope that in the event of a posthumous debt, it could be claimed by their dependants. In some instances, there were no dependants; in others, they did not know about the funds. No matter what efforts are made to track people down, there will always be the untraceable individuals.</P>
      <P>Taking these factors into account, where is the best place for the moneys? It is disingenuous for the Minister of State, with a troop of backbenchers behind him, to tell us that the best place is in the Government&rsquo;s coffers, as a little slush fund for it to dish out before the next election. Will the Government Members hold their hands up to admit the Bill is simply a mechanism for them to get their hands on money to win the next election? It is a return to the old style politics of cap in hand. Instead of applications being made and then assessed by an independent board, groups will now have to go to their local Government Deputies to ask them to put in a good word with the relevant Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that the projects are deserving. In 2001 the then Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy who subsequently went to a better job, introduced the first Dormant Accounts Act. He stated on Second Stage:</P>
      <P LI="1">To get away from the problem of having the Government blamed of having a slush fund, it has been decided to establish a board of trustees. The board will distribute the money, subject to guidelines and without direction from the Government. . . .</P><Col N="815"/>
      <P LI="1" el="0">[I think this is] the best approach . . . to give the power to distribute it to a disbursals board and not the Minister.</P>
      <P FLI="0">However, in this amending legislation, the power will be given to Ministers. The then Minister for Finance recognised the inherent dangers in allowing the Government to distribute these moneys. At that time, the fund was put at &euro;100 million. Now, the fund has risen to &euro;225 million, set to rise again due to annual interest on the fund of &euro;4 million. One must consider this in the context that the disbursements board has only distributed &euro;5.6 million, despite the torrent of applications, and the original legislation has not changed in respect of the groups being funded.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election the then Minister of State with special responsibility for local development, Deputy Eoin Ryan, now gone to warmer climes, introduced a new programme known as RAPID. Clearly marketed, its very name captured its intention to front load plans for disadvantaged communities above all other local authority plans. Areas that had suffered large degrees of disadvantage were to receive investment for plans the residents believed were necessary. I was part of a group, that sat for nights on end, that involved every local group such as the nuns, the shopkeepers, the people who cleaned the church and the priests. They genuinely became involved in the projects. Their application did not, as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v often claims about these projects, include everything and the kitchen sink. They had realisable goals for necessary improvements to their community. Some were small, such as pedestrian crossings; others large, such as community centres. However, as soon as the general election was over, the RAPID programme stopped. If it were not for the continuous hard work of a small group of people who push to have little improvements made to their communities, none would occur. However, the large funds from the RAPID programme did not come through.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, every Member received the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s plans for roads, bypasses and ancillary works. I noted funding designated for Blackpool in Cork city that should have been put in place four years ago by the National Roads Authority. It was to include ancillary works when the bypass was completed. However, this year it will be completed under the RAPID programme. It is not RAPID funding. The Minister of State and I know it is not. However, that is how it will be advertised. If a bollard is erected to stop cars from mounting a footpath, it is now put down to the RAPID programme, when the funding really comes from ongoing National Roads Authority projects. The RAPID programme was designed to be additional funding and not a replacement of local authority funding.</P><Col N="816"/>
      <P>When one sees what has happened to national lottery and RAPID funding, the Bill&rsquo;s intentions are clear. The original Bill&rsquo;s intention was far-seeing, particularly considering the current crises in health care, child care and services for people with disabilities. Several Members claim streamlining the administration of the dormant accounts fund through the Department will reduce costs and be more effective. The running costs of the board of the dormant accounts fund was &euro;148,000, including set up costs. Anyone who says the reason it is being moved is for reasons of cost and efficiency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No one did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government backbenchers did. Anyone who says that is telling lies. Government backbenchers have much speedier access to the type of information I have in front of me. Administration and costs are not the difficulty. The reason it is being moved is that the Government did not realise how much this fund held. In its first report, the dormant accounts fund board said it had no concept of how much the fund held. The Government saw this and simply could not resist it. It said &ldquo;Good God, what are we doing allowing these people to disburse this fund when we could do it better.&rdquo; That mindset must be overcome. In many ways, Deputy Haughey said that, but not very clearly. This money will become Government funding. Instead of being additional funding to areas of disadvantage, it will now become the Government&rsquo;s contribution to areas of disadvantage for which it was never intended.</P>
      <P>If we could hear the opinion of those whose money it is, that is, people who are long gone, they would agree it should go to child care, people with disability and to disadvantaged areas. I can only speak for Cork but child care in Cork city is in crisis. Meetings are being called and faxes are being sent because the funding for workers is being cut, yet this fund is supposed to be for child care. Child care is the last remaining barrier to women&rsquo;s full participation in society, yet funding for child care is being cut.</P>
      <P>I was at a meeting last Monday night of a job search group in the Ard Bhaile complex in Mayfield, which is not a very affluent area. It was originally funded by F&Aacute;S and was set up by partnership. The funding is gone but the group needs an additional &euro;51,000 to keep the doors open. For the past five years, the group has helped people from that area to find employment. It is making a contribution to the central purse and to society, yet it is being closed down. However, we constantly hear how great this Government is and of the progress made. It is easy to show progress starting from a zero base.</P>
      <P>The Centre for Independent Living in Blackpool operates out of a former haberdashery shop which is totally unsuitable. We all know the difficulties people with motorised wheelchairs face. The centre has no other premises yet it must operate and provide a service to people with a <Col N="817"/>disability in that north Lee area. It must meet certain people in hotels because it cannot bring them to the centre. Why has that problem not been resolved?</P>
      <P>In regard to schools, I can only tell the Minister of State about one school, although I have a list of about 20. A school close to where I live has three prefabs which it has been using for the past 20 years. One of them is simply falling apart and cannot be repaired. The school applied for funding under the dormant accounts fund but since only &euro;5.6 million was allocated last year and the board was swamped with applications, it was not even considered and was asked to apply again.</P>
      <P>To say the dormant accounts fund is being subsumed into the Department because the board has a part-time chairperson and an insufficient number of staff is the lamest excuse I have heard in a long time. Surely, if someone is to do a critical job for the Government, he or she should have a sufficient number of staff. If the board needs a full-time chairperson, it should have one. The school I mentioned is in a RAPID area and serves three schools designated as disadvantaged. It is not as if it is outside the loop or does not qualify. I am not surprised the board has been unable to allocate more money because clearly the problem is an insufficient number of staff to process applications.</P>
      <P>On 14 February last I attended a St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day ball, and I know the Minister of State will say &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it well for you&rdquo;. It was a lovely night but that ball was a fundraiser for a school dealing with children with autism. The parents who attended had a difficult job trying to attend that night. Why must these people fundraise? Do they not have enough on their plate dealing with a family and a child with difficulties? Why must that school fundraise if so much progress has been made? Everyone who visits the school, including Deputies from the Minister of State&rsquo;s party, says how wonderful it is. Why do we not encourage such people? Why did they need to make an application for a pre-school of which no one appears to be taking any notice? Why is the Asperger association in Cork looking for a second level school? The dormant accounts fund was supposed to help people with intellectual disability or people with disability so why must they still fundraise? Why is no one taking any notice of their proposal for a pre-school and second level school? One father said to me that by the time they get the second level school his child will be too old, yet we have this fund which is supposed to fund such initiatives.</P>
      <P>I am sure, like me, the Minister of State gets at least five telephone calls per week asking how people will manage an elderly parent who must go into full-time care. In Cork places for the care of the elderly are so limited that they are like gold. It has driven people to lengths to which they thought they would never go. A geriatrician, who sat on the board which produced the Hanly report, told people that they are in need of full-<Col N="818"/>time care and attention, that they must not go home from hospital and that they must go into residential care but as they walk out the door of the hospital, they are given the forms for subvention for private nursing home care. Surely, this is a disadvantaged group. In future very few of us will be able to afford to pay fully for the type of care we need if we suffer dementia, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease etc., which is why we pay taxes and yet this is what is happening.</P>
      <P>The care of the elderly is a boom industry in Ireland. The legislation before us will result in nothing more than a slush fund. It has been introduced because the Government did not realise the scale of what was available to it and now it intends to also raid live policies. I think the Minister of State is wrong and should not proceed for the sake of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMulcahyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
	<P>While not particularly welcoming the Bill, I welcome a second major piece of legislation dealing with dormant accounts funds. The only element of the previous speaker&rsquo;s speech with which I agree is that nobody anticipated the extent of funding that would become available as has happened with many recent financial issues. Nobody, not least the Department of Finance, has quite understood the extent of growth in the economy and the amount of money in financial institutions. For whatever reason I do not believe anybody fully understood the nature and sheer scale of funds that would become available from dormant accounts.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge that the dormant accounts structure is a dual structure. The primary purpose of dormant accounts legislation is to enable individuals or in the case of deceased people their estates to apply to financial institutions to reclaim their money, which has been lying dormant. To this extent nobody can deny that the original legislation has been extremely successful. The total amount of money reclaimed to date by people with dormant accounts is approximately &euro;265 million, which represents an extraordinary benefit to those who have got their money back. An old provision existed whereby people with life assurance policies or pensions bought an annuity from the life assurance company and if the person died one year into their pension, the entire benefit of the pension was wiped away. A change was made in one of the Finance Acts to remedy this anomaly. I put this legislation into the same bracket. On the first strand of its activities it has been a great success.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State agrees that the jury is still out as to whether the grant-in-aid that has been made to many worthwhile organisations through the various disbursements under the second strand, which is for want of a better phrase the charitable end, has been successful. I have never seen a comprehensive review assessing the effectiveness or otherwise of these moneys &mdash; perhaps it is still too early. I have the benefit of a very comprehensive list of the recent grant allocation of approximately &euro;41 million <Col N="819"/>made to 420 different organisations, which results in an average grant of approximately &euro;100,000. The taxpayer is entitled to know whether the State has got value for money. While I do not say this in any critical sense and I believe there is scope within the Bill for this, among the most important work the Minister of State and his Department could do would be to evaluate as quickly as possible the effect of these grants in RAPID, CL&Aacute;R areas and other disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>From reading the list my impression is that it has been a broad sweep and I am sure every county has been looked after. However, it seems to be somewhat of a scattergun approach. The moneys have been directed geographically and by social group. However, what is the broad policy thrust? Are we really trying to target youth groups, disabled groups and other forms of disadvantaged groups? Quite a disparity is apparent between the average capital amounts allocated to various counties. Carlow got an average of approximately &euro;52,000, Kildare got &euro;140,000 and Roscommon got an average of &euro;91,000. Wicklow had only eight projects and got &euro;1.286 million which gives an average of approximately &euro;160,000. Dublin got an average of &euro;101,000 for its projects and was nearest to the mean national average. No consistency is apparent in the average net grant which groups in any part of the country received. I would like to see more thought put into the matter. Should we give more grants that are smaller? Should we focus our attention on flagship projects? Should every county get just one, two or three major grants? I am not convinced that sufficient thinking has gone into the allocation rationale.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the general tenor of all the Opposition speeches regarding the approach to the Bill. They seem to suggest we should continue with the existing process whereby the money is distributed by ADM, which is a sort of semi-State organisation, and politicians should have no say in the matter. I simply do not accept this argument. Under the Constitution, as politicians we are ultimately responsible for the disbursement of all moneys. The Minister is responsible to Members of this House for the disbursement of all moneys. Most grants are distributed by Departments, including the well-known example of sports capital grants. If a club wants to build a new clubhouse, it applies to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism. Rigorous criteria are applied and points are allocated for social disadvantage, contribution by the club, private fundraising, public access etc. Committees of experts examine all the applications to determine whether they meet the criteria and ultimately the Minister decides. The Minister is then answerable to this House for that decision. I challenge the Opposition to tell me why it should be otherwise. Where is the benefit in, if one likes, letting politicians off the hook? Where is the <Col N="820"/>benefit in allowing an unelected body make all these decisions?</P>
      <P>I do not agree with everything in the Bill. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to consider some suggestions for its improvement. The Government engaged ADM Limited to process and evaluate applications for grants under the dormant accounts fund. I do not know whether ADM has contacted other politicians to ask their opinions on the 420 projects that have been approved. I have never received a letter or a telephone call from ADM, asking me for my opinion on the matter.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I was elected to Dublin City Council in 1985 and served for 17 years until I had to resign in 2002 after I was elected to this House. I have also served as a Senator and as Lord Mayor of Dublin. I know my constituency intimately. I have a good working relationship with almost every organisation in my constituency that will receive grant aid under this scheme. I was not consulted by ADM, however, and I presume that none of my fellow public representatives was either. Is it not evident that a local politician would be one of the best people to consult about the value of projects in a given constituency? Have politicians joined the class of untouchables to the extent that their opinion no longer counts?</P>
      <P>I challenge bodies like ADM Limited to talk to local public representatives so that our genuine and democratic voices can be heard. When I contacted ADM Limited on one or two occasions, I found that its officials were courteous and provided as much information as they could. I never found that they were overly flaithi&uacute;lach with such information, however. As ADM&rsquo;s evaluation process was not particularly transparent, I was not in a position to evaluate its evaluation of the projects. One of the most important challenges the Minister of State and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs faces is to review the success, or otherwise, of the grants allocated so far.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy on the Government side of the House, I wish to state clearly that of the 420 projects funded under the dormant accounts disbursement system many should have been funded by the Exchequer through the departmental Vote system. Moneys from dormant accounts should not have been used in many cases, such as for youth facilities and bus services for disabled people. Funds to support such projects are required and properly payable under various departmental headings. Therefore, such funds should be made available through a departmental Vote.</P>
      <P>I was under the impression that moneys from dormant accounts would be used to fill gaps in areas generally untouched by normal Government expenditure. That should be the case. When allocations are being decided on in the future, funds should be made available for exceptional matters, such as new and positive developments to support the weakest and poorest in society. I <Col N="821"/>suspect the Minister of State might share my view that the Exchequer should have funded many of the projects essentially funded by ADM.</P>
      <P>I understand the system will have two phases. The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board will prepare and submit to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs its plan for the disbursement of the moneys acquired from dormant accounts. Having received the plan, the Department will decide, in accordance with a transparent set of criteria, whether various projects should be grant aided. I do not see any problems with such a logical system. Independent bodies should have set out a comprehensive policy framework. It would be good for democracy to ensure that the Government and the relevant Minister are responsible for making decisions about the spending of every euro. They should be accountable to this House for such decisions.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State agrees that we are adopting a centralised approach to the distribution of these funds. After the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board has prepared a plan outlining its policy objectives and philosophy, perhaps we should give the funds to the local authorities, in the same proportion as they receive funds from the local government fund, to be distributed as they see fit. The area committees of the local authorities could be charged with dispersing the funds in accordance with the philosophy outlined by the disbursements board.</P>
      <P>We have a tendency to over-centralise matters in this country. Given that local authority officials and politicians are responsible people who are in touch with their communities, there is a strong argument for allowing them to distribute the funds accruing from dormant accounts. Such people are closer to what is happening at local level than those at departmental level. They operate under strict ethical guidelines and are accountable to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. We are too keen to adopt a centralised approach to the management of our affairs, by and large. Although Ministers meet deputations, etc., they cannot be expected to have an expert knowledge of every project in every corner of the country. Who has a better knowledge of such matters than county managers and regional officials working on the ground in local areas, or councillors who live and work in such areas?</P>
      <P>There is a bad and dangerous tendency in society and in legislation to write politicians out of the picture. We no longer seem to have the right to be consulted or to sit on State boards. It has gone too far. If we do not restore politicians to the middle of the picture and make them accountable, there will be a decline in democracy and sovereignty. In such circumstances, supremacy will be retained by the unelected Government of Ireland &mdash; civil servants who are <Col N="822"/>not accountable to the public, are rarely if ever fired and do not face election every five years.</P>
      <P>Despite my criticism of certain aspects of our handling of this matter, I welcome the Bill before the House as a fresh approach to the distribution of a fund that is much larger than we initially thought possible. I hope the Minister of State will consider my comments on the Bill as it progresses, for example on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill. As someone who is involved in at least ten voluntary organisations, I am aware of the value of the funds available from various sources for voluntary and community initiatives throughout the country, particularly in north Kerry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy queried Opposition speakers&rsquo; questioning of the integrity of Ministers&rsquo; expenditure of public money. He should note that people mostly refer to the national lottery in this regard. There are many controls over everyday Government spending but the national lottery was certainly abused in many instances over the years. I recall a famous case in which a Minister not only announced a grant to a successful club but insisted that he be played into the town in question by a band while waving the cheque. This was the wrong way to do business. It created the wrong impression of how politicians handle public money and created the perception that they abuse the disbursement system for their own electoral gain. Unfortunately, this has happened to some extent regarding the disbursement of national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>The present system is working quite well, by and large. There is a system whereby applicants can find out why their applications failed. For instance, they might not have provided the matching funding or targeted the marginalised or socially disadvantaged, or they might not have had proper plans in place or received planning permission. The present system is more transparent than the previous one although the Minister has some discretion and the Minister&rsquo;s county always seems to do better than other counties. As a fellow county man of the present Minister, I am not complaining that County Kerry is doing quite well at present.</P>
      <P>When the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, was setting up the structure pertaining to the dormant accounts fund, he emphasised that he was transferring responsibility from the hands of politicians to an independent board. His reasoning was that, irrespective of whether a politician&rsquo;s decision on funding is correct, questions are always asked when he or she has a say in how a grant is to be allocated and spent.</P>
      <P>I do not want to dwell too much on this subject because the Bill is a now a <i>fait accompli</i>, but it must be noted that the impression of community groups and the Opposition is that the Government will use the dormant accounts fund in a similar way to the way in which the national lottery fund may have been used as a type of slush <Col N="823"/>fund. Members on the Government benches would also hold this view if they were on this side of the House. I appeal to the Minister, for whom I have great admiration, to ensure he will administer the fund very fairly and that the Opposition will not be in a position to accuse him of the contrary and of being politically motivated in the disbursement of funds. To ensure transparency and obtain support from all sides of the House, perhaps the Minister will consider consulting Members on all sides of the House. Perhaps he could consult the Oireachtas committees for guidance, in respect of successful applicants, for example.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy suggested that there might be a role for local authorities. He contradicted what he said at the outset regarding ministerial responsibility for money. However, he emphasised that there is too much centralised decision-making and that the local authorities would comprise the best instrument of State to administer the fund. I agree with him in this regard. The more local the decision-making process, the more effective the targeting of the money at the marginalised and socially deprived will be. Local authorities are generally not given enough responsibility for disbursing funds locally. The cake can be divided centrally but it may be more effective if local authorities are given a greater say in its division. Perhaps they could be consulted or asked for advice on particular projects in their areas if this did not lead to a bureaucratic quagmire in which the Minister would have to await replies regarding such projects and encounter other delays. They could have a very effective role in deciding how to disburse the money.</P>
      <P>The fund, which will soon amount to &euro;230 million, arises from unclaimed life assurance policies and dormant bank accounts. I am involved in an organisation, a local committee that had a bank account in the 1980s. A member of the organisation recently went to the relevant bank and asked about the account. The bank manager advised this member that the Government took the money for the dormant accounts fund. The secretary of the committee may have left the region or died. The community in which the organisation is located was not very big at the time and it should have been possible to consult locals to track down the secretary.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many similar cases exist. How many holders of dormant accounts from which moneys were appropriated could have been traced? In some instances, families may have been involved. Was there a thorough check done in tracking the owners of dormant bank accounts across the country? Who was responsible for tracking? Was it the local bank manager or someone else? What efforts were made to ensure that there were no persons who could lay claim to the money?</P>

	<P>There is a reserve.</P>
      <P>I refer to this Bill as it now stands, bearing in mind that it has been changed, and I do not want to indulge in any criticism apart from clarifying a few matters raised by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
      <P>I have been speaking about the general disbursement of funds and the Minister of State has been very open in this regard. If I had one criticism about how the fund was distributed, it would be that it was very restrictive. It was targeted at CL&Aacute;R and RAPID areas in particular. There was a clause under which there was provision for education outside those areas. There are deprived areas in all areas of the country and there could be a very deprived estate or community in an area that is not in a RAPID or CL&Aacute;R area.</P>
      <P>When the CL&Aacute;R areas were being established, I made a very strong point to the Minister that he should not use as a guide the data on population decline since 1920 &mdash; I believe that was the deadline &mdash; but those on population decline in the past 20 or 30 years. The places most affected by population decline in the past 20 or 30 years are being hit hardest. Certain areas not attached to an existing CL&Aacute;R area were excluded because they were islands. They meet all the criteria, including population decline and low family income. I hope that under the new set of guidelines and conditions the Minister of State will have more flexibility to consider areas outside those that are targeted. They could then get their fair share of the funds.</P>
      <P>Someone made the point that the funds should go back into the communities from whence they came. Communities in Dublin would do very well by virtue of the population size. I read in a newspaper someone making the case that money from a local bank should go to the community where it originated. The Minister of State might refer to that in his reply. I can see he is shaking his head because he does not agree with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Kerry would do very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>That may be why I am saying this, but I do not know how much came from the dormant accounts in Kerry. The case was made that people who collected this money, through business or whatever, did so in the local community, so it should return there.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State published the report of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, entitled Volunteers and Volunteering in Ireland. There are many young people in the Visitors Gallery today who would appreciate the people who work with committees and youth clubs, and organise sport around the country. These people <Col N="825"/>go to schools to help the pupils do physical education, art and music, free of charge in some instances.</P>
      <P>They save the country a considerable amount of money. The sum mentioned as a saving from all those volunteers who look after young people in youth clubs, and football and basketball teams, boy scouts and so on, is &euro;485 million a year in wage bills. To replace an estimated 475,000 volunteers working for charitable organisations would cost the Exchequer a minimum of &euro;205 million and could cost up to &euro;485 million every year. That was a finding of the valid and credible report commissioned by the committee from DKM economic consultants.</P>
      <P>To draw up this report the committee held oral hearings and received written submissions from approximately 21 top voluntary organisations in the country. We also referred to the white paper on a framework for supporting voluntary activity and for developing the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector, and Tipping the Balance, another major report on volunteerism. We did not want to reinvent the work of those reports so we studied the economic aspect of volunteerism.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation in the report is:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Dormant Accounts Fund should be targeted primarily at funding voluntary organisations, subject to the Board&rsquo;s dispersal criteria.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The ring-fencing of some CAB funds which are now coming on stream should be investigated (particularly for projects related to communities affected by the abuse of drugs and by organised crime).</P>
      <P FLI="0">Will the funds from the Criminal Assets Bureau come under the umbrella of this fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State might clarify that because they should. All funds should fall under the remit of his Department for dispersal to voluntary groups. The problem for organisations is that there are so many sources of funding. I know the Minister of State intends to streamline that, which would be very helpful because some people do not know where to go for funding. If it was all under the umbrella of one Department they could contact it directly and be directed to the correct section.</P>
      <P>Another recommendation in the report is:</P>
      <P LI="1">Ad hoc and multi-agency funding make it difficult for organisations to plan ahead. All funding for voluntary organisations and volunteering should in future be channelled exclusively through the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This would improve efficiency and transparency. Funding commitments should be entered into over a number of years. In this way the monitoring of State expenditure would also be facilitated.</P><Col N="826"/>
      <P FLI="0">That is a very strong recommendation I hope the Government will take on board.</P>
      <P>In the new regime there should be more flexibility in the guidelines and conditions for communities in a position to apply for the funding. Voluntary community groups are frustrated at not being able to apply for the funding because the guidelines are too restrictive. They provide services to their communities similar to those provided by groups in CL&Aacute;R or RAPID areas but without funding. Those in wealthy communities can get more support but groups outside those communities do not qualify for funding or find it difficult to apply for it, unless they have an educational programme for disadvantaged groups. I hope that situation will improve.</P>
      <P>I hope this legislation will provide an opportunity for more groups to apply for the fund and it does not become a political slush fund for the election in two years&rsquo; time. I hope too that it will not be abused and that Ministers and Government Deputies around the country will not use it as a way to get votes by promising grants from this fund to communities. I can imagine Deputies doing that with regard to a school or a road as a Government Deputy has a direct line to the Minister who will make the decision on it, but that is a different matter. The national lottery funds come from the people who play the national lottery. This fund comes from people who did not draw down the money and left it in banks for various reasons, and from unclaimed life assurance policies. It is important that these funds are not abused. The Minister of State is fair-minded and I appeal to him to ensure the fund will not be abused and that everybody will benefit from the change he is introducing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004. The Bill seeks to provide for the disbursement of these funds in a more focused and effective way for the purposes of tackling disadvantage. I sincerely hope it will do so. The idea of raising money from dormant accounts resulted from the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into deposit interest retention tax. Everyone was pleased that the money would be used to alleviate economic, social, educational or physical disadvantage in the community. This is something the Government and the Opposition, when it gets into power, will strive to achieve. However, the difficulty is the finite budget. If there is another fund which can be used to conquer social and economic disadvantage, so be it. The fortunes were good. The Committee of Public Accounts made its recommendation and money from dormant accounts in banks, building societies and post offices was transferred to the dormant accounts fund managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. The idea was that people could claim back their money at any time. Therefore, provision had to be made for this.</P>
      <P>The fund has worked very well. An opportunity was provided for charities to make a claim <Col N="827"/>and I understand that a minimum of 100 charities made applications. Some &euro;30 million was distributed in one year from March 2004. Some &euro;60 million was taken from bank accounts which were lying dormant for more than 15 years. The funding was distributed to many good causes, including community centres, youth clubs, playgrounds, pre-school services and so on. Half the total funds were earmarked for the Government&rsquo;s RAPID and CL&Aacute;R programmes and drugs task forces. The former Minister for Finance and Deputy, Charlie McCreevy, made this decision in 2000 and people had until March 2003 to claim the money in these old accounts.</P>
      <P>The fund amounted to &euro;172 million in January 2004, which is a great deal of money. In 2003, &euro;196 million was transferred to the fund, of which &euro;24 million had already been reclaimed by the original account holders. The idea was that people would apply for funding to Area Development Management Limited, which would assess the applications and make recommendations to the board. If the recommendations were accepted, it would negotiate with the charities on how best to spend the money. Responsibility for this lies with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
      <P>This scheme has worked well and the Government should be congratulated on setting it up. However, there should be more emphasis on older people in the disbursement of this funding. While I recognise that money has been disbursed to older people&rsquo;s causes, emigrants also need to be remembered. I have a vested interest in this regard because St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village, Mulranny, made an application for funding, which was successful. The money will be used to continue the work which is being done to support older people and carers in the community. We are trying to make things better for older people. Safe Home, the national repatriation centre, is also located in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village. This provides accommodation for more than 400 people throughout Ireland. An outreach service is provided to the general community which supports older people.</P>
      <P>This fund, which is geared towards social and charitable purposes, has been a success. It is geared towards those who work with the poorest in society, those who are socially and economically disadvantaged and people with disabilities. Approximately half the total funds are earmarked for the RAPID and CL&Aacute;R programmes and drugs task forces. This was an excellent decision given that these are the areas of greatest advantage. Whether one is disadvantaged does not just depend on where one lives, and I know the board takes this into account. The dormant accounts fund has distributed &euro;30 million since March 2003. Last January&rsquo;s tranche covered 102 projects, ranging from payouts of &euro;300,000 to &euro;880,000. This is a great deal of money out of a &euro;60 million fund from bank accounts that have been lying idle for more than 15 years.</P><Col N="828"/>
      <P>The idea of funding social, charitable and economic activities from dormant accounts is an excellent thing to do. Some time ago, Deputy Keaveney suggested that Criminal Assets Bureau funds could be used to help areas affected by crime. This would be a good way to support voluntary effort. The previous speaker referred to the value of supporting voluntary effort. Given finite Government funds, voluntary effort does not receive the support it deserves. Having worked with the national federation of group water schemes, I am very aware of the voluntary effort provided. The amount of voluntary effort necessary to set up all these group water schemes and keep them going with very little support is a great credit to communities. That these water schemes are still being run on a voluntary basis speaks volumes about the commitment of people in local communities.</P>
      <P>There is great potential in this which the Government should not forget. The Government would not be able to run these schemes from a financial point of view. Voluntary effort allows older and disabled people and so on to be supported in their communities. While there is an emphasis on supporting the private sector by providing tax breaks to people to provide facilities for older people, there should be more emphasis on empowering communities to provide these facilities. Much lip-service is paid to community care and supporting people in their communities. If people cannot be supported in their homes, they should certainly be supported in their communities. There is great potential through the voluntary housing association to provide the necessary facilities such as sheltered housing facilities. However, this depends on funding, and funds are always finite.</P>
      <P>There should be an emphasis on breaking down the barriers that prevent communities from providing a full package of support and care to older people. Capital funding is available under the capital assistance scheme for low support housing, but the defined revenue funding stream does not exist to allow older people to be supported by staff who could be employed by voluntary housing associations. Funding is not available for community groups, housing associations and so on who would wish to provide a greater degree of support for older people in their community in high support facilities. These barriers should be examined.</P>
      <P>The idea of supporting volunteers through the dormant accounts fund is a good way of dealing with this issue. It makes sense because supporting volunteers is value for money. If that effort did not continue, the Government could never replace it. This effort will not be appreciated until it is lost. The number of people volunteering is decreasing all the time. It is opportune for the Government to examine this area and provide the necessary support to volunteers to ensure the numbers volunteering do not fall and that more people are encouraged to volunteer.</P><Col N="829"/>
      <P>Programmes for the training of volunteers allow young people to engage in training to be of assistance to their community. Such work helps young people to stay out of trouble and to foster the ethic of helping and supporting one&rsquo;s neighbour, which they would have learnt from their peers and parents. Those engaged in voluntary work in the community show good example and the fewer people engaged in it, the fewer examples there are of such good work. It is extremely important that young people are supported in the community.</P>
      <P>The dormant accounts fund has contributed to such support. The fund has contributed to projects in west Tallaght on horse care. Such innovative programmes are of great benefit to communities and to young people.</P>
      <P>Other countries such as Germany have used dormant account funds in this way. However, people look to Ireland and what the Government has done in this respect. It is calculated that the UK would have at least ten times more deposits in dormant accounts than Ireland. Such funds present a great opportunity. Perhaps it is timely to suggest that the UK Government should do more to support older people, particularly older Irish emigrants, many of whom are in poor circumstances and have had little support from the UK Government. They have received good support from the Irish Government in recent years through the DION committee which has done great work in supporting our older Irish emigrants. While what the task force outlined was very much a blueprint for what needs to be done, the funds provided by the Irish Government have not been sufficient to meet what that task force clearly outlined. The UK Government also has a responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>Those emigrants did a great deal for this country. They sent home remittances, which is well documented, amounting to more than we ever got from EU Structural Funds. Those remittances constituted a fund that was available to this country to support entire communities along the west coast in particular when we had no other money. They kept entire communities alive and the lights burning over those dark years when we had no other help. Not alone did those emigrants support this country, they also supported the UK. They helped build cities and towns in the UK, they ran farms and factories, built roads and bridges and so on. Many of the men who built Britain are now living in difficult circumstances in the UK and the UK Government has a responsibility to support them. In light of the introduction in the UK of a scheme similar to the dormant accounts fund, the UK Government should not forget those Irish people. In the case of the Irish Government, this fund will be a source of funding to help Irish people at home and abroad. It is important that the UK Government meets its responsibilities in this area which, to date, it has not.</P>
      <P>A major proportion of the moneys in dormant accounts were deposited by members of our eld<Col N="830"/>erly population. Much of the money that is available to the State is the hard earned savings of an older generation who contributed to this State at home and from abroad, many of whom are no longer with us. Life was not easy for them and this State had nothing to offer them. Those who went to England were economic migrants. They had to leave this country and by so doing we did not have to look after them. We have the lowest pension bill in Europe because many of our people emigrated when we had nothing for them. We owe them a moral debt.</P>
      <P>A considerable proportion of the money in dormant accounts belonged to those people who worked hard to eke out an existence and to put money aside, whether on deposit at home or abroad, for the rainy day. They never forgot this country in all the time they were away. They lodged their small savings in credit unions and banks in towns and cities throughout Ireland. Those deposits are what constitute many dormant accounts. It is only fair that this money would be used in so far as possible to support our older people in particular. Such use of this money would serve as an apt remembrance of our older people who helped build this State and the UK.</P>
      <P>Any source of funding available for this fund, whether from dormant accounts, life assurance policies or the proceeds of the Criminal Assets Bureau, would be welcome. The moneys in the fund are being used in the right way.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, I know of people who had money illegally taken from them by the State and such moneys must be repaid to those people. However, if it is not possible to trace such people or their relatives, I can think of no place more appropriate for such money than this fund. I am not saying that those people should not have such money returned to them or to their relatives, but where it is not possible to trace them, this is a critical fund for such moneys.</P>
      <P>There are many uses to which available money could be put. The application of this fund is a good example of what can be done if money was available to do the things that really matter. For instance, it could be used to provide people with disabilities with the services they need and to give them a right to that service rather than their being dependent on what is provided in the budget. The difficulty with the Disability Bill is that it is so tied to budgetary provisions that, while many people will be assessed, thousands will not get the service they need. If there was an unlimited fund available, that would make all the difference.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of children are living in homes where the income is considered to be below the poverty line. They are living in relative poverty below what is considered to be a minimum income required of &euro;175 per week. These people are on the breadline and do not have enough food, warmth or even a second pair of shoes. We hear about those people at budget <Col N="831"/>time. We are aware of the work done by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in this area. Such deprivation exists and if money was available to address that problem it would change our society.</P>
      <P>This Bill is appropriate. I hope it continues to address the serious needs that exist in society.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill is unnecessary in that it is proposed that the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board shall be dissolved on the establishment day. That is regrettable because the fund has been used to do excellent work. To date, its use has been effective. The dormant accounts fund board makes all the decisions on where the money is allocated and those decisions are passively, so to speak, signed off by the Minster, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v. Under the new legislation, the Government will take such decisions collectively and then the Minister will approve them. I cannot see how this will operate effectively. Every Minister will arrive with pet projects in the hope of securing collective approval. It will lead to tensions and is unlikely to be as efficient as the present system.</P>
      <P>The current system is effective. After the establishment by the Committee of Public Accounts, the person who was the chairperson of the board the previous day must give evidence to the committee on any matter related to the functions of the board that arose during his term of office. The Comptroller and Auditor General is also required to carry out a detailed audit of the procedures of the board.</P>
      <P>I am critical of banks because they made little or no effort in the past to make people aware of the huge amounts held in deposit accounts. It was only following the DIRT inquiry that it became evident that the banks held substantial amounts, a fact that had to be dragged out of them.</P>
      <P>Equally, I am concerned about bank drafts that have not been cashed. The Government should look at this area because millions of euro in uncashed bank drafts that have expired are being held in deposit accounts. I raised this with IFSRA but did not receive a satisfactory answer. A person might have bought a bank draft ten years ago but did not cash it and it has since expired. The banks have been less than forthright on this matter and the Minister of State should pursue this. Millions of euro remain on deposit because next of kin were not notified when the person got ill or died. IFSRA and the Government should ask what has happened to uncashed bank drafts for the past ten years.</P>
      <P>It is important that this fund be efficient and effective. The former Minister for Finance stated that the board should be independent so I am astonished that it is necessary to introduce legis<Col N="832"/>lation to alter something that worked. It was argued that it would be more efficient but looking at the track record of financial institutions to date that is not necessarily the case.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the fund is not ring-fenced. Each county should receive allocations in proportion to the amount it contributed. It might be difficult but the banks failed in their duty to make people aware. They did not undertake local campaigns in the past ten years to inform people of bank accounts. The information was concealed in the same way the banks facilitated and accommodated off-shore accounts and they got away very lightly with that while their clients had to pay quadruple the penalties to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach opened the National Field Study Centre at Castlebaldwin prior to the last election but it closed again a few hours after his departure and has remained closed since. Funding for the centre from the county enterprise board, the European Fund for Peace and Reconciliation and the State amounted to &euro;1.5 million. It is a major scandal &mdash;&euro;1.5 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money was invested. The Minister of State will see this fantastic location when he comes to Sligo, beside the Carrowkeel megalithic tombs. It was intended that a field study would be opened up in the centre but the contract fell. Then it was agreed that the National Parks and Wildlife Service would be decentralised to it. That has almost been achieved but funding from the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is still pending. This centre is in excess of 12,000 square feet. It is fabulous, but it is a terrible waste that the centre cannot be opened because a creditor is owed money.</P>
      <P>Everyone is prepared to agree a settlement but the Minister has dragged his feet on this. I met the Minister in the past two and a half years, he made promises, failed to deliver and the centre is still closed. The dormant accounts fund, however, offers an opportunity to rectify the situation. All that is needed from the State to open the centre is &euro;200,000. If the Minister of State could bear this case in mind when considering cases worthy of support, it will create employment, &euro;1.5 million has already been spent and the National Parks and Wildlife Service has agreed to open a regional office in the area.</P>
      <P>The concept behind the dormant accounts fund is worthwhile but its independence and transparency are equally important so that it cannot be used as a political instrument. The Committee of Public Accounts must ensure the established criteria for drawing down funds are followed and that the fund will be independently audited. Over the years, Ministers have exploited the national lottery. Looking at the funding and its disbursement, it has been predominantly in the location of the line Minister of the time.</P>
      <P>We are fortunate that the voluntary sector is so effective. It is important to tap into the commitment and time given by people who work in part<Col N="833"/>nership with communities to deliver an effective service. The dormant accounts fund is the fruit of the toils of many people. For unknown reasons the existence of that fund was concealed by the financial institutions for many years. That is regrettable. However, it is important that the money is now spent where it originated. One project that clearly merits consideration at the moment is the National Field Study Centre at Castlebaldwin. That centre must be opened. I call on the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to allocate the necessary &euro;200,000 to allow the centre to be opened.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Perry as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh don m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt an tAire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Noel Ahern, nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag oscailt na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta seo.</P>
      <P>The intent of this Bill cannot be argued with given the objectives outlined by the Minister. He spoke about the importance of using the unclaimed money in financial institutions to tackle disadvantage and exclusion in society and to assist the less well-off. That is a very laudable aim. The Minister also stated that the value of the fund is approximately &euro;200 million and that some would be kept in prudent reserve in case of claims for repayment.</P>
      <P>However, it is clear that the Government has succumbed to temptation. There is talk about the principle of ensuring that decisions on the fund are informed by what is in the public interest and that they are accessible to public application and fully subject to public scrutiny. Then, unfortunately, the mask slips. There is talk about channelling the funds through the Votes of relevant Departments. The fact that the fund comes from dormant accounts is lost in the presentation of it as coming from the largesse of the Government. This happened regarding the national lottery, which is often presented as Government largesse rather than funding that has come from a public specifically motivated not merely to win a prize but also to help community projects. The Minister is to be responsible for the appointment of board members. There is a political dimension to that. The programmes are to be subject to Government approval on a list of programmes recommended for funding.</P>
      <P>The intent of the Bill is laudable but its delivery is clouded in political judgment. I imagine the public relations department of each Department will be fully employed in getting the most political benefit from how that money is spent. To that extent this legislation puts the cart before the horse. How money is dispensed on what could be called a charitable basis is something which has exercised the minds of people in this House and many outside it for many decades. I will not go into the creation of tribunals which are not directly linked to this Bill, but they may indicate <Col N="834"/>a certain mindset which has caused problems in the past and may still cause problems.</P>
      <P>The 1990 Costello report was supposedly the light at the end of the tunnel. Regulation of charitable giving and charitable organisations was to be put on a proper footing. The committee on fund-raising activities received many submissions and met many people, including former Senator, Des Hanafin, the father of the Minister for Education and Science, who at the time was heading Taca, an organisation that benefited Fianna F&aacute;il. The origins, the <i>modus operandi</i>, the checks and balances in regard to all charities need to be examined and put on a proper footing. Whether Taca could be called a charity is debatable. It shows the level of uncertainty that surrounds the charity sector. In 1996 the Burton report pointed towards the need for legislation that would regulate charities and charitable giving. Now we are debating the dormant accounts fund, another &euro;200 million to be given to various charities and other good causes, yet we still do not have the legislation that was demanded as far back as 1990 and which is promised in this House every year but which, it seems, is always to be delivered at some time in the future.</P>
      <P>I hope we can return to dealing with core issue, the proper regulation of charities and charitable giving, so that it will not be tainted by a cynical political use of that money. I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will deliver on that long held out promise to regulate the charities sector. I bet that during Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s time in Government, we will never see a proper reform of the law on charities. I hope to lose the bet. However, it is a reasonably safe bet at the moment given the length of time reform of laws on charities has been promised. I am not too sure the issue is discussed often at the Galway Races at Ballybrit. I am not even sure whether St. Luke&rsquo;s, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s base, would be regarded as a community-based charity. It would be interesting to see what its designation is. We know it is funded by philanthropic and quite discrete elements in the business community. All these need to be clearly designated and it needs to be clear what regulations cover that type of charitable giving.</P>
      <P>It would be interesting to have the minutes of Taca meetings given to the National Archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say no minutes were taken there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>That itself would be interesting. We might learn something about the official Fianna F&aacute;il view at the time regarding what constituted charitable work and charitable giving. At the moment we are discussing how to dispense money, but we do not have the regulations in place. I hope we can put the horse back in front of the cart and put legislation in place. The expected publication of the charities regulation Bill, about which I have asked repeatedly in this House, is 2005. Its purpose is to regulate charities to ensure accountability and to protect against <Col N="835"/>abuse of charitable status and fraud. It could be nick-named the <i>mañana</i> Bill because it has been going from year to year. There is no basis for believing that it will be published in 2005 even though that date is stated in black and white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, although I will have great difficulty in supporting it. It is a retrograde step to remove an independent board and place its duties in the hands of a Department. That sends out the wrong signal and will leave the Government open to the charge of political favouritism, particularly when grants are given in Ministers&rsquo; areas. We have only to look at where grants were given in the past. It may be a coincidence that, perhaps, a better quality application has come from counties Kildare, Kerry or Cork, which seem to get more than their punching weight and do well when it comes to the disbursement of particular funds and grant aid.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has tried to retrieve this money and to tackle the issue of the funds that had been lying in bank accounts and insurance companies. I suspect more money is hidden in people&rsquo;s homes and caches, effectively the savings of old people. The decision to retrieve that money and disburse it to worthy causes is admired. Another issue that is popular is that the Government is taking this money from the banks and ultimately it benefits people. Most people feel it is acceptable for the Government to take the money from banks. In other parts of the island there have been similar efforts in terms of people relieving banks of their moneys and we will hold judgment on how that benefits communities. That, however, is a different operation.</P>
      <P>In the past I would have been critical of the disbursements board for particular reasons. One can be critical of a board and how it disburses its fund, but at times I wondered whether there was political patronage involved. At no stage did I suggest we should get rid of the disbursements board. The reason I was critical was that my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan fared particularly badly. In October 2004 there was a grant disbursement of &euro;17.2 million and Cavan and Monaghan were the only two counties that did not receive funds. That sent out a bad message to us, given that a minimum of 52% was meant to be targeted at areas in RAPID, drugs task force and CL&Aacute;R areas. It was also meant to benefit those who were socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. I have no doubt that under each of those headings our constituency met all those criteria. I was extremely disappointed given that Cavan and Monaghan belong to the BMW region.</P>
      <P>Since then, I acknowledge that a reasonably substantial grant was divided between the two counties, in the communities of Ballybay and Cootehill. That is welcome and will do much for those areas. Between them, counties Cavan and <Col N="836"/>Monaghan had 15 applications, seven from Cavan and eight from Monaghan, all of which were worthy projects. These counties in disadvantaged areas appear to be at the bottom of the list when it comes to disbursement. I hope that the new group will look at this issue given that the disbursement fund accrued from areas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that an equal amount, if not more, <i>per capita </i>is to be found in the Border areas. I suggest that the disbursements board look at dormant accounts in Northern Ireland. Will the Government make an effort to ascertain whether there are such funds in banks and post offices there belonging to people from the South? It has nothing to do with dodging taxes, but for many people in counties Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, the nearest town may have been in the North where they would have done their banking. I have no doubt there are similar difficulties in those areas.</P>
      <P>The original concept of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board was that it was independent, transparent, impartial and accountable. The intention of the former Minister for Finance, now European Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, was that no hint of favouritism would attach to the allocation of grants from the fund. Given that more than 50% of that fund goes to the greater Dublin area one has to ask questions, particularly since it was meant to be targeted at CL&Aacute;R and disadvantaged areas. How disadvantaged is the greater Dublin area? The view of the then Minister that the dormant accounts funding should be distributed independently of Government was right. Why did the Government decide to change that?</P>
      <P>The board of trustees was to distribute the funds in accordance with guidelines and it was to be free from interference by the Government. In other words, canvassing would disqualify in the truest sense of the word and there was to be no possibility of the dormant accounts fund becoming a slush fund for any Government or party. Applications were to be evaluated by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, prior to board approval and drawdown of grants approved, subject to a legal contract agreement with ADM on the board&rsquo;s behalf. More than three years later the Government described the independent disbursements board as not the best one to make these decisions.</P>
      <P>Is the Government admitting that those on the board wasted millions of euro? Has it evidence that the board members are not suitable to be on the board? How on earth could it have reached the conclusion which casts aspersions on the integrity and probity of board members? Dormant accounts funds have already been disbursed to community groups across the country which fall into the categories outlined.</P>
      <P>The independent disbursements board was established to ensure that dormant accounts funds would be targeted specifically at the dis<Col N="837"/>abled, marginalised and socially and economically disadvantaged in our society. Instead it appears from the Government&rsquo;s requisitioning of the allocation of funds that the funds will become the plaything of Ministers, who will dispense them to maximise political advantage.</P>
      <P>When the idea of a national lottery was conceived in the 1970s by Joe Connolly, community games president, he did not envisage it as a catch-all benevolent fund to be allocated at the grace and favour of the Government of the day. Joe Connolly originally envisaged the national lottery as an exclusive sports fund to finance sporting and recreational facilities in Ireland. There is no doubt that had the national lottery stuck to its original agenda in the past 18 years, Ireland&rsquo;s haul of medals from the Olympic and European games would have been correspondingly larger. However, the green-eyed monster took over and the lottery funds became another example of a political slush fund to secure political advantage.</P>
      <P>I expressed the fear in March 2004 that the scrapping of the independent disbursements board would have the effect of transferring the dormant accounts to the direct control of Ministers. The temptation will always be there irrespective of which party or parties are in Government to use this fund for their pet projects in the various constituencies with the aim of mopping up the last vote. Irrespective of which party is in Government, there will be short-term gain for the Government, but in the long term it is better to leave the matter to an independent board. At a later stage when the Government is in opposition it will shout &ldquo;political favouritism&rdquo;. The Government should look long and hard at this Bill.</P>
      <P>The reasons advanced for the transfer of responsibility were somewhat less than convincing and amounted to a lame excuse. Surprise was expressed by the Government that the dormant accounts fund was in excess of &euro;180 million. It cannot have been unaware of the substantial unclaimed funds that lay in the various financial institutions throughout the country. I find this hard to believe. The Revenue Commissioners and the various tribunals have been trawling bank accounts to investigate hot money and expose corruption. An audit of the dormant accounts in the various financial institutions does not amount to rocket science. The concept of a dormant accounts fund did not just come to the Minister in a vision. The amount currently lying unclaimed in dormant accounts and life assurance policies has been estimated at approximately &euro;500 million and may be considerably higher.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s expressed surprise at the extent of the sums in dormant accounts is a tacit admission that it had bitten off more than it could chew in the management of the fund. The national debt management board does not appear to have any difficulties and enjoys a fair amount of success in this responsibility. The outgoing disbursement board consists of nine members and the board will have 11 members when reconsti<Col N="838"/>tuted. What is to prevent the Minister simply adding another two members to the existing board? I do not know why he cannot add the extra two and reach some form of compromise.</P>
      <P>The assessment process is also to be drastically altered by the provisions of this Bill. The involvement of ADM Limited will also be terminated. Why is the involvement of ADM Limited being terminated? Has it done something wrong? Is it responsible for wasting millions of euro? I do not understand this. The board is a board of repute. It has good knowledge of what happens. Instead the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will make this assessment and will call the shots as far as the assessment and approval of applications is concerned.</P>
      <P>This is a far cry from the transparency and accountability the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, envisaged when setting up the dormant accounts fund. In the past many Government functions such as judicial appointments and the allocation of State briefs have been taken out of the hands of the Government and allocated to independent bodies. This Bill is the very antithesis. Functions are being taken from an independent agency and handed over, virtually exclusively, to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. What qualifies the Department to consider cases involving persons with disabilities? Does it have specialists in the area of disability? Is the Department medically expert? Is the Department a &ldquo;Jack of all trades&rdquo; in that it can pronounce on matters and issues concerning the socially, economically and educationally disadvantaged? The Department must employ many experts and I would be interested to see their CVs.</P>
      <P>It would be a retrograde step for the functions of an independent and impartial board such as the Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board to be so subsumed. I cannot in conscience support this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this important Bill. To put it in an historical perspective, one of the first Bills I ever spoke on in these Houses was a dormant accounts Bill. At the time I was very impressed as I thought it a very novel way of having a sum of money that could be spent in difficult times. This was 20 years ago when money was much scarcer than it is now. The money could be spent on projects that would not in the normal manner of things be funded through Exchequer funding. I remember the careful analysis of that earlier Bill. It was weighed against the rights of account holders to ensure that money was not drawn into the public maw and might at some time be reactivated. Careful mechanisms were put in place to ensure that should a proper claimant arrive on the scene the money would be available to that individual or to the individual&rsquo;s estate. This has characterised how dormant accounts have been regarded.</P><Col N="839"/>
      <P>It is important to realise that the money is windfall money. It is not taxpayers&rsquo; money nor is it money that is taken from the citizens of Ireland and assigned to a particular purpose. It is money that falls the State&rsquo;s way for a very good reason, that it is better to have it for public and good use than to have it lie, unused, in financial institutions. In the past, financial institutions had benefited from holding moneys such as this over a protracted period of time.</P>
      <P>I regard the concept as extremely good. However, it brings with it a particular responsibility to ensure that the money is not treated like normal money. It should not be put into the general public fund. It should not be seen as a supplement available to line Departments. This has been the manner in which the fund has been regarded in the past. This responsibility is doubly valid now at a time of relative plenty. It should be possible to provide from the pool of money available to the Exchequer from taxpayers. This is now quite an extensive amount of money because of the economic well-being of the country. We should be able to provide for all our normal needs. Therefore, this pool of money should be used to reach communities, activities and individuals who would not be reached in the normal course of events. This presents the House with particular responsibilities, in my judgment.</P>
      <P>Many speakers have referred to the national lottery. People would regard the national lottery as itself a great success in that it has generated a great deal of money other than taxpayers&rsquo; money for good causes. However, there is great concern over the transparency attached but nobody is suggesting that a shilling has gone astray. The direct ministerial involvement in some of the disbursements means that it is not as transparent as it should be.</P>
      <P>I refer to one case of a Member, not from my party, but a Member with ministerial rank who arrived at a function with a cheque made out to a social group. The group was very surprised to receive a lotto allocation since it had not applied for one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all heard of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not good practice. I am aware that Ministers are touring certain constituencies to meet social groups and sporting and cultural groups in particular, to hear supplications in respect of lotto grants that might become available but of course, disconnected to any possible political event that might be happening. This is not the way to deal with public moneys or moneys that are available for good use.</P>
      <P>I wish to enter this caveat. I am not a believer in the view that politicians should not be involved in making important decisions about disbursement of moneys and that independent bodies are always superior to political ones. As a rule, I do not subscribe to that view. There are occasions when politicians must make decisions about <Col N="840"/>appointments or about disbursements that can be stood up and defended in this House because they are elected and accountable. Politicians often put into place mechanisms for a more transparent regime that turn out to be much less transparent in reality because of cronyism and the old pals network. At least politicians have the virtue of being accountable in this House and ultimately to the public.</P>
      <P>In the minutiae of disbursement of moneys, I believe the Government is wrong in its approach and that this legislation is unnecessary. The old maxim of, &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo; should certainly apply. It is less than four years since the Oireachtas enacted legislation providing for the establishment of an independent Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, for which a less difficult name could be suggested. The board was to have responsibility for payments from the dormant accounts fund to groups and organisations working primarily with disabled people but also in areas of economic, social or educational disadvantage. The board has not been operating for long and its plans have only really started to flow in recent years. Why are we changing tack, particularly given that, as many Members noted, the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, predicated the legislation on the virtue that the board was independent and the disbursement of funds would not be tainted with the colour of politics? What has changed?</P>
      <P>Why do we need to draw the dormant accounts fund into the maw of political disbursement? I have not heard a Deputy from the Government benches give a coherent reason for this decision. The only coherent reason is the scale of the money involved. It was all right when the fund was perceived as relatively small but the position changed when it emerged that we are talking big bucks which would have a major impact and, therefore, could colour political decisions and future voting intentions. The fund will amount to more than several hundred million euro over time, which is a significant sum.</P>
      <P>In other times, the Government&rsquo;s brazen decision to dismantle an independent and robust regime supported by the House and much-vaunted and exalted when introduced four years ago by the same Government, albeit with one or two different Ministers, would have created a greater scandal. The principle of transparency, the linchpin of the original Act, has been made redundant without a coherent reason being given, apart from the one I posited, that is, that with big bucks available the Government cannot bear not to have the levers in its hands. It is a profoundly disappointing development which would have attracted much greater public focus and anger in other circumstances. The Government is blatantly attempting to undo a good system and replace it with one which constitutes a step backwards in the march towards more transparent administration, which all Members thought we were making in all walks of life.</P><Col N="841"/>
      <P>The backdrop to this development is that we have moved forward in terms of ethics and electoral legislation, some of which has been good and some bad. The Freedom of Information Act, for example, is important legislation, even if it is difficult to live with on days such as this. It is part of the openness of our democracy to public scrutiny which is pivotal if we are to maintain public confidence in the way we do our business.</P>
      <P>This legislation is one of the few steps backwards we have made in recent times. In most cases, we have made progress in trying to create greater transparency and build confidence, although I remind the House that some of the excellent work in the original Freedom of Information Act has been rolled back, which is a pity. This Bill is in the same genre and its introduction will be regretted by the political system because it is not the correct way to proceed. People want to have confidence in the manner in which Members do business in their name. This is particularly relevant in the context of disbursal of moneys, a fraught and difficult issue.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will be present for the comments I am about to make. One of the primary purposes of the primary legislation was to ensure a focus on the disabled and areas of social, economic and educational disadvantage. The RAPID initiative was one of the instruments established in recent times to this end and was widely welcomed in the hope it would deliver infrastructure and support for disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>The Government played up the RAPID programme in my town of Wexford, which has three RAPID areas, including two large areas, Maudlintown and Coolcotts. Community groups and the public were summoned to major meetings to analyse community need and identify what people wanted. This raised expectations that needs would be met rather than exclusively debated. However, instead of allocating money to the areas in question, all of which have a tremendous sense of community, an instruction was issued to re-label all normal expenditure in the communities concerned as RAPID expenditure. For example, if a local authority builds a community house, it is designated a RAPID initiative. The expectations of communities starved of resources and in need of community facilities have been dashed.</P>
      <P>The result of this has been to create another layer of cynicism. Communities believe local government cannot deliver effectively and national Government is too remote and does not care. There has been no significant follow-through on an initiative which local community activists, voluntary groups, local authority members and officials expected to be delivered. The Minister of State will inform the House that billions of euro have been earmarked for the RAPID initiative but, as matters stand, the tax on the petrol one uses driving through a RAPID <Col N="842"/>area will be classified as RAPID expenditure in the accounting systems of the Department.</P>
      <P>I hope the genuine sense of disappointment can be undone, even at this late stage, and vulnerable communities with tremendous spirit are given the resources they need, including proper amenities and sports facilities. The new cry emanating from the health services and those interested in the health of the nation relates to the increase in obesity and diabetes among young people which has become a significant health issue for all communities. Exercise is critical in tackling both conditions, although diet and genetics also have a role in diabetes. Many communities have no sporting facilities, which links us to an issue in which the Minster of State is particularly well versed, namely, the need to identify causes. Young people have nothing to do and there is no community focus in terms of sports facilities that would absorb their natural energies. Such facilities must be established. Disadvantaged communities expect and hope to receive significant new resources but they have yet to be delivered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy posited the notion that local government should be the agent for disbursal. While this is not a bad idea, local authorities would be cynical because they were originally intended to receive part of the income of the national lottery. This great scheme involved local authorities vetting applications for lottery funding. In other words, they would inform applicants who did not qualify for funding that their applications had been rejected, while applications approved for funding would be submitted to the Minister who would announce the good news. It was a great system whereby local government would give the bad news and the Minister would give the good news. That type of system will not work in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In what year did this take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This was the practice of local government when I was a member of a local authority. Local authorities simply deemed all the applications valid and left it to the Minister to make decisions. It is important to engage local government, the members of which have a feeling for what is happening in their areas. This would be helpful in identifying particular and real needs.</P>
      <P>The Minister already has in place the RAPID structure and analysis. If analysis and identification were enough, all these problems would be solved. Now is the time for delivery. We blind ourselves with figures and statistics but local communities believe there is no follow-through. All of us are tarnished with the paint of failure in this regard.</P>
      <P>The funds in question are held in dormant accounts in financial institutions. In a week when AIB has posted the most significant profits of any publicly quoted company in the history of the State, it is essential to take a close look at the operation of banks and the banking system. We are all in favour of such institutions making pro<Col N="843"/>fits but there must also be a sense of justice and balance. There has been a significant focus on banking accounts in terms of the DIRT inquiry and the ongoing investigations into money laundering. This has generated interest in how banking and money processing are carried on. We have a responsibility in this area because we attract much foreign investment through our financial services sector. Robust instruments must be in place to ensure the State operates its financial mechanisms in an extremely transparent way. We have now begun to put the necessary resources into play in this regard.</P>
      <P>This country is blessed with a significant spirit of voluntarism as evidenced in the major army of people who give their time. Unfortunately, however, it is a diminishing crew because we are becoming more akin to the norm in other states where voluntary effort is not fully appreciated and is nothing compared with paid effort. I hope these moneys can be targeted for the benefit of those most in need, not with the taint of political patronage and the expectation of the bended knee of political payback but in an independent justice system that is based on the analysis of real needs and transparent delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with everything my colleague, Deputy Howlin, has said and with the views expressed by all speakers from the Opposition side of the House. Everybody is gobsmacked and flabbergasted by the blatant introduction of this Bill, the stated intention of which is to remove from an independent board the responsibility to disburse the windfall funds from dormant accounts and to put that power within the political patronage of the relevant Minister, in this case, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is blatantly stated in its Title:</P>
      <P LI="1">An Act to amend the Dormant Accounts Acts 2001 and 2003 to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Dormant Accounts Board and to define its functions; to reform the processes by which decisions are made about disbursements, and moneys are disbursed, from the Dormant Accounts Fund; and to provide for the dissolution of the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board and for related matters.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The legislation abolishes the existing board and makes provisions and plans as to how the money will be allocated and spent within a straight political context.</P>
      <P>The new board will consist of a chairman and ten members, all appointed by the Minister. It seems no independent nominating body could be trusted to make these appointments and no community organisation trusted to make a nomination. The function of the board is to present a plan to the Minister who may then amend it and <Col N="844"/>must approve it. Moreover, the Minister may also determine the plan. Sections 42(4) and 42(7) essentially stipulate that the board may make a proposal to the Minister but it is the Minister alone who disposes in regard to the plan itself. This is before we even come to the process of disbursement.</P>
      <P>The parameters of the programme, plan and projects, therefore, will be within the gift of the Minister. The legislation proposes an emasculated board which will be appointed by the Minister and tightly under his or her reign, and that the Minister may change the board&rsquo;s plan if he or she deems it unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the point in having a board? The Minister is effectively cutting out the middle man so he can make the decisions himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McGinley makes an interesting point. The purpose of the establishment of the new board is to give the appearance in the public arena of transparency. An emasculated board is to replace the independent board in a move designed to convey the pretence of an accountable structure. In reality, however, the only person who can adjudicate and disburse funds is the Minister. It is with the latter that all power will rest.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Ministers must have functions of responsibility and leadership. However, it is not democratic that only the Minister can make funding allocations and that the associated board is akin to a man of straw whose purpose is to give the impression of some level of accountability. This is not the way to disburse funds. Notwithstanding that the funds in question are windfall funds, they are also citizens&rsquo; funds, moneys that have been lying dormant in banks and other financial institutions and monetary schemes which have never been activated. They do not quite represent taxpayers&rsquo; moneys but are nevertheless citizens&rsquo; funds which should be disbursed in accordance with reasonable accountability and criteria.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is setting up the parameters and structures for what can only be described for a slush fund. He should be ashamed to present such blatant and brazen legislation to the House. I have never seen a proposal of this nature. What makes it so blatant and brazen is its purpose of dissolving the independent machinery set up by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, to ensure there would be transparency and accountability in this matter. We are talking about hundreds of millions of euro which have lain dormant in financial institutions for a period. We are transferring moneys from an accountable body to an unaccountable creature of the Minister. Essentially, it is the Minister who will distribute these funds. Somewhere in the bowels of the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation, a think tank is preparing for the next election. More than anything else, Fianna F&aacute;il is keenly aware of how to get people <Col N="845"/>elected by cleverly addressing local politics. Nothing beats a couple of slush funds in the run-up to an election. At the local elections several months ago, both Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, got a hammering. The Government sees that steps must now be taken to ensure it will not happen again. One way is to provide large sums of money for the relevant Minister to dispense in a carefully selected fashion to maximise electoral return for the Government.</P>
      <P>The special savings incentive scheme, set in motion by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, is another element in this slush fund approach to be realised in 2006. While taxpayers have invested in the scheme, 25% of taxpayers&rsquo; money to the Exchequer will still be paid out by the Government. This particular slush fund will come on stream just before the next general election. The good feeling of money coming from the Government is intended to bring about a desired electoral result. Deputy Howlin detailed the remarkable situation whereby local authorities had a certain role in the dispersal of funds from the national lottery through the sports capital programme. However, it was removed for the exclusive authority of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. Several slush funds are now nicely in place to pour money in great waves at the people most likely to be needed to vote the right way in 2006, the year of the slush fund.</P>
      <P>The Government is transferring power from an independent accountable body to a non-independent, powerless body under the Minister&rsquo;s control. Will the House be informed of any other reason why the dormant accounts fund must be handed over to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs? I cannot think of any but I would be delighted if he could so I can retract all I have said on the matter.</P>
      <P>All Members recall the run-up to the last general election when RAPID co-ordinators toured the length and the breadth of the country, assembling local communities in every parish hall. They requested communities to detail projects they wanted in their areas, to explain what facilities were necessary. It was said the RAPID programme would improve everything. Money was no problem since &euro;2 billion was earmarked in the national development plan for the programme. Every community was told of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Finding the end of the rainbow turned out to be the problem. The money was never realised and when the 2002 election was over the promises were never delivered.</P>
      <P>In today&rsquo;s published Estimates for public services, RAPID will receive &euro;8.8 million for 2005 to cover both current and capital programmes. Last year, the figure was &euro;3.3 million. The promise was of &euro;2 billion but in reality it is &euro;3.3 million. What a lie to perpetrate on every disadvantaged community.</P><Col N="846"/>
      <P>This fits in perfectly with the argument that this Bill is another RAPID programme. However, in this case the money will be delivered as the slush fund exists. The RAPID programme was a promise that could not be met. Since it suffered at the local elections, the Government will not be caught out a second time with non-delivery. It sees slush fund delivery on a large scale as the answer.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is scandalous. If the public only knew what was going on, there would be an outcry with calls for the resignation of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and his Ministers of State, Deputies Noel Ahern and Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. The Oireachtas is brought into disrepute when legislation is introduced that no Member can defend. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions are similar to an all-powerful tinpot dictatorship giving handouts to the peasant, cap in hand, begging for the dispersal of funds. In this case, the all powerful coalition Government hands out the funds it thinks appropriate to the deserving poor in disadvantaged areas so that they will be grateful when the next general election comes around. The Oireachtas demeans itself by passing such legislation which lends to public cynicism as to what we do in the Houses. With a Bill of this nature, it is frustrating for Opposition Members because there is nothing we can do. We can speak out but it is like voices crying in the wilderness. The numbers are not there to prevent the Bill being passed. The purpose of the legislation is to ensure the numbers will still not be on this side of the House to amend this Bill in the future.</P>
      <P>Communities are also suffering from this frustration. By serving on my local drugs task force, I know the national drugs strategy never got off the ground because of the lack of a sure source of funding to employ people on a regular basis to carry out the strategy&rsquo;s work. Funding was irregular and the local drugs task force did not know from year to year whether somebody who was employed would be employed the following year. It never knew whether a project for which it had applied for funding would be funded. Since I have been on the local drugs task force for the past number of years, no more than 50% of funding sought has been granted. Part of the reason was the matter was not taken seriously and there were cutbacks. Funding for the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund was severely cut back but there is now talk of funding coming on stream. I have no doubt it will come on stream and I do not expect anymore cutbacks between now and the general election in 2006 or 2007. If I went into Paddy Power&rsquo;s tomorrow, I could put &euro;10 on that and be absolutely certain that would be the case.</P>
      <P>The communities have been let down over the years. Funding has not been forthcoming, although commitments have been made. Community organisations which were there to help out and to liaise with State agencies did not get the support they needed. There is a degree of disappointment, frustration and cynicism. The Mini<Col N="847"/>ster will now be able to turn on and off the tap in terms of the disbursement of these funds whenever he wishes. Much money from the dormant accounts fund is going to disadvantaged communities but it will now go to such communities exclusively at the behest, grace and patronage of the Minister.</P>
      <P>Funding for community co-operatives, which were outside the House protesting the day before yesterday, is being cut off despite the good work they have been doing. These co-operatives are doing very useful community work. The Minister will be able to pick and choose. He will be able to say to such groups that they are not being supportive in the way he would like, that they are too independent, that they are making too many statements and that their publications are critical of the Government and that as a result, their grants will be cut off and the disbursement of funds for staff and projects will end. This Bill allows that to happen and that is the problem with it.</P>
      <P>This is a bad day&rsquo;s work and we will vote against this legislation. I hope we will be in power after the next general election and that one of our first acts will be to dissolve this legislation which dissolves the 2001 and 2003 legislation and the independent structures in place so that they can be replaced by non-independent, non-transparent and patronage-style structures which undermine and usurp democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions in which some interesting points were made. I noted the views expressed. I do not think everyone who spoke read my Second Stage speech because I made it plain that the purpose of this legislation was to build on the progress made and to rectify deficiencies in the system. I noted the spin some were putting on this legislation. It is easy to talk about disappointment, cynicism and frustration but those talking about such things should ask if they are the cause of them and not this proposal from Government.</P>
      <P>The dormant accounts have given us an opportunity to address many problems of educational disadvantage and social exclusion. That is the point on which we should concentrate. We all know the economy has done very well over the past ten years as have many people. However, not everyone has benefited and funds such as this give us the opportunity to concentrate on them and to try to do some good work. That was the thinking when the Government introduced the dormant accounts legislation four years ago and it remains the thinking, that is, to distribute the money to areas and groups most affected by disadvantage in society.</P>
      <P>When the dormant accounts fund board submitted the disbursement plan to the Minister and the Department, the principal amendment made by the Minister and the Department was to <Col N="848"/>ensure that a significant element of disbursements would specifically target the most disadvantaged areas. We laid down ground rules that a significant proportion of the money would have to be spent in RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas. Obviously, that has resulted in complaints which I heard today and on the previous occasion. Some Members said their constituencies did not get enough. It is hard to design a system whereby everybody is happy. I could look at what a board, group or Minister might do and perhaps agree with 90% of it but say I would do 10% of it differently. Even today Members came at this from different points of view. Some said how wonderful the current system was but in the next breath, they complained that their constituency and the project in which they were interested did not get funding. It is hard to get everything right but it is important that the funding is clearly targeted at those most in need.</P>
      <P>Concerns were expressed as to the extent to which the changes in the Bill will adversely affect the impact of spending from the fund. Deputies McGinley and O&rsquo;Shea questioned the reasoning behind the legislation and made the charge that we were trying to form a slush fund, which I totally reject. Nothing could be further from the truth. In many respects, politics is a gas game. Charlie McCreevy has received many glowing tributes since he left but when he was here he was criticised, which we do to one another. It is extraordinary that a quote he made some years ago is now constantly used, although perhaps not in the sense he made it. It is extraordinary how we value and appreciate his comments now he has gone but when he was here he was slagged, which we do to one another.</P>
      <P>I explained why the changes are being made. The size of the fund has influenced thinking. The structure set up for a fund of a particular size changes if that fund turns out to be much larger than originally envisaged. Deputy Deenihan spoke about re-activations. I think the financial institutions originally identified &euro;420 million, which was whittled down. I am surprised the community group in his area was not contacted by the bank because when the financial institutions went through the old accounts, they contacted people. One of my country cousins was phoned by the bank advising of an account that had been dormant for 25 years even though it only contained a few hundred pounds. Efforts have been made and I was surprised to hear Deputy Deenihan speak of a person in a small community group not having been contacted. However, this can still be done and the account resurrected. A sum of &euro;420 million was originally identified by the financial institutions, which was significantly reduced by the success of the financial institutions in tracking down the account holders.</P>
      <P>The Government has a duty to ensure that the arrangements for disbursing such large amounts are robust and adhere to the best standards of corporate governance. Having reviewed the <Col N="849"/>arrangements late in 2003, it became clear to Government that obvious deficiencies existed in the structures, which I outlined in my original contribution. These related in particular to accountability arrangements, an organisational structure for the board and linkage of spending from the fund with policy priorities of Government. Policy priorities of Government are important and are influenced by views expressed here, including those of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>I do not know why we criticise ourselves and feel that anybody except us can do a perfect job whereas anything we do is somehow tainted. It most certainly is not. We all deal with communities and have considerable knowledge about influencing how Government policy should be directed. I agreed with a point Deputy Mulcahy made about ADM, which has been used by the board to administer and process the applications up to now and may continue to do so. Somebody mentioned that we had got rid of ADM. However, the Bill is neutral on the matter. We may or may not use ADM; that is a matter to be decided from time to time. Deputy Mulcahy referred to ADM contacting people and said it had never contacted him for his views on an application, which is an interesting point. I have heard of ADM contacting many other people to check on applications. He has a point in suggesting that ADM or such organisations should communicate with public representatives, be they Deputies, Senators or councillors, of all political persuasions. A cross-party check will yield a view as to whether a particular group is good or not so good. I do not know why we belittle and criticise our opinion and always feel everybody else&rsquo;s opinion is perfect and that we have nothing to add.</P>
      <P>Under the new system the funding will be provided through the Votes of individual Departments and therefore the relevant Secretaries General will be accountable. It was a deficiency in the original Bill and most unfair to expect a part-time chairman who has given enormous time to the board or anyone in such a position to be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for enormous expenditure. If we allowed that to continue and a problem arose in two, four or five years&rsquo; time, we would hear hollers from whoever happened to be in Opposition at that stage asking how a Government allowed such a structure to exist. This approach in the Bill ensures that the expertise, knowledge and capabilities within existing public bodies will be utilised in administering the funding programmes. In future decisions by Government will take place following a transparent decision-making process, which will ensure that spending from the fund will be co-ordinated with policy priorities identified by Government and debated in the House and at committees.</P>
      <P>Deputies Keaveney and Deenihan spoke about the very good report on volunteering recently published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on <Col N="850"/>Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The Department is examining the report and we hope to make an announcement in that regard in the near future. I agree with Deputy Deenihan that other funds should be added to this dormant accounts fund and he highlighted money taken in by the Criminal Assets Bureau. Some community groups spend half their time chasing Departments and Government agencies and looking through various programmes to try to source funds for their activities. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established principally to co-ordinate many of these schemes. I am glad to hear that the Opposition believes that it would be better from a State administration point of view as well as from the point of view of the groups trying to source funds to know that they only had to knock on one door. Having obtained their funding, the groups could spend 95% of their time using the money for the activities for which they were originally established.</P>
      <P>The negativity of some of the speakers was incredible. One would wonder why people try so hard to be elected to this House. I used to have a sticker on a filing cabinet that claimed there were three types of people in the world: people who want to get things done; people who observe what is being done; and people who spend their time wondering what happened. Some people believe in making an input here in an effort to make things happen and improve the lot of the communities in their constituencies. Others just seem to want to complain and talk about what is wrong and are more content in getting on their soapboxes and complaining about what is wrong in their constituencies without wanting to do anything about it when they have the opportunity. I find that way of thinking to be rather strange. We should collectively have more confidence in ourselves and try to make a greater input into decisions like this.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a two-stage process through which the Government will make decisions. The Minister will make an initial proposal to Government based on the board&rsquo;s disbursement plan outlining the programmes and types of projects for which applications will be sought. Applications received will be assessed against published criteria and then submitted to Government for final decision. A list of approved projects will be published, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and will be available for people to discuss. The key monitoring functions of the board are set out in the Bill, including that the board will review and assess the extent to which the objectives it sets out in the plan are being achieved. The board will also track Government decisions and make detailed reports which will be available to the Opposition and the public based on whether the allocations have been in accordance with the disbursement plan. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that moneys are directed at the most disadvantaged groups and communities <Col N="851"/>in the most efficient manner, using the expertise accumulated in Departments and agencies. That is what we are doing. We have to try to maximise our use of the fund, which is finite and will not last forever. We could have put in place an enormous structure to administer the fund, but there would have been no point in doing so because we would have been stuck with that structure when the fund dries up in a couple of years. It is obvious that we should use the knowledge and expertise available in Departments and agencies.</P>
      <P>Deputies Lynch, Costello, Howlin and others spoke about the RAPID programme. It is extraordinary that Deputies have attempted to find some significance in the provision of &euro;8 million under the Estimate of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. That money has been provided for relatively small items which were identified by local RAPID groups. The RAPID programme was developed to fast-track major infrastructural projects which are being developed by Departments and various agencies in disadvantaged areas. Deputy Costello claimed some minutes ago that the Government is claiming credit for assisting projects under the RAPID programme which would have happened anyway. It is easy to make such an allegation.</P>
      <P>As part of my role as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I have visited housing projects in Deputy Costello&rsquo;s constituency and elsewhere. I refer to expensive remedial work and regeneration schemes, which have upgraded the standard of living of many people on both sides of the River Liffey. It is easy for Deputies to claim that such projects do not pertain to the RAPID programme and would have been developed in any event, but that is untrue. Various communities have proposed projects of all sizes under the RAPID programme. The small projects are being funded as well. I accept that the programme was slow to get out of the starting blocks when there was an economic downturn between 2002 and 2004. The ideas and plans which have been proposed are being implemented and are having a big effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and others spoke about the average amount that has been allocated to each <Col N="852"/>constituency from the dormant accounts fund to date. He asked whether the fund should be used to support flagship projects or smaller projects. Applications of all sizes were made to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, which assessed them on the basis of the information supplied to it. For example, the board considered whether the applications were in accordance with its disbursement plan. Some Deputies who complained about the changes being made to the current system said that certain constituencies, such as Cavan-Monaghan, received very little. The board has not operated on the basis of geographical considerations. A politician might operate in such a manner, but I do not think such matters were considered by the board as they did not fall within its remit. There are different ways of doing it and it is hard to have it all right.</P>
      <P>Many speakers spoke about the distribution of national lottery funds. I do not have the full details of the manner in which that money is distributed. There seems to be a general belief that all national lottery money is allocated to the sports capital programme, but that is most untrue. I am somewhat surprised to learn that various funds, programmes and projects under the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are funded by national lottery money. Although there is no political involvement in such projects, some people like to suggest that there is political involvement in the allocation of all lottery moneys. That is not the case. We are doing politics a huge disservice by talking like that.</P>
      <P>I took note of the many points which were made, some of which were reiterated by other Deputies. The Government believes this Bill is essential. It builds on the previous legislation in this area. The wise changes being introduced will correct the faults in the original legislation. I listened carefully when the Bill was amended and passed by the Seanad. I look forward to considering it further on Committee Stage. If Members have good ideas for further improvements to the Bill, I will consider appropriate amendments to that effect. I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P><Col N="854"/>
      <P>I am delighted to present the Land Bill 2004, which was passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann last October. This Land Bill is designed to achieve several objectives. The main thrust of what I propose is a further and final, equitable means to address long-standing difficulties with the collection of land purchase annuities. I want to resolve the ongoing accrual of land annuity arrears by providing for a reduction in the numbers of land purchase annuities, and more effective collection of any remaining annuities in the future.</P>
      <P>I propose a write-off or buy-out offer for annuitants, which will be of direct financial benefit to thousands of farmers. I also want to make it easier for trustees of general and sporting trusts to transfer trust land without having to bear the legal and financial responsibilities themselves. I intend to reduce red tape by providing for greater administrative operational flexibility and reducing some of the expense involved in completing land transfers.</P>
      <P>To put these measures in context it is important to give some historical background. The Irish <Col N="855"/>Land Commission was established in 1881. It was originally a rent fixing body, but its main business became that of facilitating transfer of freehold ownership of land from landlords to their tenants. It examined the landlord&rsquo;s title, paid him or her the purchase money and vested the freehold interest in the occupying tenants.</P>
      <P>As many tenants did not have access to sources of capital to pay for the land, the concept of the land purchase annuity was introduced. Capital was provided to tenants by the former Land Commission and repaid by the tenant owner by way of an annuity spread over a term of years.</P>
      <P>These capital advances or mortgages played a very important part in bringing about tenant ownership of agricultural land. The Land Commission radically altered the face of rural Ireland. In the process, the juxtaposition of the absentee or powerful landlord against the powerless agricultural tenant was fundamentally changed. Tenants became owners of their land and ongoing structural reform improved the re-arrangement and enlargement of holdings. Overall two thirds of the land in the State, some 5 million hectares, changed ownership with the assistance of the Land Commission, a body with which the issues of land ownership and land reform are synonymous.</P>
      <P>By the early 1980s it was generally accepted that the Land Commission had achieved its primary objectives. Accordingly, it was decided to terminate acquisition of further land and actively dispose of the remaining lands on hand. The Land Commission was eventually dissolved by the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act of 1992, which came into effect on 31 March 1999.</P>
      <P>Since the transfer of the Land Commission functions to the Department of Agriculture and Food, officials have continued to wind up the affairs of the former Land Commission. This Bill is a further step in that task. The measures in this Bill deal primarily with better administration of annuities; easing the transfer of trust lands; reducing bureaucracy and reducing the cost of conveyancing transactions for all agricultural land.</P>
      <P>I am pleased this Bill meets one of the commitments to the farming sector in the partnership process under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the Sustaining Progress Agreement. In bringing forward this Bill, the Government is fulfilling the commitment to introduce a Land Bill on the operation of land purchase annuities and the management of former Land Commission lands.</P>
      <P>One of the principal aspects of the Bill is the land purchase annuity write-off in section 2. I propose to make legal provision for the write-off of all annuities of &euro;200 per annum or less. As a result of this provision two thirds of all existing annuities will be written off. The measure will benefit more than 4,500 annuitants at a cost to the Exchequer of approximately &euro;4 million an average write-off of nearly &euro;1,000 per farmer. <Col N="856"/>The good news for some 4,500 farmers is that they will no longer be liable for further half yearly payments to the Department and their land will not have the burden of an annuity attached to it.</P>
      <P>Under the Sustaining Progress agreement, the Government committed to reducing the burden of the land purchase annuities. By introducing this provision, I am going far beyond the Government commitment, as I am removing the burden altogether for two thirds of all annuitants. In section 3, I propose a further incentive to encourage the remaining farmers who have land purchase annuities to take the final step towards fully owning their land and finally achieving the primary objective of the former Land Commission namely, tenant ownership of agricultural holdings, that is, full unburdened title to the land with all the advantages that full ownership entails.</P>
      <P>When this is enacted, a scheme will be introduced to allow those farmers with land purchase annuities of more than &euro;200 per annum to buy them out. Some 2,300 farmers will be able to avail of this concession, to redeem their annuities at a substantial discount of 25%, subject to their annuity payments being up to date. The scheme will operate for six months, starting in the spring and ending in late autumn of 2005. Precise dates have not been set.</P>
      <P>The Department does not require clear title from farmers, who wish to avail of the buy-out scheme. Those annuitants, however, who wish to raise finance to avail of this offer may need to show clear title to their bank or other financial institution in order to obtain a loan. These farmers will have, in effect, a timeframe of almost 12 months to regularise their title affairs and I urge them to attend to this without delay.</P>
      <P>The Department will contact each annuitant personally in due course to advise him or her of the scheme. The farming organisations can also play their part by drawing their members&rsquo; attention to this offer. The yield to the Exchequer as a result of this measure could be as much as &euro;18 million, depending on the numbers who avail of the buy-out scheme. This measure has the capacity to alleviate an existing debt problem for certain farmers and improve the financial situation of most annuitants. I encourage farmers to consider what is a final offer very carefully. It is, however, just an offer. Those annuitants who wish to continue to pay their half-yearly instalments to the Department, on time, can continue to do so. Farmers should discuss the attractive benefits of this offer with their financial advisers with a view to obtaining capital to pay their purchase annuity redemption price and improving their overall financial position.</P>
      <P>In addition to reducing the number of annuities it is necessary to provide greater control measures for the future collection of annuities owed, in the interests of the taxpayer. As part of this initiative on annuity compliance, section 4 makes legal provision to set off any grant or sin<Col N="857"/>gle payment entitlements due to farmers by the Department, against annuity payments that are owed and not discharged. Before these set-off provisions will be utilised, there will be a comprehensive consultation process with the annuitant concerned. These powers will not be applied without notice being given to the annuitant and in a proportionate manner, if applied. Furthermore, section 5 provides that individuals with land purchase annuities will be required to present a certificate of compliance to the Land Registry in cases where they propose to dispose of all or part of any land subject to an annuity. The Department will furnish such certificates only where arrears outstanding have been cleared or, preferably, the entire annuity redeemed. I will deal sympathetically with cases where sites are being transferred to family members without financial consideration.</P>
      <P>I also propose in section 6 to amend section 28 of the 1933 Land Act. The new provision will enable the Department to recover payment of arrears of annuities from defaulters by way of application to the courts, in cases where such moneys are not recoupable, except through payment owed to the defaulter by third parties. The proposal will provide that a warrant issued under section 28 of the 1933 Land Act may take the form of an attachment of debts by garnishee order or the appointment of a receiver by equitable execution, following an application to the court. Being facetious, I advise it is best to stay out of the court and take up the offer. That would make life simple for all of us.</P>
      <P>These improved collection measures will not be implemented without a prior attempt to come to some voluntary arrangement with individuals regarding their arrears position. Every case will be dealt with on its merits and there will be genuine consultation and a sympathetic approach adopted by the Department in bringing about payment resolution by consensus. It is not the intention of this legislation to bring about hardship for annuitants and the ability to pay will be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I want to resolve the problem of land annuity arrears. These control measures are designed so that action can be taken against individuals who refuse to pay for the land, which they purchased through the former Land Commission and who have consistently failed to discharge their repayment commitments. It is worth pointing out that currently there are 49 cases amounting to almost &euro;1 million in arrears.</P>
      <P>The total amount of annuity arrears owed to my Department amount to approximately &euro;5 million. In summary, the write-off and buy-out incentives would be rendered meaningless if they were not accompanied by new powers to safeguard the taxpayers&rsquo; interests. We must ensure that all revenues outstanding are paid.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the next element of the Bill dealing with easing the transfer of trust land. This is land held in trust under the Land Acts, usually <Col N="858"/>for sporting or general community purposes. I propose to simplify conveyancing procedures to ease the transfer of title ownership, by removing the legal and financial burdens from trustees. There were approximately 500 of these local trusts set up by the Land Commission, some of which have been disposed of over the years. Local GAA and other sports clubs use almost half of these trusts. The balance is mainly turbary trusts and cow-park trusts, which were established to provide some communal land for keeping animals by those in rural communities who did not actually own agricultural holdings.</P>
      <P>In the case of the sporting trusts, because the sporting organisations using the trust lands do not own the property, they are reluctant to commit to significant development of, or investment in, the trust property. As a result, many properties are not maximising their potential benefit to the community in which they are situated. The measure I propose should greatly facilitate the legal transfer of these lands from trust to actual user ownership, which should allow greater development of these sporting and other local amenity facilities, and ultimately benefit the whole community. There may be as many as 200 trusts interested in availing of this measure and I recommend that other trusts should also consider the benefits this measure offers.</P>
      <P>Vesting orders are the means by which the Department transfers land into the ownership of the person or persons named in the order. Section 28 of the Land Act 1931 currently provides for publication in the prescribed manner, which is costly, onerous, cumbersome and ultimately results in delays. I propose a technical change to be made to legislation governing the publication of vesting orders by repealing and replacing section 28, with a requirement to publish only a notice of the making of such orders while still continuing to forward copies of the vesting order to the individuals concerned or their legal representatives. This will lead to speedier transfer of land and administrative improvements.</P>
      <P>At present, certain statutory instruments, known as rules under the Land Acts may only be made following the convening of the rules committee. When this provision was introduced, the Land Commission was separate to the Department. Its workload was heavy and it was sensible for all relevant parties to meet and consider new proposals. However, since the dissolution of the Land Commission, there is little point in having a law that specifies that two officials, the Secretary General of my Department and an assistant secretary, must meet the President of the High Court before a statutory instrument is made. I propose to amend section 3 (1) of the Land Act 1933 and remove the necessity of having to convene meetings of the rules committee, in favour of my Department consulting the President of the High Court or his nominee, as Judicial Commissioner and the President of the Law Society, before making rules under the Land Acts.</P><Col N="859"/>
      <P>On the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I propose to make amendments of a technical nature in sections 10 and 11. In section 10, I propose to provide a statutory base for Government decisions made in 1989 and 1992, whereby small amounts in respect of land purchase annuities-land reclamation annuities were written off. At the time, the write-off was introduced on an administrative basis, but as annuities have a legal base it is prudent to provide a legal basis for the write-off. There are no implications for the beneficiaries and the measure is merely to provide legal certainty.</P>
      <P>In regard to section 11, I propose to provide a statutory basis for the Government decision in 1992, which approved concessions to land purchase-land reclamation annuity payers where they were offered the opportunity to buy out their annuities at a discount. However, there was no provision in existing legislation authorising the Minister to accept less than the full amount to buy out such annuities. In order to provide this, it is necessary to introduce this measure in the Bill. As with section 10, there are no implications for the beneficiaries of the measure except it confirms their position in law.</P>
      <P>On subdivision control of agricultural land, it is proposed to repeal section 12 of the Land Act 1965. The control on the division, letting or leasing of agricultural land was first introduced when the former Land Commission was primarily concerned with the elimination of congestion and fragmentation of agricultural holdings. The Commission achieved the enlargement, consolidation and re-arrangement of holdings to a viable size, through the compulsory acquisition of land and its subsequent re-allotment. Subdivision control was a logical concomitant to the process of enlarging and maintaining such holdings in order to prevent landowners from disposing of their property in a manner incompatible with the State&rsquo;s agricultural policy. As long as the former Land Commission was active in redistributing land, there was logic in controlling any increase in the number of smallholdings whose owners could then join the long queue of applicants for Land Commission land.</P>
      <P>The State policy of enlarging holdings was aimed at creating viable farming units. It was a policy that was appropriate for its time as it was logical for the State to protect its investment by controlling the indiscriminate division of holdings. As the State is no longer engaged in acquiring and redistributing land, there is no need for continuing sub-division control. In fact, time has shown that economic factors lead to the consolidation of holdings, rather than their continued subdivision, as evidenced by the increasing size of farms in the State. Let me provide an example. In 1973, the average farm size was 23 hectares. By 2002, it had increased to 32 hectares, an increase of almost 40%. As a result, the granting of consent has now become a formality and in no <Col N="860"/>case in recent years has consent been withheld. However, as section 12 of the Land Act 1965 has not been repealed, solicitors for landowners, who wish to subdivide or lease their land, must still apply to the Department for consent, giving rise to more than 15,000 applications per year to the Department and additional costs for the landowners. The abolition of subdivision control will save landowners legal and other costs involved in making subdivision applications. In addition, there will be a visible benefit in the reduction of administrative time incurred by staff in issuing the relevant section 12 consents.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to repeal section 45 of the Land Act 1965. For historical and cultural reasons, foreign investment in land, particularly non-resident foreign investment in the State, was a sensitive issue. Prior to the Second World War, there was no restriction on the purchase of land in the State by non-nationals. However, after the war, primarily due to changes in the tax laws in the United Kingdom, there were increasing purchases of agricultural land by non-nationals. This trend met with strong resistance from owners of small uneconomic farms who had hoped to acquire, with the assistance of the former Land Commission, the lands being bought by non-nationals. Section 45 consent was introduced as a result of this pressure and the rationale was to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of land to Irish nationals and long-term residents and to prevent the creation of a class of non-resident landowners.</P>
      <P>In practice, a section 45 consent is required in all agricultural land purchases, which is all land except that which is wholly situated in a county borough, a borough, an urban district or a town. Consent is not required where agricultural land is being purchased by a class of persons known as &ldquo;qualified persons&rdquo; as specified in section 45 of the Act. For example, an Irish citizen or someone who has been resident in the State for a period of seven years is deemed to be a qualified person. On Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the European Community, it became obvious that the restrictions on purchases of land by non-nationals, or more specifically by nationals of other member states, imposed by section 45, were contrary to our freedom of movement and establishment obligations under the Treaty of Rome. As a consequence, various statutory instruments have over the years extended the categories of qualifying individuals for whom consent was not necessary. These changes and the cessation of land acquisition by the former Land Commission in the early 1980s further reduced any justification for withholding section 45 consent, so much so that the issue of consent has become a formality. No applications have been refused for several years, but because the section has never been repealed, some 300 applications are received and processed each year. More importantly, in conveyancing transactions solicitors have to establish the nationality of their client, insert the appropriate nationality certificate in the deed of purchase or, in limited <Col N="861"/>cases, apply for a formal consent for their clients and perhaps charge their clients accordingly.</P>
      <P>I want to end this unnecessary red tape and bureaucratic expense in checking nationality for the small number of non-qualified persons or companies seeking a consent. Nationality certificates will no longer be required in deeds of purchase for any land purchased in the State. Section 13 contains the Short Title, construction, collective citation and commencement date.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill provide for a potential contribution to the Exchequer by way of a capital lump sum being paid to it, will significantly reduce the burden of land purchase annuities for a significant number of farmers and reduce the administrative burdens on the Department permitting staff to be redeployed to more urgent and productive areas.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the Bill also provide for the removal of the burden of annuities for many farmers, better administration of land annuities, simpler vesting of trust land and rule making and a significant reduction of bureaucracy and costs involved in completing land transfers. For all those reasons I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is a long time coming and is welcome. The Bill requires dramatic amendment but I accept and welcome the principle of it.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the content of the Bill, I compliment the 33 staff who work in the lands division. As public representatives we have all had dealings with the lands divisions in Cavan and with regional inspectors on numerous occasions. We have examined issues to improve the public service delivered. Many civil servants could take a leaf out of the book of the staff in the lands division, whether they be the staff in Farnham Road in Cavan or the regional inspectors, in terms of the manner in which they deal with queries from public representatives. It has always been a pleasure to deal with those staff.</P>
      <P>However, a major difficulty is the inadequate resources available to them. On average there are fewer than one and a half staff members per county to deal with the number of queries concerning the processing of applications. There have been numerous instances where young people building houses on applying for a mortgage have found that they do not have the proper title and the application is held up in Cavan, although the staff there have been extremely proactive in addressing that problem.</P>
      <P>To pick up on one of the Minister&rsquo;s final points, I hope that the staff in the lands division will not be redeployed but that they will be reallocated to address the huge mess in regard to the issue of title. The transfer of title causes major delays in the processing of applications.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the Land Commission was originally established in 1881 as rent fixing body under the Land Law (Ireland) Act of that year. It subsequently developed into a tenant pur<Col N="862"/>chase agency and purchased 13.5 million acres of land for tenants. Eventually the commission embarked on a countrywide programme of land structural reform but, as we are all aware, that was not without controversy. There were significant controversies.</P>
      <P>Some people allege that the dormant accounts fund, which we discussed earlier when dealing with the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill, will become a political slush fund, but the Land Commission was its predecessor in that respect and significant allegations to that effect have been made over the years. The fact that the commission&rsquo;s acquisition of land ceased in 1983 was a positive development. Such acquisition restricted farmers who genuinely wanted to expand their operations. In many cases, the Land Commission stepped in prior to sales being closed and deals being done.</P>
      <P>While such acquisition facilitated small farmers, which must be acknowledged, it restricted more progressive farmers who wanted to expand their enterprises. There were a number of controversies over compulsory acquisition of land where land was leased. I know of one family of three sisters who lived quite close to my home who leased land. That was one of their sources of income at that point, but the Land Commission stepped in because that land was being leased. However, it annoyed and hurt the family in question that the tenants who received that land subsequently let it to the individual who had been renting from the sisters in the first instance and nothing seemed to have been done about it. There have been other similar instances over the years.</P>
      <P>This legislation is long overdue. The Government gave a commitment in 1993 under a partnership agreement to address this issue, but it has taken 12 years for this legislation to be introduced. Sustaining Progress contained a commitment to ease the burden experienced by farmers who were paying land annuities. This legislation does not address that core principle. While the Bill attempts to bring forward measures to cut the existing number of land annuities and it provides for those with annuities of under &euro;200 per annum threshold, it fails to address the core element of people with outstanding annuities. The issue of annuities will not be resolved by the Bill. The discharge of the land purchase annuities for those with annuities of &euro;200 per annum is a positive development that will benefit approximately 4,500 farmers. The majority of these holdings are small in size and the annuities attaching to them are very old.</P>
      <P>It has been calculated that the staff costs involved in collecting the full capital sum of these annuities, if paid on time over the next 14 year period, would roughly equal the amount to be collected. There is a great deal of paperwork involved in collecting annuities. If this measure is taken up, it would eliminate much of the paperwork involved. If the current costs of recovery <Col N="863"/>and staff costs I outlined are correct, it is uneconomic to collect annuities of under &euro;200 per annum. Surely it makes economic sense to propose a write-off of annuities of under &euro;500 per annum. It is not uneconomic to collect those annuities now, but with additional collection costs in coming years, such a write-off would make economic sense.</P>
      <P>This system is still paper-based and will continue to be if there is a significant uptake of this measure because it does not make economic sense to computerise the system. Will the Minister to re-examine the threshold proposed? It would not involve a massive cost to increase the threshold from annuities of &euro;200 per annum to those of &euro;500 per annum, but the savings from doing that would be significant and result in a return that would make such an extension of the measure cost neutral.</P>
      <P>The second and probably the most controversial element of the Bill is in regard to farmers with annuities of more than &euro;200 per annum who will be able to redeem them at a discount of<?oasys _jy?>25%, subject to all outstanding arrears being paid in full. Those farmers will have the opportunity to buy out their land at a discount of 25%. Approximately 2,500 farmers have annuities of more than &euro;200 per annum. If there is a full up-take of this measure, it would be yield a return of approximately &euro;18 million to the Department and, as a result, two thirds of existing annuities would be written off.</P>
      <P>The period of six months for the take-up of this measure is inadequate. The Minister knows that and does not need me to tell her. It is proposed to introduce it in the spring of 2005 and that it will be open up to the autumn of 2005. Either the Minister is prepared to proceed with this or she is not. If she is, the least she must do is extend the timeframe for the take up of it until the introduction of the single farm payment. That is a basic element. It would at least give people the opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated in her speech that the Department does not require title. No bank will give money to farmers unless they have title. Trying to get title is a major issue in the delays when a young couple are applying for a mortgage.</P>
      <P>The Minister also says they must have this resolved within six to eight months if they are to avail of the discount. That is impossible. If the Minister contacts her colleague in the Department of Transport, he will tell her that the NRA retains money for property it has compulsorily purchased over the years because title still has not been sorted out. The timeframe should be extended to two years, giving farmers time to put the financial arrangements in place to allow them to buy their annuities, to tap into the single farm payment and to sort out ownership title where there are disputes or ambiguities.</P>
      <P>The 25% reduction in the buy out price is not enough and the package needs to be more attract<Col N="864"/>ive if we are to have a maximum take up by farmers. The option to buy out the annuities affects 2,500 farmers and the discount should increased to 50%, as it was in 1992-93 when the buy out discount on the outstanding capital was offered to each annuitant who was not in arrears at that time. The main cohort who will take this up are people who were in arrears in 1992-93 who could not avail of the buy out clause then.</P>
      <P>The Department is offering no assistance to those farmers with significant arrears. The last buy out scheme did not address the issue and neither will this. People who got land did so to make their farms viable. The majority were small holders who could not get loans from the bank because they would not have had adequate credit ratings. That is why they were involved with the Land Commission in the first instance. Farmers who owe significant arrears to the Department cannot participate in this buy out scheme until those arrears are paid but the Minister is giving six months to pay the arrears, six months to get the title in order and six months to raise the finance to buy it out. It is impossible.</P>
      <P>The total amount in arrears due to the Department from farmers with annuities over &euro;200 per annum is &euro;3.6 million, an average of &euro;1,565 each. There is, therefore, no reason why a flexible approach cannot be taken by the Department. The element that would have to be written off &mdash;&euro;3.6 million &mdash; is less than the amount being written off for annuities under &euro;200 per annum, which will cost the State &euro;4 million. Will it cost the State any less to collect that &euro;3.6 million over the number of years? The Minister&rsquo;s own debt collectors are charging a fee of 20%. If the Minister is prepared to give a private company 20% to collect the arrears, the least she could do is ensure the farmers get the same discount on their arrears if they come up with a full and final settlement. No offer is being made to them for any discount on arrears but the Minister is prepared to give it to a private company. That is unfair. At the very least they should get the same offer as is being given to private debt collectors.</P>
      <P>The interest rates on arrears are significantly higher than rates currently available. They vary from case to case but some are as high as 18% given that they were contracted with the Land Commission in the 1970s and 1980s. No repayment is less than 11% per annum, significantly higher than rates available from the commercial banks. The loan sharks would not squeeze people as tight as the Department has done over the last number of years with significant interest rates and no assistance being given to waive the outstanding arrears.</P>
      <P>The Department has ignored this issue for many years. It did not go out to collect the money from farmers but brought in debt collectors to do it. It is a paper based system and no financial institution still works on that basis. There is a huge financial burden just to administer this <Col N="865"/>scheme that has not been fully recognised in the discount offered to farmers.</P>
      <P>A number of things can be done for those in arrears. Agreement should be reached on a payment plan over a number of years with little or no interest. The State can borrow at the ECB rate of 2% while farmers are paying at least 11%. The farmers who currently owe significant amounts of arrears may not be able to meet these debts or be able to afford to buy into the opt out so the 25% reduction will not be available to them. The Minister should capitalise the overall debt along with the outstanding annuities and give a 25% discount on that, particularly when she is giving a private company 20% to collect the money. It is getting a commission that the Minister is not even prepared to give to farmers.</P>
      <P>For those farmers who cannot choose to take up the offer and decide to continue to pay the annuities, the Department of Agriculture and Food must provide help and assistance to repay these debts in a structured manner.</P>
      <P>The provisions under sections 4 and 6 twist farmers&rsquo; arms to pay arrears. I was interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this in her speech. In section 4, she states that the powers will not be applied without notice being given to the annuitant in a proportionate manner if applied but it does not say that in the Bill. If it did, we could accept it, or if she introduces an amendment on Committee Stage we will accept it, but she is not talking about that here. In the past farmers from Malin Head to Mizen Head were penalised by provisions introduced here to get the cowboys in the system. The heavy hand was not supposed to be used on genuine farmers but when the provisions were introduced, the exact opposite happened. If the Minister wants to bring in sections 4 and 6, and she is serious about giving farmers every opportunity to make repayments before invoking those sections, she should write it into the legislation rather than merely commenting in the House, because as soon as the legislation is passed there will be different interpretations of it. I hope the Minister will introduce relevant amendments.</P>
      <P>The legislation allows the Department to claw back headage payments, premia payments and the single farm payment from farmers who have annuity debts. Many farmers are paying extortionate amounts of money for store cattle and weanlings. I do not see how they can make a profit from them. Therefore, the only income they will have this year is what they get by way of premia payments and the single farm payment, and it is that income the Minister is taking from them. Many have other loans and suppliers to pay. Could the Department feasibly take someone&rsquo;s farm retirement scheme payment under this legislation? Is it possible that these powers might be extended to other Departments in the future so that, for example, social welfare payments could be tied into it? The Department of Agriculture and Food is essentially talking about an attach<Col N="866"/>ment of earnings, taking a payment from a farmer by deducting it from moneys that are due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs did it for 40 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will have an opportunity to speak later. We can debate this in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not prepared to do that in regard to people who have broken the law. People have gone to jail for not paying a fine imposed for not having a dog licence or a television licence &mdash; they cannot pay by instalments because the Minister will not make provision for that. However, the Minister is introducing this here to provide legal powers to support the Jensen case. The difficulty is that these are extremely extensive powers. Section 6 gives power to take money from third parties in the form of, for example, creamery cheques. This is a more extensive power than the banks currently have. It could leave farmers in severe financial difficulty, and there are no protections such as the Minister spoke about in the legislation. It is important that such protections are in place and that this power comes into play only when due and full consideration has been given to every other available avenue and the payment plans have been adopted and accepted by both parties. That is not the case. This protects the Department by supporting the decision of the European Court of Justice in the Jensen case. The purpose of this legislation is to make that decision legal in Ireland and I believe it is questionable.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to some other elements of the Bill. The Minister mentioned that approximately 500 properties are held by local trusts set up by the Land Commission and that many properties are not maximising their potential benefit to the community in which they are located. The measure proposed by the Minister to facilitate the transfer of trust lands will be of huge benefit to GAA clubs and other sporting clubs where there has been a question over title. However, in a number of these trusts around the country there is major controversy regarding how lands have been utilised over recent years. Will this measure provide them with a blank cheque to do what they like with lands once they get the title in their name? This is something we need to tease out on Committee Stage. I want to see those lands utilised for the benefit of communities. In one town the community decided to offer the land as industrial land to attract investment and everyone in the community has benefited. In another town where an industrialist was prepared to come in, the trust refused to give any land and that town is literally dying. This issue needs to be examined in further detail and can be teased out on Committee Stage. I would not like to see the proposed measure abused but I can see how it might be of genuine benefit to a community.</P><Col N="867"/>
      <P>The repeal of section 12 of the Bill is a positive measure because it is pointless for the Department to continue to have a role in controlling the subdivision and letting of lands.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to section 45 of the Bill. Under EU regulations any EU or EEA national can buy land here. Therefore, the provision applies only to people from outside those areas. I have no difficulty with anybody from any part of the world buying land here, but I have a difficulty with people who buy land and then seem to believe they own the whole countryside, whether they are from the European Union or outside it, or have come down from Dublin. The Minister knows exactly what I am talking about. I have come across cases where people from Dublin come down to the country and when slurry is spread &mdash; not pig slurry but ordinary cattle slurry &mdash; they complain to the local authority and world war three breaks out. People must realise that if they are going to live in the country they must accept some of the practices there. I have no difficulty with someone coming to live in a community, but they must buy into that community and look at issues from the point of view of what is in the interests of the community rather than what is in their own interests.</P>
      <P>Farmers need to be more conscious of planning applications in rural communities. In one instance a young man had no difficulty with someone building beside him. However, the only area where he could spread slurry was on three fields surrounding the site in question. He entered on observation on the planning file. The developer signed it and has no difficulty with slurry being spread. If he had not done that, in the context of the nitrates directive, that individual could have been in dire straits. The Department of Agriculture and Food needs to take a more proactive approach to the structure of county development plans to ensure that farmers are protected. We are not talking about an abuse of the system. If farmers break the law they should be dealt with in the same way as everyone else. However, where common agricultural practice is taking place, that should not be prohibited or farmers persecuted for it by individuals around the country.</P>
      <P>On the provisions of the Bill generally, it is proposed to repeal and replace section 28(1) of the Land Act 1931 which relates to vesting orders. I hope this issue is simplified. Would it be possible before Committee Stage to examine the structure of the notices issued to individuals? An elderly man of 80 years of age came to me in the past couple of months when one such notice was issued to him in the post. It was like double Dutch to him so he brought it to me. I have seen many such legal documents over the years and am fairly well up to speed on such matters, but I could not decipher it. There is not much point in sending such notices. If the notice stated that somebody down the road was getting the parcel of land next <Col N="868"/>door and asked whether he had an objection to it, he could make a decision. However, the notice as it is set out is indecipherable and needs to be explained in plain English.</P>
      <P>My final request to the Minister is to recognise her staff in Farnham Road in Cavan. They are excellent, but they are currently working in extremely difficult circumstances. They should be given the additional resources they need to continue to do their job. The Ceann Comhairle is well aware of the type of work they have done in recent years. They are a credit to the Department of Agriculture and Food but should be given the resources. If not, huge problems will be caused which will restrict the implementation of the legislation given that the issue of title will not be resolved for many individuals because the Minister&rsquo;s officials will be unable to address it.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the action he intends to take to stem the tide of job losses in the manufacturing sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>World trade, global investment flows and consumer decisions influence the pattern of economic growth, company development and job prospects here. In recent years I recognise that Irish manufacturing firms, particularly in the more traditional sectors, have operated against a backdrop of significant downward price pressure and an increasingly competitive international environment. I have to recognise that some firms, which are unable to generate sustainable returns from the modern Irish economy, will inevitably be attracted by lower cost environments abroad.</P>
        <P>In the same period we have become a more sophisticated and developed economy, where technology and intellectual endeavour are becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for future enterprise and growth. A process of structural evolution is inevitable as our economy maintains a dynamism to grow and expand employment across different sectors. This inevitably brings some plant transfers and other adjustments. Because of the importance of manufacturing, we cannot afford to be complacent about any consistent erosion in employment in such an important economic sector, nor about the impact on employees affected. Manufacturing remains at <Col N="869"/>the heart of overseas investment and is likely to do so for a considerable time.</P>
        <P>While there is no denying that manufacturing employment has declined we must view these losses against employment expansion in the broader economy. The latest quarterly national household survey, quarter 3, 2004, shows that the total at work rose by 57,400 to more than 1.893 million in the year. Total employment has increased in each of the past five years. Some 227,800 more people or an extra 13.7% were at work in the June to August quarter last year, than in the corresponding period in 1999. This is a remarkable achievement at a time when there is considerable debate and comment about the impact of competition from lower wage economies on employment levels in developed economies.</P>
        <P>The focus of enterprise policy must concentrate on developing sophisticated activities that will justify continued levels of high income and productivity. These will allow us to maintain current levels of economic growth and living standards. Key to this is greater and more intensive investment in skill levels and a concentration on activities that are innovation based rather than production led. It is up to entrepreneurs to make these decisions, but it is the role of Government to design the framework conditions that will help them succeed and maintain an economy in which it is attractive to do profitable business in and from Ireland.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>For manufacturing and the services sector, sustainable employment will be based on competitiveness, higher productivity and the application of technology and skill in both existing and new enterprises. The challenge for my Department&rsquo;s agencies is to assist companies move into higher value added activities and help up-skill employees that will provide more sustainable employment. The enterprise development agencies have been clearly mandated to align their operations around this policy objective.</P>
        <P>The enterprise strategy group recognised the potential for high value added manufacturing to be a key driver of employment and growth in the future as part of a new strategic direction for the economy. Earlier today, I announced the main findings of the Government concerning implementation of the ESG recommendations in which advanced manufacturing will play an important part. As part of this process I will make regular reports to Government on progress in implementing the ESG&rsquo;s prescriptions, which are imperative to providing the enterprise economy with the momentum for continued prosperity and profitability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister what action he intends to take to stem some of the recent job losses in the manufacturing sector. We are all aware of the progress made in recent years and <Col N="870"/>the level of job creation. However, during the past three months there have been a number of job losses as follows: 220 at Circum Solutions in Clondalkin, 70 at Smurfit Papermills in Clonskeagh, 55 at Parian China in Ballyshannon, 250 at Greencore in Carlow, 350 at Allergan in Westport, 200 at APW Enclosures in Tallaght and an announcement that 150 jobs will be lost at Castlemahon Foods in Limerick. That is a total of 1,094 job losses in the past three months and a worrying trend in the manufacturing sector. We have been warning for many years of the cost base required for Ireland to enable it compete against lower cost-based countries in the Far East, eastern Europe and China. The Minister will be aware from his recent trips, particularly the one to China, of the huge challenge for the manufacturing sector. I ask the Minister to co-ordinate a series of policies to keep costs down, not the 27 stealth taxes and charges introduced in recent years which need to be put aside. Waste management and energy are serious cost issues and there is not enough competition in the telecommunictions area. Will the Minister outline his proposals for policy changes to ensure Ireland is competitive in the manufacturing sector?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Earlier today I announced the Government&rsquo;s consideration of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report and the endorsement of the broad thrust of its recommendations. That will involve a fundamental and significant restructuring of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s structures, so far as they pertain to overseas marketing and the supports it can give to Irish small and medium-size companies in terms of internationalisation. The internationalisation agenda will be key to the growth and competitiveness of Irish-based companies in the future. They will have to go out and get a presence in markets such as China, which they are doing, thereby guaranteeing core activities at home and at corporate headquarters.</P>
        <P>In addition, the key for Ireland will be research and development and innovation and in terms of attracting foreign direct investment we are endeavouring to bring a greater amount of research and development investment into both existing multinational companies in Ireland and in any new companies we can attract into Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy read a list of company closures. We have had company closures for many years. However, every year we have also had significant job creation. Already in the first two months of the year we have had announcements of seven major overseas companies wishing to locate in Ireland. The sectors will change where jobs will be created. As the economy changes and as we move up the value chain the job profile will change and in particular sectors there will be stronger growth than in others. A classic illustration is financial and international services which grew 68%, from 39,800 jobs to 67,100 jobs between 1999 and 2003. That is a dramatic increase in a short period in the financial and international services sector. We will concentrate <Col N="871"/>on high end manufacturing and the innovation agenda is key to that.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by a number of trade unions regarding alleged abuse of immigrant construction workers; the steps he is taking to ensure that all such workers receive their full entitlements and are covered by all appropriate worker protection laws; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6381/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of concerns expressed by a number of trade unions regarding alleged abuse of immigrant construction workers, and where such cases were brought to my attention I have asked the labour inspectorate to pursue the matter.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain <Col N="872"/>records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure on behalf of the employer to maintain adequate records is an offence. I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the construction industry are governed by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order, which is enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department. In this regard the rate of pay which can be enforced in respect of construction operatives under the terms of the registered employment agreement is &euro;7.36 per hour.</P>
        <P>Enforcement of the provisions of a registered employment agreement may also be effected under the Industrial Relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied the employer is in breach of a registered employment agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
        <P>Where employers seek work permits to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires a statement of the main functions of the job: salary or wages, deductions other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is evidence of intention to comply with minimum wage legislation. Applications for work permit renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid. Form P60 and other sources are used for this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent and shocking abuse highlighted this week concerned EU nationals who do not require work permits. These are Polish workers who were exploited and paid half the going rate and whose case was highlighted so well and so forcefully in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> this week. Despite receiving threats of legal action for exposing this abuse, why did it require the <i>Irish Examiner </i>and SIPTU to address and resolve this issue instead of the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department or its inspectorate? How can he justify that the labour inspectorate, the body that audits compliance with labour law, carried out 30% fewer inspections last year compared with the previous year? In 2004, 5,160 inspections were carried out and 7,168 in 2003. At a time when a substantial number of additional workers are coming into the economy, fewer inspections and monitoring of conditions are being carried <Col N="873"/>out. Is the Minister of State aware that the Polish Embassy has stated it is inundated with cases of exploitation from Polish workers who are EU citizens? Is he aware that the case for non-EU citizens is even more scandalous, as highlighted in the report of the Migrant Rights Centre, the details of which I know the Minister of State has in front of him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I met representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre and I am aware of the findings of its reports. I am also aware of the allegations by the Polish workers. To the best of my knowledge, only one complaint has been received in the Department from the Polish Embassy. This was in respect of a company in Wexford. The case was successfully prosecuted in the courts and is under appeal.</P>
        <P>The Department encourages workers, by whatever means and which quite often might be by way of embassies, to contact the Department or the labour inspectorate to bring abuses of this nature to the attention of the Department. It is only in circumstances where legislation is broken that the Department is in a position to pursue these cases further. There are difficulties to do with the rates of pay which have not been resolved because a related matter is before the courts. The rate has not been updated since 1998 which is a very considerable time.</P>
        <P>The Deputy raised the matter of inspections. During last year there were three factors which militated against the number of inspections. A number of the labour inspectors were promoted and moved elsewhere, some were involved in the Irish Presidency and a number were also involved in a very detailed re-examination of the role and functions of the inspectorate which took some man hours. The number of inspectors has been increased from 17 to 21 recently. I anticipate the number of inspections to be carried out this year will be considerably in excess of last year&rsquo;s and probably in excess of the year before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The core of the issue is that the Minister of State seems to believe it is everybody else&rsquo;s responsibility to find breaches of the legislation rather than his Department&rsquo;s responsibility to be proactive, to have sufficient inspections carried out and to have sufficient inspectors. Does he accept that is his responsibility and he should not leave it to investigative journalists or to the trade union movement to do his job?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would expect the Deputy to be aware that the increased number of labour inspectors was agreed in the previous partnership agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is wholly inadequate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nevertheless it is an agreement and I do not wish to be the one who kicks out a partnership agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="874"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated, where embassies or others have complaints to make, they should bring them to the attention of the Department or the labour inspectorate. The inspectorate goes to great lengths to pursue cases but it needs to have the evidence to put before the courts to effect successful prosecutions. This requires the co-operation of a large number of people, including the specific employees where necessary, and possibly their representatives.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the Government has failed to ensure the enforcement of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s ruling that a company (details supplied) must divest itself of its 24.9% shareholding in another company.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6433/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In October 1994 the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment requested the Competition Authority to undertake a study into competition in the Irish newspaper industry. On 30 March 1995, the Competition Authority reported its findings to the then Minister. One of the conclusions and recommendations of the Competition Authority was to the effect that the acquisition by Independent Newspapers plc of a 24.9% interest in Irish Press Newspapers Limited and Irish Press Publishing Limited and the provision by Independent Newspapers plc of loans totalling IR£2 million to Irish Press represented an abuse of a dominant position by Independent Newspapers plc contrary to section 5 of the Competition Act 1991 and also an anti-competitive agreement under section 4 of the Act. However, it is important from the point of view of legal precision to point out that a study of this type does not lead to a ruling of the sort mentioned in the question. The Irish Press newspapers ceased publishing in May 1995, two months after publication of the report, and no action was taken on foot of the authority&rsquo;s recommendation. Legal proceedings have been initiated against the Minister arising out of a statement made by my predecessor in 1996 concerning the Irish Press titles. Those proceedings remain extant and in these circumstances I consider it inappropriate to comment in more detail in regard to this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Irish Press group cannot go back into business even if it desired to do so because of the ownership situation. Does the Minister agree that in no other area of Irish business is there a situation to match that of the tax exile, Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, and his almost complete domination of the newspaper market? For example, Independent News and Media plc owns <Col N="875"/>67% of Irish daily newspapers and almost 87% of Irish Sunday newspapers. Is there a commitment from the Government to deal with abuses of market power in the newspaper industry? Does the Minister agree that the media monopoly operated by Independent News and Media plc involves an abuse of its dominant position and in which it can influence the political process? This was alluded to in the Moriarty tribunal.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in response to similar questions previously, a number of developments will impact on the future role of Shannon Development. The most significant of these are the proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon as part of the decentralisation programme, the enterprise strategy group recommendation that Shannon Development disengage from industrial development functions and the establishment of an independent Shannon Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>The new airport authority was incorporated in October. As I previously indicated, Shannon Development fully supports the decision to establish an independent airport authority and agrees it is vital to the economic development of the region. The company has further agreed on the need to refocus its activities on the airport with a view to generating business for the airport and to the use of its assets to support the airport authority, particularly in its early vulnerable years.</P>
        <P>A number of options were identified by the working group established last July to examine the specific issue of how Shannon Development <Col N="877"/>could best contribute to the development of the new airport and these remain under consideration. Shannon Development and the new airport authority have engaged in direct discussions on the matter and work under way on developing the business plan for the new airport authority will help inform the optimum relationship between the two agencies.</P>
        <P>In light of these developments, the Shannon Development board has been asked to devise a new strategy for the company. I understand this exercise is at an advanced stage and the strategy will be submitted to me in the near future, following which I plan to have discussions with the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister indicated he recommended that Shannon Development disengage from industrial development in the region. Has he identified who will replace its industrial development activities? While he stated that Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland would do so, as he is aware, the activities of the latter focus mainly on attracting foreign investment, while the former does not have a property base in the region. Shannon Development has good projects, including the e-towns programme, knowledge networks and Shannon Broadband.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that Shannon Development&rsquo;s assets should be used to support the airport authority in developing Shannon Airport. Shannon Development&rsquo;s rental income from its property in the Shannon free zone is approximately &euro;8 million per annum. I understand that it requires &euro;30 million to upgrade its properties in the zone. How will this affect the activities of Shannon Development?

	<P>The recommendation that Shannon Development disengage from industrial development functions in the region was made by the enterprise strategy group rather than by me. The Shannon Airport Authority and Shannon Development entered into direct discussions on this matter in late 2004 and these are ongoing. It also employed a consultant to determine with greater precision costing elements and funding issues<i> vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the airport and Shannon Development and the likely revenue stream available.</P>
        <P>I have held meetings with several Ministers with a direct interest in this question. We are examining the overall context for Shannon on the aviation and industrial sides and endeavouring to produce a solution which will have the support of all concerned. We are anxious to achieve consensus on the future of Shannon Development in co-operation with local interests. That is the current position. The process is still under way and involves the Ministers for Transport and Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Killeen, who, as a representative for the area, has a particular interest in this matter and particular insights to offer, as does the Minster for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that continuing uncertainty is having a negative impact on the Shannon region? Last week, Pan European Communications closed down with the loss of up to 100 jobs in the region. What role does the Minister envisage for Shannon Development? I believe the answer is &ldquo;none&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to Enterprise Ireland, which will not move to Shannon in the near future as it does not feature in the first or second round of decentralisation. He may have commissioned many reports and held many discussions, but an air of gloom hangs over the region as regards the regional focus for Shannon Development. On what should the company focus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No air of gloom should hang over the area given that the job market in the mid-west is improving. Shannon Development participated admirably in the recent trade mission to China. I attended a very successful function it hosted for the Chinese authorities and was impressed by its presentation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chinese Government, not the Irish Government, invited Shannon Development to take part in the mission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Shannon Development was part of the Irish trade mission. It gave a good presentation on the issue of regional development in which the Chinese have a historical interest. The ultimate objective is to get the best package to guarantee increased sustained employment in the mid-west region.</P>
        <P>The change in the status of Shannon Airport and the establishment of an independent Shannon Airport Authority is a significant development for the area which was broadly welcomed by business and industrial interests in the region. The key issue is the necessity to underpin it in future because Shannon Airport is probably the most important infrastructure in the region. Issues must still be worked out and this is being done. I am allowing discussions to take place at local level and await responses from other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Transport, before finalising the issue.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he is taking to address the notorious unemployment problem in County Mayo, particularly north Mayo; if his attention has been drawn to the hardship caused by the loss of jobs at companies (details supplied); the steps he has taken or intends to take to provide replacement jobs in the region; if, in view of this matter, he will consider setting up a task force to address this urgent situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recent job losses announced by companies in County Mayo are a major blow to the workers affected and their families. I am conscious of the adverse effects of such closures on the surrounding area. Every effort will be made by F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies to find and create alternative employment for people who have been or are due to be made redundant.</P>
        <P>At 5,495, the live register figure for County Mayo for January 2005 shows a decrease of 11% compared to January 2004. While the live register is not a true record of the level of unemployment, it is nevertheless a useful indicator of the current employment trend. Furthermore, the most recent quarterly national household survey figures, third quarter 2004, shows an unemployment rate for the west of 3.8%. That is substantially down on the 4.8% figure for 2003 and is below the national average figure of 4.7%. These figures reflect the overall upward trend in the economy in recent months.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland continues to actively promote County Mayo to potential investors from a variety of sectors, including manufacturing and international services, with every effort being made to secure new investments for the area. Since January 2004, there have been seven first-time site visits to the county by potential investors.</P>
        <P>In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland continue to work with the existing base of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities. The Mayo County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses to develop indigenous enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity at local level.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>IDA Ireland is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focused property solutions in the west region, specifically County Mayo. This is viewed as an essential marketing tool in the process of attracting potential new investors to the county. IDA Ireland is developing world class business and technology parks in Ballina, Westport, and Castlebar. The goal is to ensure that key locations have the appropriate property solutions, tailored to specific key sectoral targets, to attract inward investments. This means providing high quality business and technology parks and buildings in the main towns and undertaking long-term planning with the local authorities in order that the region is viewed by investors as having location solutions, such as property, infrastructure, business and lifestyle services, to support the growth and development of their operations. Given the representation of the State development agencies on the Mayo County Development Board, it is considered that, should further co-ordination be necessary, the county development board would be the most appropriate forum to fulfil this function. In the circumstances, I do not propose to establish a task force for the region.</P><Col N="880"/>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>I recognise the need to provide high value employment opportunities in the key towns in Mayo that provide sustainable long-term jobs. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategies have proved successful to date despite the difficult and ever-changing global economy. The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in Europe. IDA Ireland is confident the strategies and policies being pursued in the county together with the ongoing commitment to regional development will bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply. County Mayo is the most socio-economically deprived area in the country. The Minister quoted figures in regard to the west but the latest statistics indicate that the western and northern regions of Mayo are in terminal decline, having lost thousands of their population.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Cowley will talk the statistics to death.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Hundreds of jobs have recently been lost in Hennigans, Allergan and the Bellacorrick peat-burning station. If one considers the losses at Bellacorrick, approximately 1,000 jobs have been lost in the area in the past five years. By contrast, three new power stations are being developed in the midlands while the Bellacorrick facility is closing with the loss of more than 200 jobs. A recent study indicated that 8 million tonnes of peat are available at Bellacorrick. In this context, there can be no reason not to rebuild the peat-burning station there.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that Mayo is the national employment blackspot, with a relative poverty rate 40% above the national average. Will the Minister acknowledge the existence of this employment problem in Mayo, particularly in north Mayo and Ballina, and will he prioritise this area as a location for job creation? We have seen approaches made to industrialists providing jobs in this country to ask them to relocate in China. Will the Minister consider the employment supports available for the overpopulated pale and provide better employment prospects for the west? Will he support the rebuilding of Bellacorrick, which has adequate stores of peat? It is the Minister&rsquo;s job to act and if he does not do so, the well-being of the next generation in this area is under threat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We must stop using such language as &ldquo;deprived&rdquo; and &ldquo;most deprived&rdquo; in this debate. It does not serve the interests of Mayo as we endeavour to market the county. IDA Ireland is not in the position described by the Deputy. The factual position is that unemployment is down 11% from 2003 to 2004.</P>

	<P>My question relates to north County Mayo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland is quite benign about the prospects for Mayo in coming years. As I outlined, it has taken decisions regarding the development of business parks, for which the total amount invested will be &euro;11 million by the end of 2005. IDA Ireland is currently at an advanced stage in the acquisition of 27 acres of land on the Sligo Road in Ballina for the development of a high quality business and technology park. Planning permission has recently been approved for the site development and IDA Ireland is finalising the purchase of the site from Mayo County Council, at which point tenders will be invited from the private sector for site development works. It is expected this work will commence in 2005. This is an important infrastructure for Ballina, which will enable IDA Ireland to attract companies into a fully serviced and developed site of world-class quality.</P>
        <P>Likewise, a 16-acre state-of-the-art business and technology park has been fully developed at Castlebar and is being actively promoted by IDA Ireland. In Westport, IDA Ireland has acquired 37 acres of land where it plans to develop a new business and technology park. Work is in progress on site development there and it is anticipated that the first phase will be completed by mid-2005.</P>
        <P>These developments represent tangible evidence of the commitment of IDA Ireland and the Government &mdash; it is the Government which funds all this &mdash; to Mayo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is funded by the taxpayer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are committed to building on what is now a significant cluster of foreign direct investment activities in the county, particularly in the medical technology area, with companies such as Baxter Healthcare, Allergan, AMO Ireland, Hollister, Fort Wayne Metals and Charles River Laboratories. These have given a certain strength to the Mayo area. In addition, AMO Ireland announced the establishment of a shared services centre in Westport. The Castlebar campus of Galway Institute of Technology is another significant infrastructure, on which IDA Ireland has worked to provide an incubation facility for business start-ups. This is an important new development taking place in all the institute of technology campuses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>The loss of 1,000 jobs, including those at Bellacorrick, in five years is significant. Will the Minister give his support to the peat-burning station in Bellacorrick? The peat supplies available will provide more than 200 jobs for 15 years. This would be a wonderful development for the area, which will replace what has been taken away. The Minister&rsquo;s support in this regard is extremely important.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>the action he intends to take to bring alternative employment to Tallaght in Dublin on foot of the impending closure of a company (details supplied) with the loss of 200 jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6198/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much regret the recent announcement by APW Enclosures that it will cease production at its plant in Tallaght, County Dublin, by June 2005. F&Aacute;S has been in contact with the company and has offered its full range of services to those who will lose their jobs. In addition to services provided from its Tallaght office, the agency also offered to make its staff available on site, to give vocational guidance and help.</P>
        <P>The industrial development agencies are continuing to market the Tallaght area for new jobs and investment. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major foreign direct investment projects, moving up the value chain. Tallaght continues to be actively marketed by IDA Ireland to potential investors and is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with Tallaght Institute of Technology and superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle.</P>
        <P>Wyeth Biopharma has approximately 700 people employed in Clondalkin and this figure is expected to rise to 1,300 by the end of the year. The Japanese pharmaceuticals company, Takeda Chemical Industries, which will employ 60 people, has also begun construction in Clondalkin. At Citywest, project developments by SAP support services, AOL Technologies Ireland Limited and Colgate-Palmolive support services are providing 750 locally accessible job opportunities.</P>
        <P>Following an agreement last year, Enterprise Ireland is supporting the development of business incubation space at the institute of technology. This facility is expected to generate quality start-up enterprises. The development agencies con<Col N="883"/>tinue to work with existing companies to assist them to move up the value chain and increase employment potential. Companies which have availed of this process, with financial assistance from IDA Ireland, include Sage and Xilinx in Citywest.</P>
        <P>Job losses and job gains have always been, and will continue to be, part of the economic landscape. However, our overall unemployment rate is among the lowest in Europe. In that context, it should be noted that the latest CSO live register analysis shows that those claiming unemployment benefits in Tallaght fell from 3,631 in January 2004 to 3,214 in January 2005, a drop of 11.5%.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied the strong infrastructural support already in place, including the opening of Luas, will continue to attract jobs to Tallaght and the surrounding area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would expect the Luas to take people out of Tallaght rather than bring them to it. It can work both ways. I am concerned with the 200 job losses in the company in question rather than the other activities the Minister mentioned. He is getting fond of IDA Ireland-speak of &ldquo;moving up the value chain&rdquo;. Such sentiments are of little comfort to the 200 employees in Tallaght who will lose their jobs.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister consider some initiative in conjunction with Tallaght Institute of Technology, particularly in regard to the commercialisation of research and development? Establishing linkages between industry and the third level sector, as the Minister mentioned, is a positive approach. One must wonder what purpose F&Aacute;S retraining courses will serve. In instances of job losses on this scale in any part of the country, a proactive plan should be in place based on a template that has worked in the past.</P>
        <P>The company involved has cited higher costs as the cause of the job losses. Will the Minister indicate if he has more specific plans than what he has said in a general way to ensure those affected will be given employment opportunities in the general area as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already indicated that Enterprise Ireland is working closely with the Institute of Technology Tallaght in encouraging the commercialisation of research. It has supported the development of business incubation space at the institute to the amount of &euro;2.54 million. In the restructuring of Enterprise Ireland we are requesting it to focus on the commercialisation of this area. Science Foundation Ireland will also have a strong role to play as part of the wider Government research and development programme. It is the position we will have to be in to maintain economic sustainability. People may not like terms such as &ldquo;going up the value chain&rdquo; or &ldquo;research and development&rdquo;.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies will be aware of global trends and these terms are part of the language at any international gathering. If one examines developed economies versus developing economies, it is clear where Ireland must stand. We must work quickly in upgrading the level of investment in innovation, research and development and so forth. There are 29 IDA Ireland companies in Tallaght employing 3,029 people. Six job creation projects involving foreign direct investment announced this year are located in Dublin. The overall Dublin employment scene is benign. I came from Dundrum this morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Minister on his way to north Kildare?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No. It is estimated that 4,000 people will work at the new shopping complex there when it is completed. A wide range of developments are occurring in different sectors. In the Dublin scene, there will be job gains and losses with opportunities arising. F&Aacute;S has a role in attuning skills sets to these opportunities. Recently at the Dublin north side partnership, I presented FETAC awards to women who went back to F&Aacute;S for training, attaining properly certified skills and gaining employment as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister says is correct but, as Deputy Hogan pointed out, it is all very general. The loss of 200 jobs at APW Tallaght is part of the attrition of jobs from the low and semi-skilled sector in the economy. This is the real issue. Is the Minister aware that a large number of such jobs in the sector are hanging on by their fingertips? How is the Minister actively identifying those vulnerable jobs, some of which will go over the edge this year? How will he put in place a safety net to complete the upskilling of workers? There is a large tranche of companies where wages are a small proportion of profits. There is a larger cohort where wages are slightly larger but it is not as vulnerable. Then there is another cohort, approximately 25% of jobs, where wages are a significant proportion of profits. These need to be identified to ensure the agencies for which the Minister is responsible are active in preventing job losses by upskilling and preparing workers for the transition to this new type of employment he has described. What is the Minister doing to identify this and put in these supports?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the sectors going through significant restructuring in the last two years, not least the agrifood and low cost sectors. However, we, and Enterprise Ireland in particular, are meeting the companies concerned and <Col N="885"/>offering assistance, particularly for value-added goods. The food sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Are there mechanisms in place to identify them? Do they go to the Minister or is it <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We go to them. It is evident what sectors will be in difficulty. Likewise, &euro;27 million extra was allocated to the national training fund for F&Aacute;S in-company training. This will allow it to get ahead of the game before people are made redundant in any restructuring of a company. Traditionally, F&Aacute;S rushed in providing programmes after people were laid off. This will mean a change in mindset from some employers to facilitate this, either in the workplace or in a learning environment, and for employees to take it up.</P>
        <P>I do not have an argument with the Deputy on the core issue. I see Enterprise Ireland as the key agency for indigenous enterprise. Its role is in identifying problems and providing whatever range of supports it can, such as marketing and research, to enable a company to reposition itself and copperfasten its sustainability. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy continues to develop new functions in existing companies and develop a broad portfolio of functions rather than having it depend on one core activity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the mid-west region, except for the Shannon free zone which falls within the remit<?oasys _jy?>of Shannon Development. Shannon Development is also responsible for supporting indigenous enterprises in the mid-west region. The city and county enterprise boards located in the region also help develop indigenous enterprise potential and stimulate economic activity at local level.</P>
        <P>In 2004, Clare County Enterprise Board approved a total of &euro;374,830 in grant assistance to 36 micro-enterprise projects at start-up or expansion stage with an employment potential of 67 jobs throughout the county.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s sectoral emphasis in the mid-west region is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in information communications and technology, international services, medical technologies and life sciences. Between 2001 and 2004, IDA Ireland companies in the mid-west committed to research and development projects worth &euro;37 million.</P><Col N="886"/>
        <P>Last year was a successful one for the mid-west region. Cook Incorporated announced its intention to establish its European shared services centre in Limerick which will add 50 new high quality jobs. Power-One Ireland Limited announced plans to expand its design team and establish its European customer and technical support centre which will create 29 jobs. Organic Lens announced a &euro;6.5 million investment for the development of its manufacturing operations which will create 100 jobs. Monster Cable announced its intention to establish a shared services centre in Ennis which will create 50 jobs.</P>
        <P>There was a net gain in the Shannon free zone of 147 jobs and a significant increase in the number of firms undertaking research and development. Shannon Development is in discussion with a number of organisations with a view to first-time investment in the zone. In addition, Shannon Development is in discussions with its existing portfolio of client companies to secure more of their parent company group activity for Shannon.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development works with existing client companies throughout the remainder of the Shannon region to help develop the competitiveness of indigenous industry clients and to provide the services, infrastructure and support for aspirant high potential start-ups. This is done through the provision of financial supports and through individual programmes such as venture start, WCM programmes, Design Shannon and through the establishment and encouragement of business networks such as Supply Network Shannon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to Shannon Development six times in his statement. With such praise, why has he removed its industrial development function? Employment levels in the Shannon region are at their lowest since 1998. The Minister referred to a number of industries that have set up in the region. However, it was 15 years ago that the last real industrial company, Organic Lens, located in County Clare. The Minister also referred to Monster Cable that set up there three years ago. While it claimed it would employ 50 people, it now only employs ten.</P>
        <P>There is a view in the region that IDA Ireland only concentrates on the gateways and the eastern regions. Analyses in the past have shown a regional imbalance in foreign direct investment. Does the Minister have confidence in Shannon Development given the way he has been speaking about it? He spoke about information technology on which Shannon Development is concentrating, including investment networks and broadband. Is there a regional imbalance and a focus on the gateways and not on the hubs?</P>

        <asker>Mr. Morgan </asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if, in order to prevent exploitation of migrant workers, the Employment Permits Bill which is due for publication, will include provisions to allow permits to be held by workers instead of employers.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6135/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A work permit is granted to an employer in respect of a specified employee and job vacancy, where the employer can demonstrate that the vacancy cannot be filled from within the wider European Economic Area. The EEA comprises the 25 member states of the EU, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.</P>
        <P>Apart from the renewal of existing permits, which now constitute the bulk of applications, <Col N="888"/>new permits are confined to highly skilled and highly paid positions. Current policy is informed by the imperative to address the identified labour and skill needs in the economy. In order to best achieve these ends, the work permit is granted to the employer. This ensures greater traceability, the more effective enforcement of employees&rsquo; rights and enhanced administrative efficiency. In addition, it offers the employee the assurance of a guaranteed work position.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including migrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment, and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>An application for a work permit requires a statement countersigned by the would be employer and employee of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wage legislation. Applications for renewals require documentary proof that the stated wages have been paid.</P>
        <P>Persons employed in Ireland under the work permit scheme in recent years have been readily facilitated in changing jobs. In such circumstances, a new work permit is issued to the person&rsquo;s new employer. This allows an employee to move to a new employer where there are genuine reasons the employee wishes to leave his or her existing employment.</P>
        <P>The proposed Employment Permits Bill, which is currently at the final stages of preparation, will include provision for additional protections for migrant workers. It is intended that employers will be prohibited from deducting from the remuneration of migrant workers any costs associated with their recruitment. Employers will also be prohibited from retaining personal documents belonging to migrant workers.</P>
        <P>Any evidence that particular employers are exploiting their workforce should be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation. The new Bill will also give enabling powers to the Minister, particularly in regard to the question of whether employees can retain their work permits which is under consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very nervous until the last sentence because the Minister held back that crucial piece of information about which I asked, that is, whether the new Bill will give the worker the right to hold the work permit. The Minister said the Bill will contain a provision for regulation whereby the Minister will be able to decide. If the Minister is still in office when this Bill comes into force, will he effect such a regulation? Does he agree what is going on at present <Col N="889"/>is an international shame? Some of the examples were cited earlier in response to Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s priority question where workers are not paid the minimum wage or prearranged wages and are working an excessive number of hours.</P>
        <P>I asked if the Minister had seen the report from the migrant workers&rsquo; centre dealing with a series of cases where foreign women in domestic jobs in middle class homes were working under disgraceful conditions. Does the Minister agree part of the reason foreign workers feel locked into these employments is that their permits are held by employers and not by themselves? The key issue is the Minister&rsquo;s willingness to exercise that regulation so that workers hold the permits which we all agree would enhance workers&rsquo; rights considerably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of whether the employer or the employee should hold the work permit is constantly raised as if it somehow would become a check on any exploitation which might occur. Implicit in that belief is that by holding the work permits, employees would be able to change employment and avoid exploitation.</P>
        <P>At present a work permit is given in respect of particular employment with a particular employer. Experience from the work permits system and the work authorisation scheme suggest the existing system is very easy to administer in so far as it attached to the employer. When allegations of wrongdoing or abuse are made, there is a register in place. If a non-EEA national entering the State on a work permit or under the work authorisation scheme changes employment, will there be a record of employment and so forth in respect of that person? I am disposed to greater freedoms and protections for employees coming here. This legislation will have stronger statutory protections for employees. However, if we move to that system, I want to ensure we do not create a new potential for exploitation and abuse. Currently we have a hold on the employer. If employers engage in unacceptable behaviour and if their behaviour causes difficulties, we can refuse to give them work permits in the future.</P>
        <P>Deputy Joe Higgins raised an issue in the House approximately two weeks ago relating to a specific contract. The company concerned, which was a non-EEA company, won a specific contract from the State and work permits were issued in respect of that contract and no other. No evidence had been brought to the attention of the Department or the labour inspectorate prior to the case being raised in the House. The case is now being followed up and I think the Deputy has supplied some information. We need to be clear that evidence is the key for the labour inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, has direct responsibility for labour and we want to protect workers of all races and creeds. Maltreatment of workers, irrespective of race or creed, is unacceptable.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike Deputy Morgan, I was quite alarmed by the Minister&rsquo;s response. The T&aacute;naiste made a clear declaration to the House when she was in the Minister&rsquo;s Department she would bring in this legislation to effect a transfer of the work permit from the employer to the employee. It is years since that commitment was made but it is still a matter of debate. Does the Minister agree there is an unanswerable case that the work permit should accrue to the individual and not the company so the threat of deportation which is often made &mdash; I have dealt with such cases &mdash; is not available to an employer? It is a simple matter of registration with employment to ensure that the known employer complies with all normal regulations relating to pay etc. At least the right to stay in the country is held by the individual. I want a firm commitment that the information imparted to the House by the T&aacute;naiste is not now being resiled from by her successor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is at the final stage of drafting. I take issue with Deputy Howlin. I am not resiling from anything. To have genuine discussion I like to air issues on the floor of the House as I have just done. The issue is how do we prevent the exploitation of workers, and I made the point that counter-arguments also exist.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Could it be either one of them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the enabling powers will cover a variety of issues, particularly the ongoing economic trends. Inevitably decisions on our work permits system are underpinned by economic criteria. I am in favour of giving greater autonomy to the employee and of the employee having the work permit. However, I need to ensure I do not introduce a system that ultimately might allow the employee to be even further abused.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>On 16 December 2004 in reply to a parliamentary question I announced that I had decided not to proceed with the making of an order under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 to oblige doctors and dentists to display their charges. The reasons were both legal and practical. In particular, as a result of legal advice on the matter I had formed the view that it would not be possible to effectively enforce the display order for doctors and dentists and that making such an order would consequently not be appropriate. In the deliberations on this issue the Department of Health and Children was consulted and informed of the possible contents of an order. That Department had no objections to the making of an order. It supplied my officials with some suggestions as to items to be covered by the order but these did not affect my final decision.</P>
        <P>I cannot see any way around the enforcement problems identified. However, the two professions can introduce measures under their own codes of practice to provide greater price transparency to patients. I did not want to introduce a scheme, as it would result in higher charges for patients.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Two weeks ago a newspaper quoted a Department official as saying the Department had been &ldquo;outfoxed&rdquo;, to use the word contained in an internal memorandum, by the medical and dental professions. The long list of services that would have to be covered became a <i>de facto</i> way of nobbling the idea. The dental profession suggesting that a filling should not be covered was another outfoxing manoeuvre. How does the Minister respond to the publication of the comment from within his Department that it had been outfoxed by the professions?</P>
        <P>Why does the Minister believe it would result in higher charges when the Competition Authority, the Director of Consumer Affairs and many others believe it would be a service to customers and possibly through the introduction of a slightly more competitive environment would lead to a reduction in prices?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="892"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal issues are very real and the most problematic would relate to data protection. We need to consider the practical implications. To check if patients had been charged no more than the price displayed, an inspector would need access to the patient records, which could not be done without the patients&rsquo; consent. Whereas inspectors could seek consent, practical problems would arise. Would inspectors loiter in surgeries&rsquo; waiting rooms and approach patients asking them the procedures they had received and then check the price charged against the display?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister read the IMO submission?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Alternatively would inspectors wait outside surgeries and ask patients to divulge their details? Neither of these scenarios offers a viable basis for enforcing any price display order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should read the IMO submission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of procedures and tests a patient can receive is increasing all the time. There is a generic charge for people seeing a doctor and they have an expectation as to what they will be charged. Some of the lists that emerged did not enthuse me. I am entirely pro-consumer and I am satisfied I took the right decision in the interests of the consumer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This first came to light in response to a parliamentary question I tabled. The T&aacute;naiste announced this with great fanfare more than a year and a half ago and it was to be implemented in weeks. Following a meeting with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, an IMO spokesperson said that Department officials had pointed out logistical problems, which I have now heard rehashed. It is extraordinary that while we can have price lists for hairdressers and others, certain groups are untouchable. We surely can have a mechanism whereby we require the display of prices and while inspection might not take place we could certainly investigate complaints from patients who advise they were charged more than the displayed price. Why can this not be done? Without it we have no basis for real competition in certain sectors. We will have a competitive economy with no-go areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Prices can be displayed in various ways. The use of the Internet is now widespread among businesses and faculties and it would be capable of providing a longer list. Practices have certain basic core services, particularly for a regular visit not involving any procedures. The public display of those charges would not require an inspector hovering over patients in case they were overcharged. It would increase the access to simple basic information. I cannot <Col N="893"/>believe it is beyond the powers of the Department and the relevant professional bodies to agree certain of those simple procedures that nobody could dispute had been carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I would argue to the contrary. It is not as simple as has been suggested. When I saw the file, I decided I could not preside over introducing a scheme that could result in a &euro;200 charge instead of a &euro;50 charge. Deputy Howlin, who was Minister for Health for two and a half years, has as much experience of the concerns we are discussing as I have. The Deputy is laughing in acknowledgement. Can he tell me any scheme that was ever devised where the costs and inputs did not increase?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about transparency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should read my lips on this matter. Having reflected on the matter completely, it is better for the consumer not to go down this road. The legal issues are real in terms of doctor-patient confidentiality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>With cryptic messages between former Ministers for Health it is very difficult for the layman to understand what the Minister is talking about.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>The parties to the Mid-Term Review of Part Two of Sustaining Progress &mdash; Pay and the Workplace agreed to request the Labour Court to review the national minimum wage and to make a recommendation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, to apply with effect from 1 May 2005. In accordance with this commitment, the Labour Court has undertaken a review of the national minimum wage. Arising from this review, on 1 February 2005 the Labour Court recommended that the minimum wage be increased to &euro;7.65 with effect from 1 May 2005. The national minimum wage legislation, allows a three-month period for my consideration of the Labour Court recommendation.</P><Col N="894"/>
        <P>The Labour Court did not recommend any changes to the structure of the sub-minimum rates of the minimum wage nor is any currently proposed. However, any changes to the minimum wage, which may arise from this current review, would also impact on the sub-minimum rates as these are expressed in legislation as percentage rates of the national minimum wage. Therefore, if an increase to the minimum wage should become effective from 1 May, the sub-minimum rates would increase from that date also.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree it would be more appropriate to adjust sub-minimum rates of pay in the context of national pay talks than to continue to require people to bring cases to the Labour Court? We need to ensure this country remains competitive, for example by ensuring that people receive appropriate levels of pay. Such issues should be resolved during the new pay round. Does the Minister of State agree it would be more appropriate to approach the matter in that context, rather then involving the machinery of the Labour Court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Minister of State about the minimum wage, which is the subject of Question No. 80. It was recently disclosed that some people working on the Dublin Port tunnel are being paid just half the minimum wage. Some 40 workers, who are involved in dangerous work on the tunnel, which is a major project, are being paid just &euro;7 or &euro;8 per hour. I have great concerns in that regard, especially as other workers involved in the same project are being paid twice that amount. Is the Minister of State aware of this problem? Will he do something about it?</P>

	<P>Deputy Howlin is correct. We have dealt with the issue raised by Deputy Finian McGrath in considerable detail already. I remind Deputy Hogan that the national minimum wage is set under the terms of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. I do not propose to introduce legislation to change its existing legislative basis. I intend to ask the ESRI to conduct an assessment of the effect the current proposal would have on competitiveness.</P>

        <P>I am aware of the recent job losses which have been announced. In such circumstances, my immediate concern is for workers who have lost their jobs or will lose them soon. The full services of F&Aacute;S are available to the workers at the earliest opportunity if they wish to avail of them. Services which are likely to be availed of relate to retraining and upskilling, which are of particular assistance when re-entering the workplace.</P>
        <P>The job losses at Schering Plough will initially take place on a voluntary basis over a 12-month period. A similar reduction in numbers that was announced in December 2003 was achieved through voluntary redundancy and the ending of temporary contracts.</P>
        <P>SerCom has decided to cease its production activities in Dublin to ensure it continues to provide the highest level of service to its customers in a profitable manner and protects the future <Col N="896"/>viability of the business. It proposes to concentrate on its Limerick facility, in which 300 people are already employed. Some 32 jobs will be retained in Dublin to provide support services.</P>
        <P>The decision by Jefferson Smurfit to close its operation in Dublin follows a detailed review of its paper mill operation, which has become uncompetitive. The Clonskeagh operation was the last paper manufacturing plant in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The board of Greencore has made a commercial decision to cease the production of sugar beet in Carlow. The sole production facility in Ireland will be retained in Mallow. The full implications of the company&rsquo;s decision are being assessed by the development agencies.</P>
        <P>Direct employment in companies in Cork supported by IDA Ireland continues to grow. Information and communications technologies, medical technologies and international services are the main sectors which are contributing to that growth. Projects approved in the last four years created up to 5,000 jobs. A number of developments in Cork will provide significant employment opportunities, such as Aer Rianta&rsquo;s investment at Cork Airport and the construction of a flyover at the Kinsale Road roundabout.</P>
        <P>Wyeth Biopharma employs approximately 700 people at Clondalkin in Dublin, a figure that is expected to rise to 1,300 by the end of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was wondering what job creation in Cork had to do with job losses in Clondalkin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to Cork because Question No. 65 relates to job losses at Schering Plough near Bandon.</P>
        <P>A Japanese pharmaceuticals company, Takeda Chemical Industries, has also begun construction in Clondalkin and will employ 50 people. A number of projects at Citywest are providing locally accessible employment opportunities for people in Clondalkin.</P>
        <P>The existing base of overseas companies in Carlow consists of five firms, which employ almost 1,000 people. In addition, IDA Ireland has committed investment of &euro;11.5 million to the development of Carlow business and technology park. Enterprise Ireland and the Carlow county enterprise board are similarly committed to the development of industry in Carlow.</P>
        <P>Job losses and gains have always been and will continue to be part of the economic landscape. It is important to stress that Ireland&rsquo;s unemployment rate is among the lowest in Europe. The industrial development agencies are undertaking investment promotion activities to generate new flows of foreign direct investment into Ireland, while developing the indigenous industrial base. They are working to identify and support new investment opportunities from existing client bases. Ireland needs to maximise investment from growth sectors such as the medical devices sector. It is also important to maintain and improve the competitiveness of companies and to enhance their capacity for investment and employment <Col N="897"/>creation. I am satisfied that the combined effort of the industrial development agencies, along with the involvement of local business and community interests, will be sufficient to address the job needs of the country in general.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss this important matter on the Adjournment. All Deputies are aware of Ireland&rsquo;s horrific number of road deaths, which take place on a daily basis. This country&rsquo;s road accident figures are high by European standards. The annual number of road fatalities is unacceptably high. We need to ensure that the number decreases. We have been cautioned to slow down, not to speed and not to drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol. I would like to discuss road conditions, a factor other than driver error that plays an important part in many road accidents. We are under-estimating the important part played by road conditions in the causation of road accidents.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>I had the unfortunate experience of attending at a fatal road traffic accident at Murrevaugh, just outside Mulranny, on 22 December last. A young girl aged 22 was killed during daylight hours on a stretch of road which has been the site of a number of accidents in recent times, according to people who live in the area. I understand that a young man I treated that day wrote off his car on the same stretch of road just before the fatal accident to which I refer took place. I understand that since then, a further young man has had a similar accident on the stretch of road.</P>
        <P>I do not want to prejudice the result of an ongoing investigation into the fatal accident that took place on 22 December. I offer my profound sympathy to the parents and the rest of the family of the deceased girl. Her father, who has a significant knowledge of roads because he works full-time in the road construction industry, has questioned the quality of the surface of the road at the location where the accident took place. He maintains that the road&rsquo;s surface of dense bitumen macadam, DBM, base course, the laying down of which was completed on 4 October 2004, is not suitable for the speed limit of 100 km/h that was in place when the accident took place at the relevant stretch of road, which is outside the 50 km/h zone.</P>
        <P>When I contacted the National Roads Authority about this matter, I was informed that the surface of the road in question should have had a permanent surface dressing, but that had not been applied. The NRA&rsquo;s manual HD 36/99, which outlines the surfacing material to be used on roads and bridges, recommends that DBM wearing course without surface dressing should not be permitted as a permanent surface on high-speed roads. It goes on to state that DBM base course should be surface dressed within three weeks, or as soon as practicable.</P>
        <P>The NRA guidelines state that a DBM road that has not been surface dressed should be subject to speed restrictions of 50 km/h and signs should be erected indicating clearly that the road surface is temporary. I have written to Mayo County Council to suggest that 50 km/h speed limit signs be erected at Murrevaugh, in line with the recommendations of the NRA, but that has not yet been done. It is to be welcomed that other types of sign can be seen, but signs stating that it is a 50 km/h zone and that the road surface is temporary need to be put in place.</P>
        <P>Two lorries were recently involved in separate accidents on a stretch of road in County Galway known as the Curragh line. I understand the road surface, which is in a 100 km/h zone, is DBM without a surface dressing. A 50 km/h speed limit has been imposed in the area and signs stating that the road surface is temporary have been erected.</P>
        <P>I was not previously aware of this problem. I am anxious that the Minister for Transport should examine all cases of this nature and investigate the problems associated with this type of <Col N="899"/>road surface. He should ensure that the guidelines and recommendations of the NRA are followed in the interests of driver safety. How many other roads have a surface that is not in line with the recommendations of the NRA, which is the funding body for roads projects? I do not want to say who is at fault but it is important to note that road conditions continue to play a more significant part in road traffic accidents than we realise. We can do something about it. We have had too many road traffic accidents and they have led to unnecessary loss of life. It is time that they were prevented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter. Although the question with which I was provided differs slightly from that which the Deputy raised, I support his view on the need for participation by all in improved road safety to ensure success. I sympathise with the family of the young girl who was killed tragically last December, as referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I was interested to note Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s remarks on the girl&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s knowledge of road surfacing. I ask the Deputy to relay his information in this regard to my office for investigation. I would like to have the matter fully investigated. As the Deputy implied, nobody in the House wants to point fingers or apportion blame. If there are ambiguities regarding who is responsible for this area, we should ensure that they are fully and properly addressed.</P>
        <P>The information provided to me states clearly that the causes of road accidents are many and varied. I understand that road conditions can comprise, on occasion, a causal or contributory factor. A National Roads Authority analysis of factors contributing to fatal and injurious accidents in 2002 indicates that the behaviour of drivers and pedestrians are the key contributory factors, in 86% and 9.7% of cases, respectively, whereas road factors were identified as contributory factors in only 2.5% of fatal and seriously injurious accidents.</P>
        <P>The position on the carrying out of pavement improvement works and resurfacing on national roads is that the planning, design and implementation of such works are a matter for the relevant local authority in accordance with the requirements of the NRA. The requirements and standards regarding pavement improvement works, resurfacing and the signage of such works are set out in the NRA specification for road works and two circular letters issued by the NRA in March 2002 and May 2002. The timely completion of road improvement works is a matter for the local authority concerned and, as part of its overall supervision of the national roads programme, the NRA.</P>
        <P>The issues raised by the Deputy have been noted and will be taken up with the NRA for consideration in the context of any revised and further guidance to local authorities on the imple<Col N="900"/>mentation of pavement improvement and resurfacing works on national roads that they may consider necessary.</P>
        <P>A note prepared by my Department refers to the road works at Murrevaugh on the N58. It states that it is understood that white bitumen tarmac was laid in October 2004 and that, because of the prevailing temperature at the time, it was not possible to complete the road improvement works by surface dressing, which would normally be needed to complete the work. As a consequence, it is understood that while the NRA required that surface dressing be applied as soon as practicable, the road section has been left without final resurfacing from October last. Therefore, it is important that signage and markings indicate to road users that work is still under way on the section of the road being improved. The note prepared by the Department also states that it is understood, given the concerns raised about the road pavement condition at Murrevaugh, that Mayo County Council, rather than waiting until May for suitable conditions to apply surface dressing, will now change the pavement construction to include a hot rolled asphalt wearing course which will be applied in the coming weeks. The note from the Department does not clarify what signage is in place but I assure the House that I will take the matter up with the Department to ensure that it is appropriate.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for attending to respond to it. I bring to the attention of the House an increasing problem associated with petrol-propelled scooters which are popular with many young people. Will the Minister of State clarify whether children and young people under 16 are legally entitled to drive them? Will he state whether it is legal for a person under 16 to purchase petrol from a garage?</P>
        <P>In preparing for this Adjournment debate, I carried out a small survey of petrol stations to determine whether they had any policy on selling petrol to people under 16. Few petrol stations had notices stating children under 16 should not access petrol from their petrol pumps. However, I understand from anecdotal comments that young people are buying petrol from petrol stations and garages to power their scooters. We need national guidelines to inform petrol station owners and their staff of the law.</P>
        <P>Four years ago, we began to see many young people using the two-wheeled motor-propelled scooter. Over the past 12 months, there has been an increase in the number of mini-motorbikes with high-powered engines. There are also mini-quad bikes which can reach quite high speeds. The mini-scooters are popular with young people under 16 who do not receive any training on how to operate them. They do not have driving licences nor are they insured. Children, because <Col N="901"/>of their low body weights, can reach quite high speeds on such motorised scooters, especially the newer, more sophisticated versions.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, one young person was killed recently on a mini-scooter in Belfast. This was a tragedy waiting to happen. There have been a number of accidents and serious incidents but it is only a matter of time until more young people are killed or seriously injured.</P>
        <P>This is the second time in a week that I have raised an issue concerning young people and new technology. Last week, I raised the issue of mobile phone ringtones and I have had a great response from many people, parents in particular, who share my concerns. The lack of a regulatory framework regarding the sale and use of mini-scooters and mini-motorbikes is similar to the lack of such a framework in the mobile telephony sector. They are a new technology and are instantly popular with young people, which is quite understandable. However, regulatory frameworks and parents often lag far behind in addressing the possible child safety issues associated with technology. I often see and hear young people using mini-scooters and motorbikes in estates of my Dublin South-Central constituency. I am sure the repeated sound of their lawnmower-type engines is familiar to everybody in the House.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the regulated use of mini-scooters and mini-motorbikes. However, they should be supervised and off the public roads. There is a real child safety issue associated with their use by people under 16 on the public roads. The Garda appears to have adopted something of a hands-off policy. I can understand the reasons for its reluctance to take action against young people but we need to have regard to the safety of children and others on our roads. I am particularly concerned about elderly pedestrians, for example.</P>
        <P>We need to address the sale and distribution of mini-scooters and mini-motorbikes. There are obligations on the distributors and retail outlet staff in this regard. What do they tell their customers? Do they sell directly to people under 16? After addressing the sale and distribution of mini-scooters, we need to address their use. To what guidelines is the Garda operating? Is it illegal for a person under 16 to use these vehicles on public roads? Can we offer safer, off-road sites where mini-scooters and mini-motorbikes can be used?</P>
        <P>Finally, we must address the sale and distribution of petrol. Is it illegal to sell or supply petrol to a person under 16? If so, do the garages&rsquo; staff know of the relevant stipulation? I would like to see the law in this area enforced and effective public notice given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this issue. I welcome the opportunity afforded to me to re-emphasise the risks and possible offences associated with the use by children of motorised mini-scooters and other small types of <Col N="902"/>motor propelled vehicles. The Government&rsquo;s concern over protecting young people from the improper use of motor vehicles predates this debate. The Road Traffic Act 2004, which was enacted before Christmas, makes it an offence to supply a mechanically propelled vehicle to a person under 16 years of age. With effect from 24 January 2005, a person convicted of supplying a vehicle to a minor faces a fine of up to &euro;3,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to six months or both.</P>
        <P>It is important that it be widely known that mini-motorised scooters, micro-motorcycles and quadricycles come within the definition of a mechanically propelled vehicle for road traffic law purposes and that supply includes giving a gift. As a result, it is illegal to supply such a vehicle to a person under 16 years of age. A range of requirements must be satisfied for both the vehicle and the driver to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. When in use in a public place a vehicle must comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>These regulations prescribe the requirements for essential matters such as brakes, steering, mirrors, safety glass, wipers, headlamps, rear lighting, indicators, reflectors etc. Some of these small vehicles do not comply with one or more of these requirements and are, therefore, not suitable for use in a public place irrespective of the age of the driver.</P>
        <P>A driving licence is required to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. A person under 16 years may not hold a driving licence or a provisional licence. The minimum age for a driving licence for vehicles of category M, which covers mopeds and small motorcycles, is 16 years while for a category B licence, which includes quadricycles, the minimum age is 17 years.</P>
        <P>It is a further requirement of road traffic law that to use a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place the driver has third party insurance cover to meet personal injury and property damage caused by negligent driving. The penalties for breaches of the road traffic law in respect of these requirements are a fine not exceeding &euro;800 in the case of a first offence, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 in the case of a second or subsequent offence and a fine of &euro;1,500 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both, in the case of a third or subsequent offence in a period of 12 consecutive months.</P>
        <P>A person convicted of driving without insurance incurs five penalty points on his or her driving licence. Enforcement of the road traffic law is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition to the requirements of road traffic law, a mechanically propelled vehicle for use in a public place is required to be registered and liable to motor tax, which are matters for the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for the Envir<Col N="903"/>onment, Heritage and Local Government, respectively.</P>
        <P>Road traffic law does not extend to the use of mechanically propelled vehicles in private property. It is, therefore, outside my remit to regulate or control the use of mechanically propelled vehicles in private property. There is, therefore, a wider dimension to this issue which has to be addressed by parents and guardians of children. I expect parents and guardians to act responsibly and with due diligence in the use of small mechanically propelled vehicles by children under their care.</P>
        <P>The use of mini-motorcycles, scooters and quadricycles has increased substantially in recent years. They can be used on public or private roads. In an area which I visit farmers use quadricycles where heretofore they might have used a horse or tractor to cover rough terrain.</P>
        <P>A quadricycle may be used mostly on private property except to cross a public road in travelling around that property. The law is quite clear on this, if the quadricycle is driven on private property that is a matter for the landowner. On public property, however, the issues I have outlined prevail, namely, the requirement to adhere to the various regulations in place.</P>
        <P>I allowed my children to use these vehicles but had to ensure that they did so on private property. I concur with the Deputy&rsquo;s view on the potential for serious injury, particularly in light of the recent accident involving one. There is a wider dimension to this issue which parents and guardians must address. I will be happy to discuss this with the Deputy at some other time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised on several occasions in this House the murders of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan in Grangegorman in March 1997. The murders shocked the country and caused great anxiety and concern in the area of Dublin where they occurred. They were probably the most horrific and brutal murders of recent times.</P>
        <P>It would be difficult to imagine two more vulnerable victims than these two unfortunate women living in sheltered health board accommodation in Grangegorman. If for no other reason than the extreme callousness of the murder of these two innocent people, this case should be brought to finality, the person or persons responsible prosecuted and justice seen to be done.</P>
        <P>For that reason and because I am one of the local Deputies for the area I feel I must support the plea made on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme this morning when Stella Nolan, the sister of Sylvia Shiels, one of the victims, requested a full explanation and-or an independent inquiry into the Garda handling of this case. There have been at least two major issues involved, one being the miscarriage of justice involving the late Dean Lyons, the person first charged with the murders. <Col N="904"/>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today issued a full apology and cleared his name, and his parents have accepted that apology. For them this has brought finality to the tragedy. Out of respect for their feelings, I will say nothing further about that aspect of the case.</P>
        <P>The sister of one of the victims is at the very least entitled to a comprehensive explanation as to why no one was subsequently charged with the two murders. Stella Nolan pointed out that investigative journalists have written a great deal about this case but the Garda told her that information is not correct. That seems to be all the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will say.</P>
        <P>Jim Cusack, in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>in September 2000, quoted in great detail apparently from a statement made by Mark Nash, the second person to admit to the murders. Nash described in precise detail the knife used and the pattern on the sole of his boots, a footprint of which the garda&iacute; are said to have from the crime scene. Jim Cusack went on to quote Nash giving further details of the crime scene which apparently were known only to the investigating garda&iacute; and the killer.</P>
        <P>Why was Nash not charged with the crime at that point? He later withdrew his confession. The very least that can be said is that the Garda made an appalling mess of the investigation of this terrible crime. I am aware of the internal Garda inquiry into the case but regrettably this has not been made public.</P>
        <P>We do not know the extent of the Garda mismanagement of the case or whether procedures have been put in place to prevent the same thing happening again. Stella Nolan states that the Garda have told her only that their investigation is ongoing. Is it any wonder that she describes it as an ongoing investigation going nowhere? The buck stops with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. If charges cannot be brought against the main suspect, surely the reasons for this should be fully outlined to the immediate relatives of the victims. Not doing so gives the impression that the Garda has something to hide and adds to the distress and sense of loss of the relatives.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a comprehensive explanation, Stella Nolan is fully justified in seeking an independent inquiry. The Minister must take steps to redress this problem. This case should not be left ongoing or swept under the carpet. I pay tribute to Stella Nolan, who, like the sisters of Robert McCartney, demands that justice be seen to be done. In both circumstances the families deserve to see justice done. This is a matter of significant public concern to warrant an inquiry under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Gregory for raising this issue and convey the regrets of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to be here for this debate because he is abroad on public business.</P><Col N="905"/>
        <P>The murders of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan on the nights of 6 and 7 March 1997 as they lay asleep in their beds were particularly brutal and merciless and provoked universal revulsion. I was aware of the murders because I was involved in the then Eastern Health Board and expressed my revulsion at the time in that forum.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today issued a public apology to the family of the late Dean Lyons, exonerating him of any wrongdoing in connection with the horrific murders of Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan. The Minister and I can only hope that this sincere apology will assist to bring closure on the matter to the Lyons family. I am happy to note from what I hear in the media that the Lyons family is satisfied with the Garda apology.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has outlined the facts of the case to Deputy Gregory on a number of occasions. However, once again, the relevant facts as notified to me by the Garda authorities are as follows. Ms Sylvia Shiels and Ms Mary Callinan were brutally murdered at Grangegorman in March 1997. In July of the same year, the late Mr. Dean Lyons made a full confession to investigating Garda officers of his alleged guilt in the double murder. This confession was recorded on audio-visual tape. Later the same day, he made a further detailed admission of his alleged involvement in the murders. This second interview was not audio-visually recorded at Mr. Lyons&rsquo;s request.</P>
        <P>Following consultation between the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the person in question was charged with one of the murders at Grangegorman. In August 1997, another person, who had been arrested and detained during the investigation of another double murder in County Roscommon, made a confession in regard to the Grangegorman murders. That person later retracted the admissions. As a result of the admissions made by the second person, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to review all available evidence in regard to these murders. The Garda authorities have stated that the investigation indicated that Mr. Lyons did not commit the murders in question. It also concluded that the manner in which Mr. Lyons had been interviewed in regard to the case was in compliance with the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997 which came into effect on 1 March 1997.</P>
        <P>Following completion of this inquiry, a report was submitted by the Assistant Commissioner to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In April 1998, after consideration of the report, the DPP decided that criminal proceedings against Mr. Lyons be discontinued. In July 1999, Mr. Lyons presented a signed and witnessed statement denying any involvement in the Grangegorman murders. Having considered the file submitted to him by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to the second <Col N="906"/>individual who had confessed to the murders, the DPP decided that no prosecution should take place.</P>
        <P>When the DPP decides not to prosecute in a particular case, the reasons for the decision are given to the State solicitor and the investigating garda&iacute;. The director has stated that it is policy not to disclose this information otherwise. The policy has been upheld by the Supreme Court. As the House is aware, the function in regard to the prosecution of alleged offences is the responsibility of the DPP who is independent in the exercise of his functions. It would, therefore, not be appropriate for the Minister or me to intervene or comment on his decisions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, solicitors representing the sister of one of the murder victims, Ms Sylvia Shiels, has asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there be a fully independent public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Ms Shiels&rsquo;s death and grounds this request on the protections afforded by the European Convention on Human Rights. The Minister has previously outlined to this House that, following consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Attorney General, he is not satisfied of the potential effectiveness of a full public tribunal of inquiry. However, in view of the matters raised by the solicitors involved and to assist the Minister in his consideration of the request, he has asked the solicitors to outline in further detail the reasons they consider a public inquiry to be necessary. A full response has not yet been received by him. I invite Deputy Gregory to make a similar submission to the Minister if he so wishes.</P>
        <P>The criminal investigation into these two brutal murders is ongoing and the release of any report on the conduct of the investigation into the public domain would be inappropriate at this stage. I hope this is somewhat helpful to Deputy Gregory, particularly in light of the fresh information I have given to the House this afternoon.</P>

      <sTitle>School Staffing.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the matter of the additional teaching staff required for Urlingford national school, County Kilkenny. Urlingford national school has ten teachers, including an administrative principal, a shared learning support teacher and a full-time resource teacher. At the moment the school has seven class teachers for 196 children and eight streams, giving an average of exactly 28 children per class. However, due to the necessity to divide a class and to minimise disruption in the school, there are two mixed classes &mdash; second and third class &mdash; with 34 children and a third and fourth class with 35 children. These are real figures that belie the pupil-teacher ratio figures we regularly hear about from the Minister for Education and Science. Technically, the pupil-teacher ratio of the school could be <Col N="907"/>reckoned at 19.6:1 but the reality is much different.</P>
        <P>The parents have been in contact with all public representatives in the area to highlight this matter. The current staffing numbers mean that a school the size of Urlingford national school would need another 13 children to gain another class teacher. In light of recent announcements by the Minister for Finance in the Book of Estimates, I hope the Minister for Education and Science will give priority to dealing with this difficulty which is caused by the fact that the particular class is to be divided. The Minister will understand that lower class sizes can only be achieved in a particular way in this school.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister take account of the particular difficulties in Urlingford national school, which have been reflected in correspondence to the Department by the parents&rsquo; council? I believe that public representatives generally would appeal to the Minister for Education and Science to resolve the school&rsquo;s dilemma in providing the best possible education to the children of Urlingford national school.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Hogan for raising this matter and will relay to the Minister the position he put forcefully. I thank him for this opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science concerning staffing in primary schools, including Urlingford national school.</P>
        <P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department of Education and Science to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year.</P><Col N="908"/>
        <P>Urlingford national school had an enrolment on 30 September 2003 of 196 pupils which warranted staffing for the 2004-05 school year of a principal and seven mainstream teachers. The school also has the service of a resource teacher and a shared learning support teacher. According to data submitted to the Department of Education and Science by the board of management, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 2004 was 197 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule which is expected to be notified to boards of management in March 2005.</P>
        <P>Urlingford national school is included in the rural dimension of Giving Children an Even Break. The school benefits from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The Department has engaged in an overall review of its educational disadvantage programmes with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. Any decision to expand or extend any of the initiatives aimed at addressing educational disadvantage is being considered in the context of this review, the outcome of which my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, hopes to announce shortly.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the special education section of the Department has no outstanding applications for special needs resources from the school in question. However, if any applications for special needs resources are received, they will be considered in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s criteria.</P>
        <P>I hope that is somewhat helpful. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, to keep Deputy Hogan informed of progress in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I visited the 3GSM World Congress and Exhibition in Cannes on 15 February last to support the strong Irish delegation of 19 companies which attended it. Fourteen of the Irish companies availed of the Irish stand at the exhibition, organised by Enterprise Ireland, while five companies had their own stands.</P>
        <P>The 3GSM World Congress and Exhibition is the premier world show for the wireless telecoms industry. The organisers this year registered over 40,000 participants from over 170 countries, including all of the major operators and equipment manufacturers active in the 3G wireless sector.</P>
        <P>Each of the Irish companies attending had an individual programme of meetings with operators and systems integrators.</P>
        <P>I attended a networking dinner, organised by Enterprise Ireland, for the Irish companies and their partners on the evening of 15 February. The attendees at this dinner were drawn equally from Irish companies and the international investors, buyers and operating companies represented at the exhibition, some of them brought specially for this event by Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>I was pleased to have been able to meet each of the Irish companies participating in the exhibition to express my support for their activities. I also met representatives of NTT DoCoMo, NEC and Siemens&rsquo; venture capital arm, SMA, to encourage them to improve their co-operation with Irish companies.</P>
        <P>I was deeply impressed by both the exhibition and by the Irish companies which participated in it. The companies have a clear commercial focus and excited a substantial level of interest among systems integrators, buyers and operators attending the exhibition. The wireless telecoms market was valued at over $380 billion in 2003, and is expected to grow to over 500 billion dollars in five years time. I believe Ireland has a clear strength in this sector and that many of the companies participating in this exhibition will show substantial growth over the coming years.</P><Col N="910"/>
        <P>Although it is still too soon after the exhibition to detail specific commercial outcomes, the feedback from the companies attending is positive. The Government, through Enterprise Ireland, will be following up with both the Irish companies and the international buyers at the show to ensure that the opportunities identified are availed of.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 43 and 74 together.</P>
        <P>Section 21 of the 1990 Act, as amended, prohibits the disclosure of information obtained under section 19 investigations except to certain specified &ldquo;competent authorities&rdquo; and for certain purposes. Accordingly, I am not in a position to disclose any details or findings of the investigations to date.</P>
        <P>Information and assistance has been provided to both the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals by the authorised officer and by my Department at various dates in the period since March 2004 and this is continuing.</P>
        <P>The progress of these investigations was monitored by my predecessor and by the Department over the course of the past seven years. It was the expectation that the investigations would be concluded within a reasonable period following the coming into operation of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. Over time, concerns developed on the part of the T&aacute;naiste and the Department in relation to the timeframe of the investigations and these were conveyed at various times to the authorised officer. These concerns <Col N="911"/>culminated in the issue of a formal direction on 29 July 2004 to the authorised officer to cease investigative work and to commence writing up the reports with a view to facilitating appropriate follow-up action as soon as possible by relevant authorities. I am informed and understand that this direction was based solely on concerns relating to the length of time which the investigations were taking and to the consequential possibility that any meaningful substantive follow-up action, if such were deemed necessary, would be rendered more difficult.</P>

        <P>The proposed new legislation, which was recommended by the 2004 Forf&aacute;s review, will provide for the introduction of new controls on arms brokering and on the provision of certain types of technical assistance. Existing legislation will be also updated to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for increased penalties for non-compliance with export control legislation, for the statutory right for the inspection and audit, by officials from my Department, of companies that export military goods and for controls on the transfer of relevant software and technology by electronic means. Work on drafting of the new legislation has commenced and it is hoped to publish the Bill this year.</P>
        <P>The introduction of this new legislation will ensure that Ireland meets its EU and international obligations in full and equally ensures that its procedures are not overly restrictive as to make Ireland an unattractive location by international standards for mobile activity in legitimate industries.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 47 together.</P>
        <P>The report referred to is the Review of Enterprise Ireland Supported High Potential Start-ups 1989-2004, conducted by Enterprise Ireland. I should point out that the report is an internal report of Enterprise Ireland and as such is an operational issue for the agency and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has informed me that the report is a review of the performance of 470 Enterprise Ireland supported high potential start-up companies, HPSUs, that started between 1989 and June 2004.</P>
        <P>Of the 470 HPSUs that started in this period, 357, or 76% of firms are still trading as EI clients, 21, or 4%, were taken over and 92, or 20%, are closed. Enterprise Ireland considers that the failure rate is low by most standards given the normal risk of starting a new business.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the average number of start-ups per year has also increased significantly between 1989 and 2004. It has risen from an average of 17 new HPSUs per year in the 1989 to 1996 period to an average of 58 HPSUs per year in the period 2001 to 2003. During 2004, 65 new HPSUs were started and supported and I will be announcing the names of these companies on 2 March 2005. The review also found that there has been no appreciable increase in the failure rates, despite the substantial increase in the volume of start-ups.</P>
        <P>The economic importance of HPSUs is not underestimated by Enterprise Ireland. In 2003, the 357 companies still trading as EI clients had a combined direct employment of 7,458 people &mdash; the majority of which were highly skilled jobs &mdash; and total sales of &euro;979 million. This represents a very substantial positive economic impact.</P>
        <P>EI will not be complacent and will seek to further increase the success rate of HPSUs. Of the 52% of HPSUs that fail, this failure occurs within the first three years. This &ldquo;valley of death&rdquo; period has been highlighted as an area where EI is to devote more resources and effort including: a team based approach to bring the extensive experience and a range of expertise to bear at this critical stage; a joint approach by EI staff in Ireland and overseas to assist early stage companies to identify and secure key customer reference sites; a more direct and supportive approach to assisting companies to develop and augment their management team and board capabilities; and a milestone funding based approach to the provision of EI funding to an increased number of <Col N="913"/>the start-ups phasing funding in line with realistic targets.</P>

	<P>A Bill to put Ireland&rsquo;s existing employment permit system on a statutory basis is in the final stage of drafting. The intention is to have the Bill enacted before the summer recess. The preparatory stages of this Bill have taken longer than expected because of the change in labour market circumstances, due to the enlargement of the European Union.</P>
        <P>The proposed Employment Permits Bill 2005, which will govern the issue of all employment permits for nationals from outside the European economic area, EEA, will put the existing employment permit administrative arrangements on a sound legislative footing and thereby provide greater accountability and transparency. The EEA comprises the 25 EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.</P>
        <P>It is also intended that the Bill will include provisions that will empower me to issue employment permits of extended or indefinite duration, analogous to a &ldquo;green card&rdquo; type system, where the workers in question are critical to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s skill and employment needs.</P>

	<P>The implementation of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional development strategy is a day-to-day matter for the agency and not one in which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland informs me that it seeks to encourage a balanced spread of regional enterprise development in line with Government policy. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy in this regard includes encouraging companies, where relevant, <Col N="914"/>to locate outside Dublin and its environs to less developed regions.</P>
        <P>One of the ways in which Enterprise Ireland encourages client companies that wish to relocate to regional locations is by making it financially more attractive for them to establish or grow outside Dublin and the mid-east. Enterprise Ireland provides higher levels of funding assistance for companies that are expanding or establishing a business in certain regions.</P>
        <P>The availability of suitable building infrastructure can be an important factor in encouraging companies to expand outside Dublin and Enterprise Ireland makes its client companies aware of available business space in the regions. It also conducts itineraries to regional locations for companies which might be encouraged to relocate. Furthermore, Enterprise Ireland is directly involved in supporting certain programmes aimed at building infrastructure for businesses.</P>
        <P>There is little tradition of companies relocating outside of Dublin. While Enterprise Ireland can encourage a company to consider relocation, it is the company itself that makes the final decision. There are many factors, beyond the influence of Enterprise Ireland, which the company will consider such as its home base, proximity to markets, availability of physical, educational and research infrastructure, access to raw materials and availability of skilled labour and research facilities, to name but a few.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland remains committed to the creation of an environment where existing businesses in the regions can develop their competitiveness, high growth start-up businesses are encouraged, and innovation flourishes. My Department considers the issue as a priority and has recently asked Enterprise Ireland to review its regional enterprise development strategy. It is intended that this review will facilitate the design of a new regional strategy for the agency.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the report referred to in the question has been brought to my attention.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, <Col N="915"/>including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers.</P>
        <P>In the area of pay and conditions, it is primarily the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 that apply to employees who are employed in domestic service.</P>
        <P>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure on behalf of the employer to maintain adequate records is an offence.</P>
        <P>It should be noted also that in many cases employment rights legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the labour inspectorate, take the matter before a commissioner in the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>Where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires a statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is evidence of the intent to comply with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; P60 and other sources are used. New work permits are not granted for sectors such as domestic employment where it is believed that such employment can be met from the Irish-EEA labour market and where there is a greater risk of exploitation; the granting of new work permits for this category of worker ceased in early 2004.</P>

The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, under the aegis of the Minister for Finance now holds responsibility for practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance.</P>
        <P>My Department is not considering bringing forward proposals for the establishment of a State insurance company. Financial services generally are a matter for the Minister for Finance. I am not aware of any plans in this regard. I understand, however, that State funding of an insurance company would raise state aid issues under EU rules.</P>

A number of these directives have been transposed but are still the subject of legal proceedings by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>In relation to six of the directives that have not yet been transposed and for which the deadline has passed, letters of formal notice have recently being received from the Commission.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that my Department is giving all due priority to the task of implementing EU directives, in light of the available resources.</P>

	<P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. However, for situations where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and where the internal procedures normally used by the parties have failed to resolve a dispute, the parties may avail of procedures set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and supported by the enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. These procedures contain two distinct strands for settling the issues in dispute &mdash; a voluntary procedure and a fall-back legislative procedure. I have no plans to bring forward new legislation in this area.</P>

	<P>Membership of the review group on the functions of the employment rights bodies consisted of representatives of the bodies covered by the review and representatives of the Department <Col N="918"/>of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Written submissions were received from various parties, including the social partners and the bodies covered by the review.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The review group made a number of recommendations intended to bring a greater coherence to the workings of the bodies, combined with greater accessibility and improved customer service. These included improved internal processes and common procedures, some possible reconfiguration of fora and measures to bring about legislative restatement and harmonisation of the large corpus of employment rights legislation.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>Since receiving the report my Department and I have engaged in a very intensive process of consultations in the context of the report. The key challenge to be faced in formulating the Government&rsquo;s proposals in this area will be to offer a better customer service while reforming procedures and simplifying the overall process, but while not reducing employment rights or undermining the adjudicative independence of the various bodies concerned.</P>
        <P>The very intensive consultations to which I have already referred have identified a number of possible approaches that can command a wide degree of consensus among the various interests involved.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 61, 66 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual/s concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees and these records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure on behalf of the employer to maintain adequate records is an offence.</P>
        <P>I urge anyone who has specific evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the Inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.</P>
        <P>The wages and employment conditions of workers employed in the construction industry are governed by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order, which is enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department. In this regard, the rate of pay <Col N="920"/>which can be enforced in respect of construction operatives under the terms of the registered employment agreement is &euro;7.36 per hour.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the provisions of a registered employment agreement may also be effected under the industrial relations Acts. A trade union, an association of employers or an individual employer may complain to the Labour Court that a particular employer is not complying with a registered employment agreement. If, after investigating a complaint, the court is satisfied that the employer is in breach of a registered employment agreement it may by order direct compliance with the agreement. Failure to comply with such an order is an offence punishable by a fine.</P>
        <P>Where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is evidence of intention to comply with minimum wages legislation. Applications for work permit renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; form P60 and other sources are used for this.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 41, 50 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>Between 17 and 25 January 2005, I accompanied the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie <Col N="921"/>Ahern, on an official visit and trade mission to China. The Ministers for Education and Science, Agriculture and Food and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources also participated.</P>
        <P>The trade mission was the largest in the history of the State, involving in total 121 Irish companies and educational institutions primarily involved in the ICT, educational services, environmental and engineering services, medical devices and food and drinks sectors.</P>
        <P>During the mission, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Chinese Government concerning mutual co-operation and development in software and a joint statement on education was issued. A protocol concerning the opening of trade in pork was also signed.</P>
        <P>The total value of contracts signed between Irish suppliers and Chinese customers in the course of the mission totalled &euro;125.8 million. In addition, four Irish companies &mdash; Kerry Group, AIL, EPS, PUCA &mdash; signed investment contracts worth &euro;46.8 million.</P>
        <P>During the trade mission, over 1,800 meetings were held by the Irish participants with potential and existing customers. I expect that these contacts, and the follow-up which the participating companies will undertake, will lead to substantial additional commercial gains in the future.</P>
        <P>In Beijing, business agreement contracts to a total value of &euro;38.5 million were signed. In addition, agreements in the education sector to the value of &euro;31.4 million were signed.</P>
        <P>In Shanghai, business agreement contracts to a total value of &euro;39 million were signed, and additional agreements within the education sector to the value of &euro;6 million were signed.</P>
        <P>In Hong Kong, business and education sector agreements were signed amounting to &euro;10.9 million in total.</P>
        <P>Trade between Ireland and China-Hong Kong is currently worth &euro;4.8 billion a year &mdash; an increase of 24% on 2003. The CSO estimates that Irish exports to China in 2004 increased by 9% last year over 2003, from &euro;585 million to &euro;639 million, while exports to Hong Kong increased from &euro;688 million to &euro;833 million. More than 250 Irish companies are currently doing business in China and Hong Kong and many have well-established partnerships and business alliances with local companies.</P>
        <P>In the course of the visit, the Taoiseach announced that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to double the value of trade between Ireland and China by 2010. Based on emerging trends and projections, the Government is confident that this can be realised, or even surpassed. In the interim all Government Departments, State and private entities involved will be co-operatively working to that end.</P>
        <P>During the mission, I met a number of representatives from companies which have invested <Col N="922"/>in China and they expressed a general satisfaction with their experience.</P>
        <P>While recognising that democracy and respect for human rights in China are not at the level we would wish, the Government takes the approach of seeking to encourage the Chinese authorities to continue to move in a positive direction. This approach, which situates human rights issues and questions of democratisation within a broad dialogue on matters of mutual concern, is shared by other European and North American governments and is, I believe, the approach most likely to yield tangible long-term progress on these issues, thus leading to greater stability in China.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the liquidation process for Irish Fertiliser Industries; if he has satisfied himself that all possible steps have been taken to protect the interests of former employees of this company who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation of same; if he has any information regarding the proportion of pension entitlement that former workers, including those in Northern Ireland, are likely to receive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the liquidator has made considerable progress in realising the assets of the company and establishing the full extent of its liabilities and that he hopes to complete the liquidation process later this year. At this stage, the plant and machinery at the main production facilities at Arklow and Cork have been sold and are in the process of being dismantled and removed from the sites by the purchasers. The production sites themselves remain the principal assets yet to be realised. It is understood that the liquidator has received an offer for the Cork site and that discussions are ongoing with the prospective buyer, while a number of parties have expressed interest in acquiring the Arklow site. It is a matter solely for the liquidator to determine whether to accept any particular offer made.</P>
        <P>The State has already made a significant financial contribution to assist the former employees of Irish Fertiliser Industries. Following the decision by the board of IFI to put the company into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, while there was no legal obligation to do so, established a special fund with almost &euro;24.5 million to provide <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments to the former employees of IFI. Payments from the fund were made were in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the <Col N="923"/>trustee of the fund, which has been endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.</P>
        <P>In addition, the liquidator has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements in respect of the voluntary severance terms traditionally paid by the company. However, the dividend payable to the workers concerned, if any, can only be determined when all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. It must be emphasised that the amount, if anything, to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for determination by the liquidator.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, I understand that the two main schemes covering employees in the Republic have sufficient funds to meet all of the entitlements provided under the schemes. While I understand that the schemes may not be in a position to provide some additional discretionary benefits that members had hoped to receive, it would appear that the payment of such benefits would always have been conditional on sufficient funding being available to meet the costs involved. I am aware that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardsons&rsquo; pension fund, are likely to receive much reduced pension entitlements. The specific financial position of the Richardsons&rsquo; fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees&rsquo; investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.</P>
        <P>I understand that the UK Government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardsons&rsquo;  scheme. In addition, I understand that the trustees of the various schemes involved have submitted a number of claims to the liquidator of IFI and that he is currently considering, in consultation with his legal and actuarial advisers, whether, and to what extent, these claims are admissible.</P>
        <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Irish Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall that the pension scheme faces.</P>

In addition, an allocation of &euro;301,000 has been made towards workplace safety projects to be implemented in conjunction with the construction safety partnership.</P>
        <P>The authority has a staff of 163, 100 of whom are specifically involved in inspection, investigation and enforcement of health and safety legislation.</P>
        <P>The authority has an ambitious work programme for 2005 which includes an increase in the level of inspections to be undertaken and the related enforcement. Serious accidents and complaints will be prioritised, investigated and any necessary actions taken to ensure the required improvements. New business systems will be implemented to support the inspection and enforcement management systems to enable inspectors to better target places of work for inspection and enforcement.</P>
        <P>In the context of the overall allocation of resources I am confident that the authority can achieve the objectives set out in its work programme for 2005.</P>
        <P>The number of people killed in work related accidents last year was 47 compared to 65 in 2003 and 61 in 2002. While this is the lowest number of deaths since the authority was established in 1989 it is still unacceptable. There is a major challenge to reduce workplace accidents which lead to injuries and deaths. There are responsibilities on the main participants in the workplace &mdash; the workers and employers. The achievement of good health and safety standards in the workplace comes about as a result of interaction, co-operation and joint action towards a mutual goal between staff and management.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 78 together.</P>
        <P>Shortly after the launch of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report in 2004, the Government asked a high level committee under the chairmanship of my Department to advise on the most appropriate means to progress implementation of its recommendations. The Government recently considered and endorsed that committees report, which was broadly supportive of the policy directions recommended by the enterprise strategy group.</P>
        <P>As recognised by the ESG, the environment in which our businesses trade is becoming more global, more competitive and our economy has to become more reliant on knowledge and innovation to win business in tomorrow&rsquo;s technologies and markets. To ensure continued enterprise profitability with robust and quality employment creation potential, I have, earlier today, announced the main findings of the Government concerning implementation of the ESG recommendations. Except in a couple of small areas we can now push ahead with getting the ESG&rsquo;s policy options into effect. Indeed in some areas, significant progress has already been made on a number of the ESG&rsquo;s suggestions.</P>
        <P>As part of this process I will be making regular reports to Government on progress in implementing the ESG&rsquo;s prescriptions, which are imperative to providing the enterprise economy with the momentum for continued prosperity and profitability.</P>
        <P>In drawing up these reports I will be consulting an expert group comprising a number of representatives of the enterprise sector and relevant Secretaries General from Departments will attend those meetings. The expert group will advise me on how implementation milestones are being achieved and any other issues concerning the implementation process.</P>
        <P>Putting in place the ESG&rsquo;s diverse and innovative suggestions is not necessarily a simple and straightforward process given the number of Departments and agencies involved. I will rely on the expert group&rsquo;s depth of experience to advise me about any implementation difficulties and how they can be overcome or circumvented.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 68 together.</P>
        <P>Trade is increasingly recognised as an important and effective lever for development and hence the alleviation of poverty. Ireland, in common with other EU member states, has placed a very clear emphasis on the need to assist developing countries and particularly least developed countries, LDCs, in their integration into the world economy as a necessary condition for their future development. Such integration, which is one element in the process of poverty reduction in the LDCs, will be deeper and fairer if anchored in the WTO multilateral trading system.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with other member states of the EU, in the context of the delivery of the development dimension of the Doha development agenda, is committed to working hard to secure genuinely pro-development outcomes in all areas of the DDA work programme. The DDA negotiations are currently ongoing and in that regard the European Union is giving priority in these negotiations to the achievement of real benefits to the poorest countries through substantial progress on issues of interest to developing and least developed countries. This discussion is taking place across the full range of issues including market access, special and differential treatment and trade-related assistance and capacity building targeted at those most in need.</P>
        <P>By increasing their trade capacity developing countries can enhance export earnings, promote industrialisation and encourage the diversification of their economies. While multilateral trade liberalisation is the priority, effective preference arrangements can provide a stepping <Col N="927"/>stone to help developing countries benefit in the long run from such broader liberalisation. A key instrument for helping developing countries achieve these objectives is the provision of tariff preferences under a generalised scheme of preferences such as the EU&rsquo;s GSP scheme. More recently, in the context of the enhancement of the European Union&rsquo;s generalised scheme of preferences for developing countries, the EU Commission has indicated that it is seeking the earliest adoption of the revised GSP regulation and in any case not later than 1 April 2005. The accelerated entry into force of these preferential trade measures will be to the benefit of tsunami-hit countries and is a direct response to the recent tsunami disaster. The EU GSP, already by far the most generous in the world, provides for further tariff concessions, in particular in the clothing and fisheries sectors, and its benefits will extend to all countries affected by the tsunami with its focus on those most in need such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia. Ireland is fully supportive of and is doing everything to see that the GSP regulation enters into force at the earliest opportunity.</P>

I should point out, in this regard, that the possible transfer of the Shannon free zone assets to the airport authority is just one of a number of options under consideration.

IDA Ireland indicated in its end of year statement for 2004 that it was the best year since 2000 in terms of the quality, depth and value of the investment decisions won and the estimated 10,800 new jobs created. However, more precise data on job creation is compiled from an annual employment survey carried out by Forf&aacute;s and final figures for 2004 will not be available until mid-2005. According to the 2003 survey, which was published in mid-2004, 21 new greenfield projects supported by IDA Ireland started operations during the year, of which one third were in the BMW region. The survey also indicates that 426 existing companies created 8,673 new jobs. Employment data in relation to individual companies is provided on a confidential basis for survey purposes only.</P>

	<P>A Bill to put Ireland&rsquo;s existing employment permit system on a statutory basis is in the final stage of drafting. The intention is to have the Bill enacted before the summer recess. The preparatory stages of this Bill have taken longer than expected because of the change in labour market circumstances, due to the enlargement of the European Union. The proposed employment permits Bill 2005, which will govern the issue of all employment permits for nationals from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, will put the existing employment permit administrative arrangements on a sound legislative footing and, thereby, provide greater accountability and transparency. The EEA comprises the 25 EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.</P>
        <P>It is also intended that the Bill will include provisions that will empower the Minister to issue employment permits of extended or indefinite duration, analogous to a &ldquo;green card&rdquo; type system, where the workers in question are critical to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s skill and employment needs. Our skills and labour needs will be continually assessed and research carried out by F&Aacute;S and the <Col N="930"/>expert group on future skills needs will continue to inform Government policy in this area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 56 together.</P>
        <P>A total of 16 investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor from 1997 onwards. The High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990 in three cases. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002 and it was subsequently published and referred to the DPP. The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Ltd and National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004 and it was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report should be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998, the report on which was referred to the DPP. One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989, the report on which was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>A total of 11 investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990, six of which have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>With regard to the three remaining section 19 investigations, the authorised officer was directed <Col N="932"/>by my predecessor to cease investigative work and to commence writing up his reports with a view to facilitating appropriate follow-up action as soon as possible by the relevant authorities. I recently received a briefing note on the up-to-date position on the section 19 investigations from the authorised officer. I am considering that with the object of ensuring the reports of the authorised officer on his investigations into the three companies are completed by him as soon as possible and that they are made available to the relevant authorities for any action they consider appropriate.</P>
        <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department amount to approximately &euro;10.9 million. This amount does not include the salaries of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs, which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the &euro;10.9 million expended, &euro;1.6 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining &euro;9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &mdash;&euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited/National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
        <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. The High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the Ansbacher inquiry were settled out of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State. With regard to National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank should pay the full costs of the investigation. The costs of the investigation have been borne by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department has requested the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office to commence the process of recovering the full costs of the investigations from the bank. Section 19, as originally enacted, did not provide for the recoupment of costs. It was amended through the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s Statement on Prices and Costs 2004 highlights the key areas that contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s cost base and which affect our competitiveness. The statement also provided the statistical analysis for the NCC&rsquo;s Annual Competitiveness Report 2004, which was published in October together with the <Col N="934"/>council&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge 2004. The challenge offers detailed recommendations designed to address weaknesses in Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance across a range of areas.</P>
        <P>Both the NCC&rsquo;s Statement on Prices and Costs 2004 and Annual Competitiveness Report 2004 found that by 2003 Ireland was on a par with Finland as the most expensive country within the euro zone for goods and services. However, the statement also found that Ireland is the cheapest country in the euro zone for both clothing and footwear. With regard to business costs, the statement found that Ireland is the second most expensive country for electricity costs for industrial users. Ireland&rsquo;s cost competitiveness needs to be improved and this will continue to be a priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Government has already taken several steps to address the issue of prices and costs in Ireland. The Government avoided inflation fuelling increases in indirect taxes for the second year running in budget 2005, thus minimising the Government&rsquo;s contribution to inflation. The most recent consumer price index figures from the CSO show that inflation fell to 2.3% in January compared with 2.6% in December.</P>
        <P>Last year, the Government established the consumer strategy group to advise and make recommendations for the development of a national consumer policy. In the performance of this role the group has carried out a range of activities, including studies that investigate issues of special concern. Price trends in other parts of Europe have been examined and some prices have been the subject of additional investigation, including those of fruit and vegetables, alcoholic beverages and pharmaceuticals.</P>
        <P>High insurance premiums have adversely affected all business operating in Ireland for the past few years. However, the NCC acknowledged that the cost of insurance for many businesses and consumers has reduced over the last year as a result of determined Government actions including the establishment of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB. The Government is, furthermore, committed to increasing competition in all sectors of the economy. The Government recognises that the key to reducing prices and maintaining them at optimal levels in the long term is to ensure that vibrant competition is present in all sectors of the Irish economy. That is why we have strengthened the powers and resources of the Competition Authority, which is charged with combating anti-competitive practice in the economy.</P>
        <P>With regard to the high cost of electricity in Ireland, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently announced plans for a review of the electricity sector. This review will examine the institutional arrangements and market structures and assess <Col N="935"/>their appropriateness. The impetus for this review stems from the perceived difficulties relating to ESB&rsquo;s dominance and the need to attract new entrants and develop competition in the sector. On Monday, 21 February, the Minister formally invited tenders from European and Irish consultancy firms to carry out this review.</P>

	<P>Broad employment and training objectives and polices to promote the employment of disabled people, including schemes, programmes and services, are reflected in the statements of strategy and business plans of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S. F&Aacute;S programmes and the various support measures are based on the policies of the Department, which are developed through a three dimensional approach involving the following: facilitating the progression of disabled people into sustainable employment through the development of their skills; stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution which disabled people can make to their business and encouraging companies to actively consider recruiting disabled people to fill their vacancies; and providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities benefit from the full range of F&Aacute;S training programmes and services and F&Aacute;S also provides an extensive range of schemes and grants to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector including the disability awareness training support scheme, employee retention grant, work and equipment adaptation grant, job interview interpreter grant, personal reader grant and employment support scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, F&Aacute;S also operates the following programmes on behalf of the Department: pilot programme for employment of people with disabilities, PEP &mdash; providing grant assistance for commercially viable enterprises of which at least 50% of the employees are people with disabilities and a supported employment programme &mdash; an open labour market initiative that works towards the placement of and support of people with different types and varying degrees of disability who need the initial support of a job coach to obtain or maintain employment. The numbers of disabled people, in the case of those with a self <Col N="936"/>declared disability, who registered with F&Aacute;S between 2002 and 2004 were as follows:</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 64 together.</P>
        <P>The numbers of workplace inspections-visits undertaken by the labour inspectorate in 2003 was 7,168. The number of workplace inspections-<Col N="937"/>visits undertaken was 5,160 in 2004 while 20 prosecutions initiated by the labour inspectorate in 2003. The labour inspectorate initiated 14 prosecutions. The reduced number of labour inspectorate workplace inspections-visits during 2004 relates to two factors. First, the successful Irish Presidency of the EU in the first half of the year placed significant demands on the labour inspectorate staff. Second, the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress provided that a review be carried out on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The review was carried out by the staff of the labour inspectorate in the second half of 2004. As agreed in the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, four additional inspectors were appointed earlier this year. This has increased the complement of inspectors to 21. The Review of the Mandate and Resourcing of the Labour Inspectorate contains a wide-ranging analysis of the various options regarding the powers of the inspectorate and the number of inspectors required in the future. The report is being considered by the social partners.</P>
        <P>Employment rights legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the labour inspectorate, take the matter before a commissioner in the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, there is no EU-wide corporate governance code. It is a matter for the European Commission to initiate proposals. The Commission has studied the matter comprehensively and concluded that a European corporate governance code would not add significant value but would simply add an additional layer between international principles recently updated at OECD level and national corporate governance codes. The Commission&rsquo;s comparative study of national corporate governance codes revealed a remarkable level of convergence anyway.</P>
        <P>However, the Commission also concluded that the self-regulatory approach that characterises corporate governance codes in most member states was not sufficient to guarantee sound corporate governance. Given the increased integration of European capital markets, it felt that the EU should adopt a common approach on a <Col N="938"/>few essential rules and should ensure adequate monitoring of national corporate governance codes. To this end, the Commission, in its action plan on company law and corporate governance, published in May 2003, included a range of corporate governance initiatives, a number of which are in place while others are under negotiation or still being developed.</P>
        <P>For example, the Commission has put in place a corporate governance forum drawn from relevant interest groups with the job of monitoring corporate governance developments and encouraging ongoing convergence and best practice in the member states. Ireland has a representative on this group. The Commission&rsquo;s action plan was endorsed by the Competitiveness Council in September 2003, the broad approach on the way forward on corporate governance shared by the member states. This is particularly so as far as having a European wide code is concerned.</P>
        <P>While the focus at EU level is on corporate governance applicable to listed companies, at national level here improved corporate governance initiatives applicable to companies generally have been put in place in recent years as follows: proactive enforcement of the provisions of company law by the establishment and resourcing of the multidisciplinary Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement; increased penalties and additional resources to ensure companies meet their filing obligations with the Companies Registration Office; provision of new corporate governance requirements, for example, director&rsquo;s compliance statement in the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 &mdash; these do not apply to smaller companies; establishment of the company law review group on a statutory footing to ensure that the provisions of our company law are consolidated, modernised and simplified, thus making compliance easier; and establishment of IFSRA, which has the job of regulating the financial institutions and exercising important consumer protection powers as regards the provision of financial services to the consumer. Business, markets and the public want companies that operate good corporate procedures and practices throughout the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputies that the Government, along with the State development agencies, is committed to balanced regional development, particularly through the implementation of the national spatial strategy and the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. The State development agencies will continue to work together to attract investment and foster job creation in all regions, including the Border region and the north west.</P>
        <P>Regarding the work of IDA, the board of IDA and the board of Invest Northern Ireland hold an annual joint board meeting to discuss enterprise development strategies, opportunities for collaboration and other topics of mutual interest. One important outcome of those high-level board meetings is a commitment to establish a cross-Border virtual business park centred on Letterkenny and Derry. IDA also attends meetings of the inter-agency planning managers&rsquo; group involving Enterprise Ireland, InterTrade Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland. Those meetings are a further opportunity for discussion of common issues and exchange of information.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland seeks to encourage a balanced spread of regional development throughout all parts of Ireland. In that regard, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of its grant-aid rates. In addition to the funding that it provides directly to clients in the form of equity investments and grants, Enterprise Ireland leverages the venture capital community to invest in early stage companies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland liaise frequently on matters of mutual concern and continue to explore areas for fruitful co-operation. The areas of mutual activity currently <Col N="940"/>include stimulating cross-Border trade, through the Acumen programme, knowledge and technology transfer between academia and industry, through the Fusion programme, and benchmarking, through the Irish Benchmarking Forum, as well as sectoral studies and the development of the equity markets on the island.</P>
        <P>In the case of Invest Northern Ireland, Enterprise Ireland works with its counterpart across a range of activities. Following a meeting between the chief executives of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland, together with their senior management teams, a meeting of the boards of Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland was held in Dundalk during November 2004 to discuss their respective strategies, and further meetings are envisaged. The student enterprise awards are jointly sponsored by Enterprise Ireland, Invest Northern Ireland and Ulster Bank. Other areas of co-operation include sectoral studies and exchanges of experience at a senior level on the development of innovation.</P>
        <P>Regarding the work of InterTrade Ireland, the all-island trade and business development body, it should be noted that InterTrade Ireland does not have a specific regional or sub-regional aspect to its programmes, all of which are all-island in nature and all of which are equally open to businesses from across the island. Under its corporate plan for the period 2005 to 2007, InterTrade Ireland is committed to enhancing the global competitiveness of the island economy to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island, through measures such as the creation of all-island business networks and the implementation of all-island trade and business development programmes. That strategic aim is consistent with recent statements on enterprise strategy both in this State and in Northern Ireland, which emphasise the importance of global competitiveness, innovation, knowledge and value-enhancing collaborative networks. InterTrade Ireland&rsquo;s new corporate plan specifically identifies the importance of collaboration between it and the other economic development agencies on this island. The body&rsquo;s commitment to this form of collaboration is clearly evidenced by the composition of the steering committees of its major programmes, which include representation from agencies North and South and also by the level of consultation which takes place both formally and informally between the agencies on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to a possible shared strategy between economic development agencies North and South, it is the case that the recent enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report has identified a role for North-South co-operation in infrastructure investment and in providing supports to enterprise. The report recognises the potential for collaboration at a business network level and recommends the development of all-island busi<Col N="941"/>ness networks where complementary strengths are identified. I will take into account any opportunities to advance North-South co-operation, for mutual benefit, in the future implementation of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s recommendations that relate to my Department.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the North-South Ministerial Council has been unable to meet since October 2002, due to the ongoing suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Deputy will also be aware that, following the introduction of suspension, the Irish and British Governments agreed that decisions of the North-South Ministerial Council on policies and actions relating to the North-South Implementation Bodies or their respective functions would be taken by the two Governments and that no new functions would be conferred on the bodies while the Assembly remained suspended. Those arrangements were designed to ensure that the bodies would continue to fulfil their important public functions on a &ldquo;care and maintenance&rdquo; basis, pending the restoration of devolved government to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Law Reform Commission, in its consultation paper on corporate killing of October 2003, recommended that a new offence of corporate killing be established which would be prosecuted on indictment, without exclusion of any entity, whether incorporated or not. The offence would apply to acts or omissions of a high managerial agent, which would be treated as those of the undertaking.</P>
        <P>To reflect the seriousness of the offence, the commission also recommended that the legislation should provide for an unlimited fine, or that, in certain circumstances, an individual high managerial agent should also be subject to imprisonment of up to five years. The commission is currently considering submissions on its consultation paper.</P>
        <P>My Department is already in receipt of advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the issue of corporate killing has broad implications.</P>
        <P>As I indicated during Committee Stage of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, which took place on 23 and 24 November last, <Col N="942"/>Government policy is to await the review by the Law Reform Commission, which is due for publication in 2005, and then to decide what is to be done with regard to the issue of corporate manslaughter. The provisions in section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004 entitled Liability of Directors and Officers of Undertakings are more explicit regarding the assignment of responsibility than an existing provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. However, it is worth noting that directors and managers of companies have in the past been prosecuted for failures under occupational safety law which resulted in death or serious injury to workers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department supports the proposed EU chemicals legislation, known as REACH, which proposes the establishment of a compre<Col N="943"/>hensive regulatory framework governing the manufacturing and use of chemicals in the EU, with a view to protecting human health and the environment and maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of EU industry. We are working to ensure that the new regime will be clear and workable and that the right balance will be achieved in meeting the REACH objectives.</P>
        <P>To assist in assessing the potential impact on competitiveness in Ireland, Forf&aacute;s has commissioned consultants to undertake an impact assessment study, which is expected to be finalised shortly. I understand that the key benefit reported by Irish industry in that study is the expected improvement to the availability of chemicals safety and risk management data. That is seen as being of greater benefit by smaller industries and downstream users, who may not have the resources to generate such data.</P>
        <P>It is important to appreciate that even after the new regulation comes into effect, existing legislation, including requirements under the integrated pollution prevention and control and waste-licensing systems, will continue in operation. The primary legislation in those areas is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with operational matters falling to the Environmental Protection Agency, which comes under the aegis of that Department. I understand, however, that information published by the EPA has shown some very positive trends regarding the eco-efficiency of the industrial sector, significant recycling of some industry wastes and progress regarding the level of hazardous waste produced in Ireland over recent years.</P>
        <P>It is unclear what issues the Deputy has in mind in his reference to current issues of industrial misuse of chemicals. If the Deputy has a more specific query in that regard, perhaps he might forward details to me, and I will endeavour to assist him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Total exports from Ireland during the period in question, January to October 2004, amounted to &euro;69.4 billion. That reflects an increase on the same period in the previous year of &euro;1,498.9 million, or 2.2%. The total export sales to the ten new EU member states for the period from January to October 2004 amounted to &euro;586.3 million. That reflects a 3.3%, or &euro;20 mil<Col N="944"/>lion, decrease in exports to the region compared with the same period in 2003.</P>
        <P>To date, exports to those markets from Ireland have been accounted for mainly by multinational companies operating here. For indigenous companies those markets are at a relatively early stage of development, and the Government, through Enterprise Ireland, is rolling out a market development offer to Irish companies to assist them to take full advantage of the export opportunities in those markets.</P>
        <P>One example was the launch, in May 2004, of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s guide to developing economic activity in the new member states entitled Building Your Business in the EU Accession States, in which it outlined the scope for further substantial growth in export business with those markets via the sale of sophisticated products and services.</P>
        <P>Another recent initiative is the Enterprise Ireland GCEE automotive business development programme, launched on 15 February 2005 to meet the growth requirement of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s industrial, software and services clients targeting the German and central and eastern Europe automotive sector as a primary market.</P>
        <P>In addition to the numerous trade missions which have been organised to the majority of the new member states in recent years and the inward buyer visits from the ten which have taken place with Enterprise Ireland support, there will be another mission, to the Czech Republic, in April this year.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has overseas offices in three of the ten new member states, namely, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Exports to those three countries account for 81% of all exports to the region, totalling &euro;477.2 million in January to October 2004, up &euro;13.6 million, or<?oasys _jy?>3%, on the previous period.</P>
        <P>Exports to the ten new EU member states currently account for under 1% of total exports. I am confident that this proportion will increase over time as the benefits of the Single Market begin to come into effect. It is also true that an increasing number of Irish companies are viewing the potential of central and eastern European countries for competitive production with interest, and are using that potential to strengthen their Irish operations. In the longer term, I am confident that our economic relations with our new partners will achieve the levels which reflect the recognised potential.</P>

	<P>Enterprise policy is being actively refocused towards creating conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skill, knowledge-intensive activities and in which advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to growth and employment. That new focus is essential if our enterprises are to capture sustainable competitive advantage in niche markets that are less susceptible to cost-based competition. The range of incentives provided through the enterprise development agencies is designed to meet those objectives and help enterprise operate at higher levels of skill, undertake higher-order strategic investments, product development and innovation. The agencies are active and supportive partners with enterprise in helping new, market-oriented investment projects.</P>
        <P>As Ireland becomes more economically sophisticated, services will become a much more important source of wealth and employment creation. Because of the importance of manufacturing, however, we cannot afford to be complacent about any consistent long-term erosion in employment in such an important economic sector.</P>
        <P>Manufacturing remains at the heart of overseas investment and is likely to do so for a considerable time. That is reflected in changes to tax rules to encourage more research and development activity to take place here, particularly in the area of high-value-added and customer-driven innovation. The sustainability of employment levels in manufacturing is heavily tied to the sustainability of their competitiveness in delivering products and services in Ireland and in export markets. To that end Enterprise Ireland is working with its client base to improve the productivity of this important aspect of our industrial base.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to developing a competitive economy that will be resilient to competitive pressures from today&rsquo;s global economy. That involves maintaining a pro-business environment that will provide firms with a solid stable platform from which they can successfully compete on both domestic and international markets. Our economic and enterprise policies are designed to promote deeper, stronger and more profitable connections with global markets, and to make Ireland one of the most attractive locations in the world from which to do business.</P>

	<P>It was with regret that I learnt of the announcement by Donegal Parian China that it intends to close its plant in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, with the loss 54 jobs.</P>
        <P>I understand that the decision to close is due to a reduction in demand. However, I am also advised that the company is to consolidate its production in its existing Belleek facility and that some 15 of the 54 Donegal employees may be offered employment in Belleek.</P>
        <P>The role of F&Aacute;S will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs. The agency will make its full range of services available to the workers, including advice and training opportunities.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, Enterprise Ireland is also providing information and support for those that might wish to start their own businesses.</P>
        <P>On 2 December last I visited north Donegal and met several groups and companies. I undertook that visit in recognition of the relatively difficult employment situation in Donegal. It is also my intention, in the very near future, to visit south Donegal and meet local interest groups to discuss the employment situation.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is actively marketing all areas of Donegal for new investment and jobs and has invested significant moneys in developing a business park to international standards in Letterkenny. In Ballyshannon itself, the agency has obtained planning permission for a new facility, and a significant amount of site development work has been completed. Also in Ballyshannon, Enterprise Ireland has recently partnered with the local community development company, Erne Enterprise, to develop new high-quality enterprise space. Enterprise Ireland is providing &euro;300,000 in support to this new 10,000 sq. ft. enterprise centre.</P>
        <P>While IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland continue to work with their existing company client base to encourage them to grow, the Donegal County Enterprise Board continues to be active in helping new and existing micro-enterprises in the county.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that tackling the difficulties in Donegal is a priority, a point which I <Col N="947"/>have also reiterated to the State development agencies operating in Donegal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Economic migration policy in Ireland is predicated on economic needs, and it therefore addresses identified labour and skills shortages. As the economy grew in recent years, there was a consequential increase in the demand for labour. Where suitable workers were not available in Ireland or the wider European Economic Area, which consists of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and, for this purpose, Switzerland, the shortage was catered for through the work permit system.</P>
        <P>In a gesture of solidarity with the ten new EU member states, the Government decided to allow free movement to nationals of those countries from accession on 1 May 2004. Because a large proportion of work permits issued in recent years had been granted to nationals of the ten countries in question, it was decided that future economic migration from outside the European Economic Area would be confined to higher-skilled or higher-paid personnel.</P>
        <P>In 2004, 34,000 work permits were issued, of which over 10,000 related to new applications. In addition, in excess of 50,000 nationals of the ten new member states entered the State from May to December 2004.</P>
        <P>Also, the new employment permits Bill now being finalised will contain provisions which will enable me to respond quickly and flexibly to skills shortages in the economy.</P>
        <P>Taking account of those developments and the CSO projections to which the Deputy refers, in combination with the numbers of returning Irish emigrants, I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s labour needs will be met in the years ahead.</P>

	<P>Issues relating to job creation and retention in Enterprise Ireland client companies are day-to-day matters for the agency itself, and not one in which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland informs me that the resurgence in the international economy was reflected in the increase in Enterprise Ireland client export sales during 2004. Irish companies delivered a solid performance during the year, delivering on the growth revival experienced in the latter part of 2003. Companies in the services and high-tech manufacturing sectors, namely, software, ICT, digital media, financial services and health care account for the majority of those increases in export sales, whereas companies operating in the more traditional manufacturing sectors such as food showed more modest increases.</P>
        <P>The positive impact of international market improvements is reflected first in export sales, as illustrated in the &euro;1 billion increase in export sales during 2004. However, the impact on employment can take several months and even years to be fully realised. Factors which influence the time lag include the time taken to recruit and train staff, secure significant international contracts and sales, locate and acquire a suitable site for the companies&rsquo; operations, construct the facility and install plant and machinery.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland recorded a net fall in employment between 2003 and 2004 of 1,317. That reflects a 60% reduction in the net losses compared to the preceding 12-month period, based on strong performance of the high-tech sectors, in particular those companies supported under the Enterprise Ireland high-potential start-up division, as well as the many expansion projects undertaken by Enterprise Ireland-established client companies in the past number of years.</P>
        <P>The majority of job losses &mdash; 90% of the total &mdash; recorded in Enterprise Ireland-supported firms occurred in the food sector, which is facing fundamental change largely driven by CAP reform and WTO negotiations. Ever-changing consumer preferences, rationalisation at retail and production levels, trade liberalisation and increased competition from lower-cost economies will present major challenges to that sector in the years ahead. Enterprise Ireland and other State agencies will continue to assist companies in the sector to increase competitiveness, undertake research and development into new products, and assist penetration into new export markets.</P>

	<P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health.</P>
        <P>The management of health and safety in all sectors of employment is based on the principles of legislation, enforcement, information and awareness-raising, coupled with a partnership approach involving all the main players. The partnership approach was further advanced with the establishment, in November 1999, of the Construction Safety Partnership, or CSP, which includes representatives of the CIF, ICTU, HSA and other relevant agencies and Departments. The overall aim of the CSP is to achieve the highest possible standard of safety, health and welfare in Irish construction.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is fully committed to furthering the principles agreed by the CSP and is actively engaged with all parties to the CSP in enhancing safety, health and welfare on sites.</P>
        <P>Among the major initiatives undertaken and ongoing are the safe pass and construction skills certification schemes. Greater employee rep<Col N="950"/>resentation in health and safety matters and the safety representative facilitation scheme has been further supported to continue the work of increasing safety consultation on sites.</P>
        <P>In 2004, HSA inspectors visited over 5,000 construction sites and closed 26, one by court order and 25 by agreement, until safety deficiencies were remedied and safety management systems put in place.</P>
        <P>The HSA also has an advisory role illustrated by a range of initiatives including the development of a code of practice for safety in roof work, the development of a code of practice for avoiding danger from underground services, the approval of Irish Standard 360: 2004 Code of Practice: Safe Use of Cranes in the Construction Industry as a code of practice for the purposes of the safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001, and ongoing drafting work on the development of a wide range of other construction safety guidance material.</P>
        <P>The authority recently published a new aid, the safe system of work plan, or SSWP, aimed at reducing injuries and deaths on construction sites. That initiative relies on pictograms to explain and clarify hazards and controls, thereby creating a wordless document where safety can be communicated to all workers, regardless of language skills. The safe system of work plan aims to focus on those in the construction industry who are most at risk and empowering them to ensure that all necessary safety controls are in place prior to the commencement of planned work.</P>

        <Quest>his views on the recent consumer prices average analysis for Dublin and outside Dublin produced by the CSO which showed a wide variation in prices being charged for goods and services throughout the country and which disclosed that a number of items in Dublin were consistently more expensive than in other parts of the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The analysis to which the Deputy refers resulted from an initiative whereby data for average prices in Dublin and outside <Col N="950"/>Dublin in May 2004 was published by the Central Statistics Office last July &mdash; drawn from the national average prices published for the consumer price index. This initiative, which resulted from close co-operation between my Department, the CSO, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Consumers&rsquo; Association of Ireland and Forf&aacute;s, continued with the publication of figures for November being brought forward to December. I issued a statement on the 16 December welcoming the analysis and outlining my reaction to it.</P>
        <P>The aim of this initiative is to provide data to consumers on prices, given that differences in the prices of goods and services are an ongoing aspect of an open economy. I have noted that 48 of the <Col N="951"/>73 prices involved in the analysis were higher in Dublin than outside of Dublin with 24 lower and one showing no difference. Prices in Dublin for meat, fish and most fruit and vegetables were generally higher but prices of most of the other food products were lower except standard and large eggs, spaghetti and orange juice.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the prices of goods and services are determined by factors such as outlet location and size, brand and quality. The location of a business will have implications for costing of any goods and services provided in terms of overheads such as transport, rent and insurance.</P>
        <P>The data also provides consumers with an indication of the average prices for 73 goods and services. Consumers in Dublin, for example, could note an average price in November for various cuts of meat and compare this with the prices they were paying. They could also note that the average price for a litre of milk in November was 80 cent, a white sliced loaf was &euro;1.06, a pint of stout was &euro;3.73 and a ladies&rsquo; wash, cut and blow dry &euro;33.14. Consumers outside Dublin were paying 88 cent, &euro;1.16, &euro;3.42 and &euro;29.86 for these goods and services. With this information in hand consumers were in a position to shop around for cheaper alternatives or to ask suppliers providing these goods and services at higher prices why they were charging above the average.</P>
        <P>My Department proposes to continue building on this initiative in order to get more user-friendly data to consumers on prices and will continue to work with the CSO, ODCA, CAI and Forf&aacute;s in this regard. In addition, I will continue to support the work of the Competition Authority on an ongoing basis and the work of the Director of Consumer Affairs who has been proactively undertaking price surveys and bringing their results to the attention of the public.</P>
        <P>While we are working on getting information to consumers, we also need to support consumers so that they can be confident in raising queries with suppliers. Arising from the concern about the imbalance between consumers and more vocal and more powerful lobbies the consumer strategy group was set up last March and I await formal publication of its report. I will be carefully considering the group&rsquo;s findings and recommendations and I look forward to building on its work and to developing a modern and responsive consumer policy for the years ahead.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Relocation is just one factor in the many enterprise related issues that determine employment levels. Firms invest in different regions for a variety of reasons and while there is little doubt that some firms establish themselves primarily to take advantage of reduced costs in lower wage economies this is often not the only factor in deciding where to invest. It is not possible to monitor the extent to which jobs are relocated to lower wage economies with any degree of accuracy or to determine the employ<Col N="953"/>ment change arising directly from just one aspect affecting the enterprise economy.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2-?>
        <P>The competitive characteristics of our enterprise base has made a reliance on low technology, basic manufacturing less sustainable than it was in the past. There has been a fundamental shift in the strengths and competitive advantages of our economy, which is now typified by higher output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards. Clearly, a more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably attract some firms that are unable to produce in the high-wage, high skill environment of modern Ireland. The continuing structural transformation of our economy is inevitable. With this, some plant transfers and other adjustments are bound to come, but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities.</P>
        <P>To counterbalance the competitive threat from lower cost competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of competitiveness and value added products and services. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy and that are therefore less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. This new investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. Given the critical mass of FDI in Ireland and its linkages with indigenous companies, one of the greatest potential contributions will come from developing companies already operating here. The enterprise development agencies are working to encourage companies into more sophisticated activities where competitive advantage is less likely to be whittled away by cost based competition.</P>

        <P>On foot of a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with the social partners, I decided that with effect from 10 November 2004 the three year cap would be removed for CE participants aged 55 or over. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on community employment for a maximum of six years. The extension of the participation cap from three to six years for over 55s should ensure that there will be sufficient clients to fill the available places. The practice of ring-fencing and prioritisation for the essential services of child care, health related services and drugs task force clients are being maintained.</P>
        <P>The continuation of ring-fencing and the extended participation on community employment by older workers will help to secure the continuity of community services generally and will ensure that the existing community service support framework will be maintained.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few years Irish manufacturing firms, particularly in the more traditional sectors, have operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure, and an increasingly competitive international environment &mdash; China, central and eastern Europe &mdash; together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the euro against our key trading partner currencies. In an increasingly globalised economy lower skilled manufacturing type operations are migrating to lower wage economies. The replacement of the inevitable job losses is a tough challenge.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the development agencies and industry to address this issue and seeks to support new and existing firms at all stages of business development and in a balanced regional manner.</P>
        <P>During 2005, the 35 city and county enterprise boards will continue to actively co-operate with both the south and east and Border, midlands and west regional assemblies in developing indigenous micro-enterprises throughout the regions. The boards provide a comprehensive system of <Col N="955"/>capital and employment grants, support, mentoring, and training and development initiatives for new and existing micro-enterprises.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, the agency which has prime responsibility for supporting indigenous industry, provides funding for innovation development, upskilling within client companies and developing export opportunities in overseas markets. In addition, the agency provides advice and referrals for clients to improve their competitive position.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness fund was set up to help small and medium enterprises, SMEs, overcome distinctive competitiveness difficulties. Under this fund, which closed in mid-2004, 97 applications, to the value of just under &euro;12 million, were approved for companies predominantly operating in the traditional manufacturing sectors. The total investments forecast in these firms as a result of Enterprise Ireland investments will amount to over &euro;41 million over a two year period. This investment, together with other Enterprise Ireland supports and services, has revitalised many firms in these sectors, ensuring continued commitment to employment and sales in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is the agency charged with attracting foreign direct investment to this country. In its end of year statement for 2004, IDA Ireland has stated that manufacturing remains at the heart of overseas investment in the Irish economy. However, the quality of these investments and the types of jobs have changed considerably in recent years. In order to achieve a continuing high level of FDI and of investment from existing clients, IDA Ireland is concentrating more resources on helping to underpin the competitiveness of existing overseas companies in Ireland, by encouraging existing clients to move up the value chain into higher value products and services and into higher order functions, such as R &amp; D. It seeks out niches of business in which Ireland can carve out world market leadership in a medium term.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for the people of this country.</P>

        <P>It is a requirement of the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange that publicly quoted companies disclose annually the remuneration of the directors in their annual reports.</P>
        <P>At EU level the European Commission recently adopted a recommendation relating to remuneration of directors of publicly quoted companies which member states will be required to implement by the middle of 2006.

Many of the principles and guidelines of this recommendation already apply to publicly quoted companies here on foot of the listing rules of the Irish Stock Exchange. However, one of the new elements provided for in the recommendation is that disclosure of directors pay extend to managing directors and chief executive officers of such companies regardless of whether or not they are members of the board of the company.</P>

        <Quest> further to Question No. 48 of 17 February 2005, her views on whether best cancer patient outcomes are achieved when the three treatment modalities, surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are available in one hospital location and the overall policy framework she is developing relates only to the development of private facilities on public hospital sites; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6406/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s objective is to provide a model of cancer care which ensures that patients with cancer receive the most appropriate and best quality of care regardless of their place of residence. In order to achieve this objective, an integrated and co-ordinated approach is required, which encompasses prevention, screening, cancer treatment, including medical, surgical and radiation oncology, education, training and research.</P>
        <P>Government policy in relation to radiation oncology services is based on the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. The group which prepared the report for<Col N="960"/>mulated guidelines for the development of additional radiation therapy facilities as follows: a sufficient patient population should exist within a proposed catchment area to support the future development of a radiation oncology service; a radiation oncology service should enable maximum patient access to the highest quality service; other clinical specialties and support services that enable the appropriate function and development of a radiation oncology centre and-or supra-regional cancer centre should exist on the site; radiation oncology must be part of organised multi-disciplinary cancer care; a radiation oncology service should take account of patient groups with special needs; a radiation oncology service should develop links between those hospitals providing radiation oncology care and other hospitals involved in the provision of cancer care but without physical treatment facilities; and where radiation oncology facilities are not available on site, it will be important to provide appropriate outreach services particularly through the development of joint clinical and other appointments between hospitals and-or health boards.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the application of these guidelines in the development of radiation oncology services as part of a multi-disciplinary cancer service will best ensure that cancer patients have access to the highest quality of care. The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years.</P>
        <P>We are determined to deliver enhanced services for the whole population as soon as possible. There is unanimity about the urgent need for significantly enhanced services in the major population centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway. I will keep the question of networked satellite locations under active review. The immediate developments in Cork and Galway will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. Five additional consultant radiation oncologists are being recruited for this service. These developments will significantly improve access to radiotherapy for patients throughout the country.</P>
        <P>As recommended in the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland, the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group, NROCG, has been established. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group&rsquo;s remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group is expected to develop proposals in these important areas. The group will also advise on quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities. <Col N="961"/>The group is also in the process of developing a national telesynergy network for radiation oncology services which will enable hospitals to develop improved linkages with the supra-regional radiation oncology centres in Galway and Cork and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin and reduce patient and consultant travel time.</P>
        <P>In relation to the development of private facilities on public hospital sites, I am in the process of developing an overall policy framework which will identify the policy issues which need to be addressed and the key criteria to be applied. I hope to complete this work in a matter of weeks.</P>

	<P>There is a common list of reimbursable medicines for the general medical services and drug payment schemes. This list ensures equity between the schemes in relation to the range of medicines paid for by the State. The list is reviewed and amended monthly, as new products become available and deletions are notified.</P>
        <P>For an item to be included on the common list, it must comply with a published list of criteria. These include authorisation status where appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.</P>
        <P>A medical cardholder who experiences financial difficulty in obtaining items not on the common list should approach the health board for assistance.</P>
        <P>There is an agreement in place between my Department, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland on the supply terms, conditions and prices of medicines supplied to the health services, that is, the general medical services, other community drug schemes, Health Service Executive and hospitals. One of <Col N="963"/>the conditions of the agreement is that the price to wholesaler of each item of medicine covered by the agreement may not be increased for the term of the agreement. The manufacturers of the product referred to by the Deputy applied to my Department for a price increase in December 2003 which was refused. The product was subsequently removed from the list of reimbursable drugs and medicines at the manufacturer&rsquo;s request. However, because of the indications for which this product is prescribed, my Department is reviewing the matter.</P>

Where it is not <Col N="964"/>possible to treat patients within a reasonable period in Ireland, either in public or private hospitals, arrangements can be made to refer the public patients for treatment abroad, having regard to quality, availability and cost.

The Mental Health Commission, established under the provisions of the Act, is currently putting in place the infrastructure required for its commencement.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, mental health tribunals, operating under the aegis of the Mental Health Commission, will conduct a review of each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient on an involuntary basis or to extend the duration of such detention. The review will be independent, automatic and must be completed within 21 days of the detention-extension order being signed. As part of the review process the mental health tribunal will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist and the commission will also operate a scheme to provide legal aid to patients whose detention is being reviewed by a tribunal.</P>
        <P>While the detailed work programme of the Mental Health Commission is a matter for the commission itself to determine, in accordance with its statutory functions under the Mental Health Act 2001, I understand that the establishment of the mental health tribunals is a priority for the commission.</P>

        <P>Persons who were in publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes are covered by the terms of the Supreme Court judgment. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 regulates the private nursing home sector. Under the nursing home subvention regulations, the HSE is empowered to make a financial contribution to an individual towards the cost of his or her private nursing home care provided he or she qualifies on means and dependency grounds. In the case of private nursing home care the contract of care is between the individual and the private nursing home owner. Accordingly, the provisions of the Supreme Court judgment do not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who entered homes under the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as part of their modernisation programme, they have invested heavily in the provision of Internet based services and the Revenue on-line service, ROS, has been widely acknowledged as a major success both from a technological and customer service point of view. Revenue adds to the range of services available on ROS on an ongoing basis and during 2003 vehicle registration was added to the suite of on-line services. With the support of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the service has become extremely popular and in January 2005 the percentage of new vehicles registered on-line reached 86%. As a consequence, the demand for contact services at vehicle registration offices has declined substantially.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have reviewed the implications of these changes and, having regard to the reduction in service demand, have decided to close a number of the smaller vehicle registration offices and consolidate the service in adjacent offices and to reduce the opening hours in others. Decisions on opening hours and clos<Col N="968"/>ures were made on a case by case basis having regard to customer service demands and cost efficiency.</P>
        <P>Revenue continues to provide a high level of service to car dealers, including dealers in Roscommon. Almost all vehicles are registered in real time, either on-line or by fax. Discussions have been held with SIMI on an ongoing basis about the new arrangements. Revenue will continue to market the use of on-line registration with a view to further increasing take-up.</P>

	<P>Qualification for the tax concessions under the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme is by reference to specified medical criteria, as set out in the 1994 regulations. In this regard, six different types of disablement are listed and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of their lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</P>
        <P>It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect, issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer who is an official of the local health board. I have no function in deciding whether individual certificates are issued. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused, this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 to 115, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>At the outset, I inform the Deputy that the questions posed by him in regard to the design of the upstream pipeline compared to the design of the transmission pipelines used by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann do not compare like with like.</P>
        <P>Transmission pipelines used by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann are designed using IS 328. In the case of the Corrib onshore gas pipeline, BS8010 is used for the design code. IS 328 has been used as a supplement to BS8010 where it was considered beneficial. Design codes in general allow themselves to be supplemented by other similar codes where they are either silent or do not provide clear guidance. What is not normally permitted is for sections of one design code to be substituted by another one.</P>
        <P>The Corrib onshore pipeline has certain design considerations, which are unusual and unique both within Ireland and also within Europe, and for this reason there is no direct precedent. The design requires consideration to be given to the choice of design code best suited to the project. The Corrib export pipeline has, for the onshore section, an extremely high design pressure of 345 bar. Thus, the pipeline is well above the normal design pressure experienced for onshore distribution gas pipelines. This has resulted from the <Col N="971"/>relatively rare occurrence where the pipeline is connected directly to the producing wells and not via an intermediate platform or processing facility as happens in most other cases.</P>
        <P>Since the onshore pipeline has no direct precedent either within Ireland or elsewhere for the reasons stated above, it is clear that strict use of the Irish design standard applied to all Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann transmission and distribution pipelines, IS 328, results in a design that is not optimised for wall thickness and less practical to construct.</P>
        <P>The Deputy is aware that an independent evaluation of the onshore pipeline design code was commissioned by my Department. This was carried out by Mr. Andrew Johnston, an experienced petroleum pipeline consultant. His report, Corrib Gas Pipeline Project: Report on Evaluation of Onshore Pipeline Design Code, was submitted to my Department on 28 March 2002 and its recommendations have been included as conditions attaching to the consent to construct pipelines issued in April 2002.</P>
        <P>Mr. Johnston concluded as follows: the pipeline design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions; the design of the onshore pipeline is generally in accordance with code selection and best national and international industry practice, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 of his report are followed; the pipeline is considered to be adequately protected from third-party interference by burial to 1.2 m and provision of marker tape above the pipeline; and the pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements as outlined in the selected design code, provided that the actions recommended in section 2.2 are followed. As stated above, the recommendations of section 2.2 have been incorporated in the statutory approvals issued for the Corrib pipeline development. I have forwarded a copy of Mr. Johnston&rsquo;s report to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I should also point out that the upstream pipeline will be buried in a trench generally of 2 m in depth adjacent to the umbilical and the waste pipe in the same trench. While the umbilical will carry high-pressure liquids the volumes are very small and the umbilical will also be buried to a depth of 2 m so these liquids will pose no threat to people in the area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s reference to licensing relates to the scheme for the licensing of traditional pot-fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet. The implementation of this scheme is a matter for the Licensing Authority for Sea-fishing Boats, which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003. This Act provides that the licensing authority shall not grant a fishing boat licence unless an independent survey of the boat confirms that it is safe and seaworthy.</P>
        <P>I understand from the licensing authority that last July, letters of licence offer were issued to the successful applicants under that scheme, specifying the conditions to be complied with in order for their boats to be licensed, including the requirement that the boats comply with the code of practice on the safety of fishing vessels less than 15 m in overall length.</P>
        <P>Radio regulations governing all sizes of fishing vessels were introduced in 1998. All fishing vessels must comply with the requirements of the Fishing Vessel (Radio Installations) Regulations 1998 and are surveyed in accordance with the Fishing Vessel (Radio Installations Survey) Regulations 1999. The enforcement of these regulations is carried out by the marine survey office of the Department, which inspects vessels to ensure they are complying with the safety standards laid down.</P>
        <P>While Bord Iascaigh Mhara provides radio courses, there are also a number of radio courses provided by private operators in the market which comply with the code of practice guidelines and regulations. Ensuring the safety of both the vessel and its crew is the paramount issue and I urge all fishermen to take the responsible approach to ensure that both radio equipment and the requirements regarding the training of radio personnel are fully complied with.</P>
        <P>The licensing authority set a deadline of 11 March this year for compliance with all the conditions of the licence offer. This deadline was set having regard to European Community requirements that the licensing and registration of all fishing boats be completed as soon as possible. I understand from the licensing authority that where applicants have difficulty meeting this deadline due to the practicalities of arranging necessary training and securing the required radio competency certification, the authority will allow some extra weeks to give them an opportunity to comply with the requirements of the code of practice. However, it is not in a position to grant a substantial extension due to the need <Col N="973"/>to ensure that Ireland complies with European Community requirements on the registration of fishing boats.</P>

The opening of new Irish missions and the upgrading of existing missions is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis.

	<P>Entrepreneurship in Ireland is supported and encouraged by the constant pursuit and promotion by the Government of an economic environment supportive of entrepreneurial activity combined with a wide range of targeted interventions by various State enterprise development agencies.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s extraordinary success over the past decade has been built on key competitive strengths such as having one of the lowest taxation regimes in Europe, access to the EU&rsquo;s Internal Market, a well educated and skilled workforce and a history of pursuing Government policies that are pro business and provide a benign business environment. The Government is committed to the continued support and development of these strengths.</P>
        <P>The Government also supports the relevant State agencies in the delivery of a wide range of interventions that are designed to encourage and support entrepreneurs. Examples include the training and mentoring provided to new entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises by the network of <Col N="975"/>35 city and county enterprise boards. The boards also promote entrepreneurship within schools through their schools enterprise programmes including the annual student enterprise awards scheme.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is responsible for helping and supporting the development of new Irish enterprises, built on successfully harnessing the creativity and innovation of home grown entrepreneurs. Examples of the programmes run by Enterprise Ireland include the enterprise platform programme, a one-year rapid incubation programme designed to provide hands-on support and management development for entrepreneurs who wish to start their own business. The State, through Enterprise Ireland, is also actively engaged in supporting the establishment of the necessary physical infrastructure to facilitate new and emerging innovative businesses.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is working with third level institutes of technology to develop on-campus incubation centres to facilitate the generation of new, high growth companies. A new initiative has been put in place which will see the institutes of technology receive up to &euro;30 million for the establishment of business incubation centres. It is expected that by the end of 2005 all institutes of technology will have their own incubation centre.</P>
        <P>In the mid-west region, Shannon Development&rsquo;s new business department is based in the Limerick InnovationWorks facility on the National Technology Park, Limerick. InnovationWorks is part of the Shannon Development knowledge network which has delivered a number of world class locations across the region for living and working in the knowledge age.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development&rsquo;s venture development process is the engine by which high potential entrepreneurs and firms are supported at each stage in their growth and development cycle. An important module in that process is the venture start one programme, designed for people considering a career move and the entrepreneurship option. It offers them an opportunity to explore the entrepreneurship process, what it involves and helps them to determine if entrepreneurship is the route that they should take.</P>
        <P>The national training and employment authority, F&Aacute;S, organises a range of courses aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship and business formation. These include courses in assessing business opportunities to provide the participants with the skills and related knowledge that will enable them to assess business opportunities; business appraisal training programme to develop and appraise the participants&rsquo; enterprise skills; provide them with the necessary skills and knowledge required to assess the feasibility of business projects; help them identify any further action/training required to set up in business and prepare a business plan outlining the viability of <Col N="976"/>the project. Other courses include start your own business which provides participants with the knowledge and skills to understand the key elements/processes required in starting a business and to conduct a personal assessment and to conduct a business assessment.</P>
        <P>The critical role of entrepreneurship is fully recognised by the Government and the actions being taken are achieving the objective of ensuring that we have an entrepreneurial society. The 2004 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, the premier cross-national assessment of entrepreneurship, shows Ireland performing extremely well in entrepreneurship activity; Ireland is second in total entrepreneurial activity among EU member states.</P>

	<P>Support for job creation and investment in individual counties is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies. IDA Ireland has responsibility for foreign direct investment. Enterprise Ireland concentrates on the indigenous sector and the county enterprise boards have primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector. While the agencies caution that decisions regarding investments and job creation are ultimately a matter for individual investors, they are optimistic in regard to job creation from new and expansion projects in 2005.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in assisting Kildare-based client companies to grow and develop their businesses, with a view to facilitating the creation of new jobs and the retention of existing jobs. Over the past three years the agency has approved &euro;9.3 million in support to companies to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development to compete on world markets. Enterprise Ireland is supporting the development of community enterprise centres in County Kildare at Allenwood, Clane and Athy, which when fully operational, are expected to significantly contribute to further job creation.</P>
        <P>One main sector of indigenous industry in County Kildare is food and consumer products. This sector accounts for a major part of the employment growth within the county. Green Isle Foods in Naas, for example, has already announced expansion plans which are expected to create 130 jobs.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland advises that significant developments in overseas investment were announced <Col N="977"/>for the county in 2004, such as the largest ever ICT investment in the country by Intel of &euro;1.6 billion and a &euro;21.4 million technology development centre by Hewlett Packard. County Kildare has benefited from a significant investment in recent years in technological infrastructure in the National University Ireland, Maynooth. This will be the key to ensuring that County Kildare is an attractive location for knowledge-based industry in future years.</P>
        <P>While it is difficult to predict foreign direct investment in 2005, the agency expects employment trends to continue, with overseas companies in the county such as Wyeth Medica, Oral B, Tegral Products, IFS, all continuing to provide solid job opportunities.</P>
        <P>One of the main priorities for the Kildare County Enterprise Board in 2005 will be to continue to meet with existing and potential entrepreneurs who are starting or growing their business. In 2004 the board paid out over &euro;341,457 in grant assistance to micro-enterprises in the region. The board advises that they will be making every effort to ensure that available funds in 2005 are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development in the county, thereby continuing to deliver on their record of employment development in the area.</P>
        <P>The latest live register figures show that unemployment in the county has decreased from 4,921 in January 2004 to 4,430 in January 2005, a decrease of almost 10%. This data indicates that any job losses that may have occurred in the county are being offset by employment opportunities in other sectors.</P>
        <P>The strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development, 750 public servants are to be relocated in the county, will continue to bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for County Kildare in 2005.</P>

	<P>Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. Despite the slowdown in the global economy the Irish labour market has been very resilient with employment continuing to grow and unemployment remaining stable.</P>
        <P>Statistics on job creation and job losses are obtained from the Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey. According to the latest available survey for the third quarter of 2004, 1,893,600 persons were in employment in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of 57,200 or 3.1% in the year. This is the highest level of annual growth recorded since the 3.8% recorded in the first quarter of 2001. Quarter on quarter, there was a seasonal increase of over 57,000 persons in employment. When seasonal factors are taken into account employment showed an increase of 13,200 in the quarter.</P>
        <P>There were 93,900 persons unemployed in the third quarter, representing a decrease of 4,900 in the year. The seasonally adjusted unemployment figure stood at 86,600, representing a decrease of 1,500 in the quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.4%.</P>
        <P>While job losses have been experienced in some sectors, the above statistics indicate that they are being offset by employment opportunities in others. Detailed figures for 2004 for job gains and losses in client-supported companies of the industrial development agencies will not be available until mid 2005 when the annual Forf&aacute;s employment survey is published.</P>

	<P>Ireland exports across the globe. As such, there are virtually no markets to which Irish companies do not export. The Government&rsquo;s strategy is to assist companies, through Enterprise Ireland, on an individual basis to deepen market penetration where they are already active and to identify opportunities in markets where they have not yet achieved significant penetration.</P>
        <P>In terms of export destinations, the EU is by far our most important market, accounting for 64% of the total in 2002, 61.3% in 2003 and 62.2% for the January to October period in 2004, the latest for which statistics are available. The 2004 figure includes the ten countries which acceded to the EU on 1 May of that year.</P>
        <P>The drop in the percentage of exports going to the EU is accounted for almost entirely by a drop in exports to the UK, which was caused by an unusual trading pattern, thought to be related to a VAT fraud in the UK, in the years before 2003. The UK accounted for 17.7% of exports in the January-October period last year, having <Col N="980"/>accounted for 18.2% of the total in 2003 and 24% in 2002.</P>
        <P>The US is now our largest single export market taking 19.9% of exports in the January-October period last year. It took 20.6% in 2003 and 17.6% in 2002. Total exports to the US declined by an estimated 2.5% in 2004 following increases of 4.4% in 2002 and 2.6% in 2003. This fall is thought to be due principally to the rising value of the euro against the dollar.</P>
        <P>Exports to Asia in 2004 have proved to be very positive, growing by over 10% in the January-October period over the same period in 2003. Of particular note is the increase of 20% in exports to China and Hong Kong, reflecting both China&rsquo;s strength as an emerging manufacturing sector and the Government&rsquo;s focus on developing economic relations with China under the Asia strategy. It also justifies the Government&rsquo;s determination to reinforce the effectiveness and relevance of the strategy in its next phase, as announced by the Taoiseach during his recent visit to China.</P>

	<P>Over the past 15 years, Ireland has emerged as one of the most globalised economies in the world. This is a reflection of our extremely strong record in attracting investment and growing trade.</P>
        <P>This open structure means that we have unusually high levels of both exports and imports. Since our domestic economy is so highly internationalised, it is estimated that approximately two thirds of our imports are used by industry in Ireland as input materials, and are subsequently re-exported after integration in higher value products.</P>
        <P>As such, the strength of imports is a reflection of the strength of home production &mdash; indeed, a change in the pattern of imports, either positive or negative, is usually followed in subsequent months by a corresponding change in exports. Furthermore, imports contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of the economy and so strengthen the base of our industry and services.</P>
        <P>The pattern of imports in the past two and a half years has done nothing to change this situation. However, the Government recognises the need for Irish industry to maintain and accelerate its progress towards higher value-added industries, a process which is necessary as a result of our increasing prosperity. In certain products, we simply cannot match the cost base of low cost production centres. Where companies are negatively affected by lower cost imports, the Government, through its economic development agen<Col N="981"/>cies and principally Enterprise Ireland, can offer advice and assistance to them to enable them to adjust to the new situation and maintain growth.</P>

	<P>Between 17 and 25 January 2005, I accompanied the Taoiseach on an official visit and trade mission to China. The Ministers for Education and Science, Agriculture and Food and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources also participated. The trade mission was the largest in the history of the State, involving in total 121 Irish companies and educational institutions primarily involved in the ICT, educational services, environmental and engineering services, medical devices and food and drinks sectors.</P>
        <P>During the mission, a memorandum of understanding was signed with the Chinese Government concerning mutual co-operation and development in software and a joint statement on education was issued. A protocol concerning the opening of trade in pork was also signed. The total value of contracts signed between Irish suppliers and Chinese customers in the course of the mission totalled &euro;125.8 million. In addition, four Irish companies, Kerry Group, AIL, EPS, PUCA, signed investment contracts worth &euro;46.8 million.</P>
        <P>During the trade mission, over 1,800 meetings were held by the Irish participants with potential and existing customers. I expect that these contacts, and the follow-up which the participating companies will undertake, will lead to substantial additional commercial gains in the future.</P>
        <P>In Beijing, business agreement contracts to a total value of &euro;38.5 million were signed. In addition, agreements in the education sector to the value of &euro;31.4 million were signed. In Shanghai, business agreement contracts to a total value of &euro;39 million were signed, and additional agreements within the education sector to the value of &euro;6 million were signed. In Hong Kong, business and education sector agreements were signed amounting to &euro;10.9 million in total.</P>
        <P>Trade between Ireland and China-Hong Kong is currently worth &euro;4.8 billion a year &mdash; an increase of 24% on 2003. The CSO estimates that Irish exports to China in 2004 increased by 9% last year over 2003, from &euro;585 million to &euro;639 million, while exports to Hong Kong increased from &euro;688 million to &euro;833 million. More than 250 Irish companies are currently doing business in China and Hong Kong and many have well-established partnerships and business alliances with local companies.</P>
        <P>In the course of the visit, the Taoiseach announced that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention <Col N="982"/>to double the value of trade between Ireland and China by 2010. Based on emerging trends and projections, the Government is confident that this can be realised, or even surpassed. In the interim, all Departments, State and private entities involved will be co-operatively working to that end.</P>

	<P>The living alone allowance is an additional payment of &euro;7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are living alone. It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and are receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.</P>
        <P>The allowance was last increased in 1996. For many years, the policy in relation to support for pensioners has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates for all pensioners, rather than supplementary payments such as the living alone allowance. This approach ensures that the position of all our pensioners is improved. Any change in policy in relation to the living alone allowance would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <Quest> if he will report on the actual number of women aged 70 and over who have no independent means, property or pension; if he will consider in view of this unacceptable situation, the introduction of a guaranteed basic income which would be an entitlement on the basis of being a citizen of the State, as recommended by the Conference of Religious of Ireland.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Data from the Central Statistics Office show there were 180,800 women aged 70 and over in the State in 2003. Almost 157,000, or 87%, of those women received social welfare payments in their own right, with further numbers of women being paid as qualified adults on their spouse&rsquo;s pension. This means that the majority of women over 70 years of age and resident in Ireland are receiving social welfare support.</P>
        <P>Where the payments being made are contributory pensions, no reference is made to any additional income or assets a person may have, as it is not assessable. In the case of assistance based schemes or receiving a payment as a qualified adult, the payment is made subject to a means test and levels may be reduced by reference to means. However, given the disregards before <Col N="983"/>income or capital are assessed as means, many people may have additional income or assets without affecting their rate of payment. No person in the State, without means, would be left without necessary financial support.</P>
        <P>A Green Paper on basic income was published in 2002 by the Department of the Taoiseach to contribute to an informed debate among the wider community on the benefits of basic income, while also identifying the effects of such an approach.</P>
        <P>The introduction of a basic income system in Ireland would represent not only a fundamental shift in the way in which we organise social protection in this country, but would also imply a radical overhaul of the taxation system. The Green Paper summarises those implications together with identifying the main advantages and disadvantages associated with the proposal.</P>
        <P>The key test in any radical proposal of this nature is whether or not the gains which are claimed can be achieved through a more gradual reform of the existing system. The Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 briefly considered a basic income type approach but rejected these in favour of a reform of the existing systems. Proponents of a basic income system would have to make a convincing case as to why such improvements cannot continue to be made in the context of the current system, instead of opting for the uncertainties and risks of a basic income approach.</P>
        <P>In this context, the Government has committed, under An Agreed Programme for Government and Sustaining Progress, to increasing the payment for qualified adults age 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension at an estimated cost of &euro;44 million. Considerable progress has already been made in this regard with the qualified adult allowance on the contributory payment now standing at &euro;138.50 or 83% of the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension, currently &euro;166.00 per week. Overall, increases in the qualified adult allowance on the old age contributory pension amount to &euro;56.47 per week since April 2000. At the same time, the qualified adult allowance on the old age non-contributory pension has increased by &euro;44.05 per week and now stands at 66% of the full personal rate.</P>

	<P>The unemployment benefit scheme is designed to provide income support for people who have lost employment and who are unable for find alternative employment.</P>
        <P>Social welfare legislation provides that, in order to be entitled to an unemployment payment, a person must prove,<i> inter alia</i>, that he or she is available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work. There is an onus on each person to demonstrate, on an ongoing basis, that these conditions are met by showing that he or she is making reasonable efforts to secure full-time employment or self-employment.</P>
        <P>In the case of a person who suffers a temporary reduction in his or her working week, he or she must be available for and seeking work for the period in which he or she is not employed.

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy on one-parent family payment is to encourage and facilitate lone parents in moving into the paid labour force so that they may avoid long-term welfare dependency. The main element of this policy is an earnings disregard of &euro;146.50 per week. This disregard is designed to help towards expenses incurred from taking up employment such as travel, child minding etc. In addition, only half of any earnings above this threshold are assessed as means, up to the maximum earnings of &euro;293.00 per week. In the case of the person concerned, as her earnings will exceed the disregard of &euro;146.50, her one parent family payment rate would be reduced. On the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy, the person concerned would have a reduction of the order of &euro;15 on her weekly payment.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?><P>Rent supplements are provided for under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Supplementary welfare allowance is payable to people on community employment, subject to the standard means test. Under standard assessment rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Up to &euro;60 in respect of additional income from part-time employment is disregarded in the means test, thus ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. Community employment is regarded as part-time employment for these purposes.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>On the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy, the person concerned would have a reduction in rent supplement of the order of &euro;115 per week. Taking this and the reduction in her one-parent family payment into account, she would be &euro;60 per week better off overall if she takes up the CE place.</P>
        <P>The current eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the SWA scheme, are designed to ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up employment opportunities, and that there is a safeguard in place to provide rent supplement in any exceptional hardship that may arise. The effectiveness of these arrangements will be considered further in the context of a review of the <Col N="986"/>supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which my Department is undertaking during 2005.</P>

	<P>In my reply to previous parliamentary questions from the Deputy on 26 January 2005 on this case, I informed him that the Health Service Executive had advised that the rent supplement in payment to the person concerned was due for review to take account of the fact that she had begun a second year of her community employment scheme. This was necessary because her entitlement to rent supplement derived from the rules governing retention of the payment for people on community employment schemes. Those rules provide that a person may retain 75% of their payment for one year and 50% in the following year.</P>
        <P>This review has been completed. The level of her household income now exceeds the &euro;317.43 limit which allows people on approved employment schemes to retain a portion of their rent supplement on a tapered basis. Nonetheless, as a community employment participant the person concerned is entitled to be assessed for rent supplement under standard supplementary welfare allowance rules.</P>
        <P>The executive has informed my Department that, on further examination of the case, it has found that amount of rent supplement issued to the person concerned in respect of February 2005 was incorrectly calculated. Under the standard assessment rules which should have applied in her case, she is entitled to a monthly rent supplement of &euro;322.50. A higher amount was issued to her in error. The executive is arranging to contact the person concerned to ensure that the correct amount of supplement is paid to her in future while her community employment continues. Her rent supplement will be further reviewed when that employment ceases in due course.</P>

        <P>Park and ride facilities are an element of the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, transport strategy 2000 to 2016, A Platform for Change. There are two main types of park and ride facilities, bus-based, where scheduled bus services operate from purpose built car parks, and rail-based, where parking at rail stations can effectively widen the catchment of the rail services. There are currently a total of 576 parking spaces in the areas outlined by the Deputy. The DTO working group on rail-based park and ride, consisting of DTO, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, RPA and GDA local authorities, produced a strategy for the development of rail-based park and ride facilities in the GDA in November 2004.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the need to have adequate park and ride facilities in order to facilitate the modal shift from car use to the use of public transport. I am considering the findings and recommendations made in this strategy, which includes a recommendation for the provision of additional or enhanced parking facilities at various stations. I will address this matter in consultation with the relevant authorities.</P>

Permission to lease the entire quota can be granted only where the applicant is unable to deliver milk due to <i>force majeure,</i> or in other duly justified cases, temporarily affecting production capacity. Notwithstanding that the <Col N="988"/>application was late, it was assessed but based on the information provided the application was not successful.

	<P>The flockowners in question were depopulated during the initial scrapie depopulation regime. In total, some 100 flocks were depopulated under this phase and restocking was not permitted for a period of two years. Flockowners received compensation for the capital value of the sheep and for income loss for that period. In addition, those who restocked in the third year also received compensation for income loss for that year. The terms of the agreement and amounts of compensation and income loss involved were clearly understood and accepted by all concerned at the time of depopulation. Further compensation in respect of later years was not part of this agreement. While a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Crosby examined costs associated with restocking, no undertaking was given by my Department in relation to the findings of that committee.</P>

	<P>I understand that an application for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme was submitted by the group to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform some time ago. The programme is a seven-year development programme that aims to increase the availability and <Col N="991"/>quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>As there is a high level of demand for capital grant assistance, I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the current programme. Following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available for the period between 2005 and 2009, in the context of the 2005 budget. Some &euro;50 million is being made available under the current programme and &euro;40 million will be made available under the next phase of the child care programme after 2006. The funds augment the increased EU funding of &euro;12 million made available last year in recognition of the programme&rsquo;s progress. That brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;499.3 million and includes an increased provision for capital developments, for which &euro;205 million has been set aside.</P>
        <P>In December 2004, I announced an allocation of almost &euro;35 million in capital funding to community-based and not-for-profit groups. The availability of the additional funding will enable me to make further capital grant assistance available in the coming months and years to groups which address significant child care service gaps, if the project proposal represents good value for money when considered in the context of building cost guidelines. In that light, the group in question has been advised that while its project was not prioritised for immediate funding in December 2004, it will be reconsidered in the future. It was informed that I hope to make further significant capital commitments in 2005 and thereafter.</P>
        <P>The ongoing assessment of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity. When the assessment of the project in question is completed, the application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, which is chaired by the Department of Agriculture and Food, before I make a final decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on the application.</P>

        <P>The EOCP 2000-2006 is a demand-led grant programme with a total budget of &euro;499 million over the period of the national development plan. My Department first called for applications in April 2000 and continues to accept applications from child care providers across the country.</P>
        <P>The EOCP 2000-2006 makes available capital and staffing funding for community-based or not-for-profit child care services. Also, the EOCP 2000-2006 introduced a capital grant for private sector child care providers which provides a maximum of &euro;50,790 for building work to or equipment for a privately operated child care service. Further funding is provided to develop the capacity of the child care sector. This includes annual funding for city and county child care <Col N="995"/>committees which have a role in supporting child care actions at local level.</P>
        <P>I understand that, under the EOCP 2000-2006, my Department has already made &euro;257.3 million available in capital and staffing grant assistance to child care services nationwide between the launch of the programme in 2000 and the end of 2004.</P>
        <P>Of this total, &euro;25.4 million was provided to private sector child care services in the form of capital grants. A total of &euro;127.6 million in capital grant assistance and &euro;104.2 million in staffing grant assistance was provided to community-based and voluntary child care services.</P>
        <P>Staffing grant assistance is normally approved for a three year period and much of the remaining current funding is required for ongoing supports to groups providing child care services to disadvantaged families to enable them to participate in employment, education and training opportunities.</P>
        <P>In respect of County Laois, I understand that, under the EOCP 2000-2006, &euro;4.6 million was made available to child care services over the same period. Private sector child care services in County Laois had &euro;700,000 made available in the form of capital grants. A total of &euro;2.2 million in capital grants and &euro;1.7 million in staffing grant assistance has been made available to community-based and voluntary child care services.</P>
        <P>It may interest the Deputy to know that my colleague the Minister for Finance announced additional capital funding for child care in the budget for 2005. This announcement increased the funding available to my Department for child care to &euro;499 million over the life of the national development plan. The funding announced also provided a further &euro;40 million of capital funding for the period from the end of the national development plan to 2009.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question arises in the context of the acknowledgement of correspondence issued by my Department on 24 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The correspondence in question comprises five pages and deals with a dispute which the person in question is having with the Revenue Commissioners, the circumstances giving rise to that dispute and the extent to which the conduct of the Revenue Commissioners have impinged upon his constitutional rights. For this reason it was not immediately apparent in my Department that its sole purpose was in connection with his naturalisation application.</P>
        <P>As a consequence a degree of intermediate intervention was required prior to its transmission to the citizenship division of my Department. When the reply to the question to which the Deputy refers was prepared the letter had not been received in the citizenship section, although it has now been received and placed on the relevant case file.</P>
        <P>As I have already informed the Deputy in response to an earlier question, the average processing time for an application for naturalisation is 24 months. It is likely, therefore, that the applications of the persons referred to will be finalised by mid-2006. There are almost 4,000 applications awaiting processing before the applications of the persons in question and I do not consider that there are any exceptional circumstances disclosed in the applications concerned why they should be expedited at this point in time.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that the absence of confirmation from the Revenue Commissioners that the persons&rsquo; tax affairs were in order has impeded the processing of the files, however, it will ensure that when processing begins all of the relevant information is in place.</P>

        <P>In November 2004, a declaration of acceptance of Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship was lodged with the citizenship section of my Department.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary schools&rsquo; running costs are met by my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The capitation grant for primary schools has been increased substantially in <Col N="999"/>recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45, &euro;57.14, per pupil to &euro;121.58 with effect from 1 January 2004 and is being increased by a further &euro;12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2005 bringing the standard rate to &euro;133.58. This represents an increase of almost 134% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.</P>
        <P>There have also been significant improvements in the level of funding for second level schools. The standard <i>per capita</i> grant now amounts to &euro;286 as against the rate of &euro;224.74 that applied in 1997. This increase will bring the <i>per capita </i>grant in the case of disadvantaged schools to &euro;324 per pupil. In addition, under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant. This grant, which was introduced in September 2000, has been increased from &euro;25 per pupil to &euro;103 from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support grant has in the case of voluntary secondary schools been significantly enhanced to &euro;145 per pupil from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>These increases are in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of my Department. It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from my Department.</P>
        <P>It would not be feasible for my Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as charges for waste recycling.</P>

	<P>The Government decided last July that my Department should finalise contractual negotiations with Jarvis Projects Limited with the view <Col N="1000"/>to commencing construction of the Cork School of Music as soon as practical. Shortly thereafter Jarvis Plc, preferred bidder for the project, announced a profit warning on the London Stock Exchange. To help solve its financial difficulties the company commenced selling off non-core elements of the company. One of the areas to be disposed of was the public private partnership-PFI bidding business and on 3 December 2004 Jarvis announced that it had reached an agreement with Hochtief Developments (UK) Ltd.</P>
        <P>Following the announcement, various issues surrounding the purchase were being completed and a revised proposal and documentation in connection with the Cork School of Music public private partnership project were received on 19 January 2005. As Hochtief has replaced Jarvis as a member of the bidding consortium it must satisfy the Department that had it applied under the terms of the original public private partnership advertised in 2000 it would have been one of the consortia that pre-qualified for the project.</P>
        <P>The new documentation is being examined by my Department&rsquo;s specialist advisers to the project who are also undertaking full financial and legal due diligence to ensure that the proposal meets all EU procurement guidelines. It is expected that this examination will be completed and a report submitted to my Department&rsquo;s public private partnership unit for consideration shortly.</P>
        <P>Subject to all of the necessary financial and legal issues being in order it will then be possible to commence formal negotiations with Hochtief Developments to complete the contract details to allow financial and commercial close for the project take place.</P>

This system also applies to those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in regard to the proposed model for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, my Department is currently reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs.

	<P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of one shared learning support teacher and a shared resource teacher. I trust that the Deputy is aware of the proposed new system for resource teacher allocation which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. This system also applies to those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the proposed model for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, my Department is currently reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests, including the NCSE, before it is implemented in September 2005.</P>

	<P>An extension project at the school to which the Deputy refers has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, and the project is being considered in the context of the school buildings and modernisation programme. The Deputy will be aware that in January I announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005.</P>
        <P>I have today announced the next phase of the programme under which 192 schools will be allocated funding to undertake projects, such as extensions and refurbishments. These projects will proceed immediately, on a devolved basis, which means that the school authorities will control the planning and construction phases of the improvement works at their own school. Each school will be contacted directly by officials, over the next few days.</P><Col N="1004"/>
        <P>Further phases of the school building and modernisation programme are nearing finalisation and I will be making further announcements in the coming weeks to include an expansion of the number of schools and extending the scope of the projects approved under the summer works scheme, schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning and schools whose projects will further progress through the design process.</P>

	<P>Financial assistance for the purpose indicated is not provided by my Department. The determination of waste charges is statutorily a matter for the relevant local authority in cases where it acts as the service provider. Where, as commonly occurs, a private operator acts as a service provider then that operator will determine the charges. With a view to facilitating increased recycling of waste, my Department has already provided significant capital grant assistance from the environment fund to local authorities towards the provision of recycling and recovery facilities. Funding is also being provided on an ongoing basis towards meeting the current operating costs of such facilities.</P>

	<P>The development and prioritisation of water services infrastructural proposals for inclusion in the water services investment programme is, in the first instance, the responsibility of local authorities. I understand an extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to Swinford was included as a post-2006 requirement in the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by Mayo County Council in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to local authorities in 2003 to produce updated assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. These assessments were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2004-2006 published by my Department in May 2004. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council, it was not possible to include it in the current programme.</P>

	<P>The site was discovered during the course of archaeological investigations in advance of the construction of the N25 &mdash; Waterford city bypass which were being carried out on behalf of Waterford City Council under the auspices of the NRA. A report on the outcome of these archaeological investigations which identified a previously unknown Viking site was submitted to my Department and is available on the NRA website. Subsequently my Department issued directions under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2004 requiring further studies to be carried out by the road developers to establish the archaeological potential of a marsh area at the western end of the site; the reports on the results of these additional <Col N="1008"/>investigations have now been submitted. The road developers have indicated that an alternative route which would avoid the site is feasible and is now their preferred option.</P>
        <P>I have recently visited the Viking site at Woodstown and indicated that I am minded, subject to the statutory procedures, to direct its preservation pending the development of proposals for future archaeological investigation. Under the legislation I am obliged to consult with the Director of the National Museum before directions are issued as to how the site should be dealt with from an archaeological point of view. I would hope to initiate consultations with the director within the next week, and have these finalised soon, at which stage directions can be issued. </P>
