      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The total projected cost of the communications unit to date in 2005 is &euro;239,951. The sum of &euro;96,938 is a direct cost to my Department, with on average &euro;32,475 being borne by the five other Departments with staff seconded to the unit. The total projected cost of the unit for 2005 is &euro;319,934, with &euro;129,250 being a direct cost to my Department. The total cost of the communications unit since 2002, which includes a projected cost for 2005, is &euro;1,085,300.</P>
        <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure Departments are kept informed in a quick and <Col N="1454"/>efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
        <P>The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensure they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. The communications unit is estimated to save Departments in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a long day to be giving bad news. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s normal defence of the unit is that it replaces use by Departments of commercial transcript-providing companies. Is the Taoiseach satisfied that no Department continues to get transcripts of media programmes and interviews on a commercial basis?</P>
        <P>Last May the Taoiseach said it was estimated the communications unit saved Departments in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum, yet it will cost &euro;319,000 to run the unit this year. Does the Taoiseach consider that to be good value?</P>
        <P>The last time we discussed this matter the Taoiseach extended an invitation to Deputy Rabbitte and me to see the communications unit for ourselves. If there is a possibility that we might have to examine the unit, is the invitation still open?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always happy to show Deputies the good services provided by my Department. If other Departments are using transcripts for programmes available from the communications unit, they should not be. I am not certain that none of them is but there is no reason they should, although the unit does not cover local programmes. Of the staff in the unit, 90% are from other Departments so they know transcripts are available.</P>
        <P>The figure for savings has been used for the past seven or eight years since the service started. If it were to be estimated now, it would be much higher. The unit gives a good service and good value. It is not just a service to Ministers but to several hundred people who get updates every hour of every day. It is a useful service provided by a small number of people and produces savings equal to the salaries and allowances paid to staff it. It is a Civil Service unit, not a political one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the performance of this unit? He says its central purpose is to keep Ministers informed. A pattern has emerged in recent times whereby if anything controversial is discussed in this House, the only thing one can be certain of is that Ministers will claim not to have been informed. Might this unit <Col N="1455"/>fill the vacuum in the memories and knowledge of line Ministers who should be aware of things going awry in their Department and who, even when information appears in the press, still do not know about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy knows the unit deals with issues of the day that are in the public domain. It cannot do any more than that. It is not a political unit and cannot forewarn or advise Ministers or their officials in advance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Given that the communications unit is staffed by established civil servants and provides a news monitoring service to a range of Ministers and Departments other than the Taoiseach&rsquo;s, will he not accede to the repeated requests of Deputies that the service be made available in the Oireachtas Library so that all Members of this House can have access to the information provided? Given that it is paid for by taxpayers, does he not believe that the media summaries and updates of news reports should also be put on the internal Oireachtas website as a resource for Members?</P>
        <P>Failing that, does the Taoiseach agree that the information should be made available on request from the communications unit? If the answer to any or all of these questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, will he explain why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Data prepared by civil servants in their normal course of work are not made available to Members of the House and this case is no different. The information provide by the communications unit is a summary of daily news bulletins. Members may access this information themselves. The advantage of this is that transcripts and other information are available; that is the service that is provided to Departments rather than having them deal with commercial organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to note how much Civil Service time, energy and resources have been invested in the communications unit, yet freedom of information legislation has been amended to frustrate the accessing of information that may otherwise be &mdash; and should be &mdash; available. Is there not merit in the opinion that this is less of a communications unit and more of a propaganda unit which is doing the business of Government, instead of providing an objective service available to all sides of the House and the Oireachtas in general?</P>
        <P Just="Left">From a legal point of view I would argue that there is an obligation on the communications unit to be available more widely than just to the Government and to the people working on its behalf who were mentioned by the Taoiseach. Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with the <Col N="1456"/>Attorney General on this issue and does a case have to be answered on the availability of information from the communications unit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy is suggesting that a summary of what is contained in the morning newspapers and on radio equates to propaganda, I am not sure who benefits from this propaganda. That is a point of view worth debating. This unit points out what is in the newspaper and radio headlines.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are six special advisers appointed by me and there has been no increase in their number since I took office. Under the direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government. They are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters and performing other such functions as may be directed by me from time to time.</P>
        <P>Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers. My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities. They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government. In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities with regard to speech drafting. My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis. He monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1457"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Are there guidelines for the work of the six special advisers in the Taoiseach's Department and, if so, do such guidelines apply to other Departments? When a special adviser is appointed, does he or she get a list of regulations or conditions that he or she must abide by? How is the monitoring function of the special advisers implemented? Do the advisers visit other Departments to see if the programme for Government is being put in place?</P>
        <P>On advisers liaising with special interest groups, does one of the six advisers liaise with the group of Independent Deputies in the House, just in case the Taoiseach needs them at some time in the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The advisers are governed by the Public Services Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. They are governed by ethics legislation from 1995 and 2004 and they also have written contracts. Difficulties occurred some years ago and procedure was tightened as a result. Advisers in other Departments are also governed by these measures. Each year these people must fill in a full range of forms declaring any interests and send them to the ethics commission. They do not tend to go to meetings in other Departments when meetings are held in Government buildings, but they meet on a weekly basis with the advisers from other Departments. None of those mentioned is involved with the independents. An official from the Whip&rsquo;s office meets them from time to time, but that was more relevant to the last Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Are individual political advisers assigned particular policy areas? Do any of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s political advisers have a sole, focused responsibility for health, or for the peace process, or for international affairs? Does the Taoiseach agree that it would be better if such a focused approach existed? In that way, attention to key areas that reflect poorly on this Government would help to ensure that matters moved forward expeditiously in the interests not only of the Government, but more importantly, of the wider electorate.</P>
        <P>What system of accountability exists for these advisers? How are they assessed in their stewardship or in their value for public money, other than for the project of the next general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The advisers are focused on individual areas. They do not duplicate effort and are designated to individual Departments because that is the sensible way to do things. Some work on foreign affairs issues, on Northern Ireland issues or on health or education issues and they liaise with people in those Departments. The Deputy&rsquo;s view is that some of these areas are not well run. I am glad to see, however, that the IMF stated today that the country is doing well <Col N="1458"/>because of the success of Government policies. The Deputy obviously disagrees, but he is entitled to that view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that there are 13 employees in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s private office and eight in his constituency office, under the general term of advisers or staff. Can the Taoiseach clarify the breakdown, if it exists, between Civil Service positions and appointees from outside the Civil Service in that number? What pay scale is being followed for these staff? Is it totally separate from anything in the Civil Service? I have seen salaries of &euro;192,784 and &euro;144,064. Is that scale benchmarked against any other performance, or is it unique to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I listed the individuals and their salary scales in the answer to the original question. The special advisers are linked to Civil Service grades. The Department of Finance set these scales when the advisers are taken on. My programme manager is allowed a top-up, but all the salaries are linked to Civil Service or Department of Finance scales, such as assistant principal and principal officer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the breakdown between appointees and civil servants?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>None of the six appointees is a civil servant. They all must leave when I leave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I read that one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s people concerned was recently decorated by the French Government. If that is true, I extend my congratulations.</P>
        <P>He clearly thinks this policy brings a valuable dimension to governance. The way things are going, I agree with him. It brings a valuable dimension and I am happy we are agreed on that. However, does he think the idea should be extended? For example, what is his view about recruiting senior managers in the private sector for certain jobs, not just in his own Department but in the Civil Service generally?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Secretary General in my Department made a speech about that over the weekend. He put forward the circumstances and the case as to how it could be done on the basis of public service reform. I had a chance to read half of his speech. As far as bringing in expertise from the private sector is concerned, he made the point that while it has been carried out in a limited way for many years and a small number of people have been recruited, it has not been done in any major way. As many recent reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General have revealed, expertise is lacking in many areas of the public service. There have been many arguments about consultants and advisers but he made the <Col N="1459"/>case that the public service does not have the expertise. The Secretary General argued that in some cases, there are areas to which outside expertise should perhaps be introduced.</P>
        <P>My view is that one could do so and it might be even argued that in certain areas, it might be cheaper than hiring outside companies. However, I do not believe that top class experts in some areas could be secured cheaply. There are always arguments about benchmarking between the public and private sectors, when one considers the various grades. However, one should examine the salaries of financial specialists working in Dublin and compare their earnings to the salary of an Accounting Officer. Deputy Rabbitte is aware that people working in the top stock market houses or who manage funds in the IFSC earn salaries that seem extraordinary to the Deputy, to myself or to anyone else in this House. I am well remunerated for my job, but none of these people would do my job for the salary I receive and the best of luck to them.</P>
        <P>Therefore, I do not believe it would be easy to recruit top class experts. One could recruit people into the middle ranks, but it would not be easy. How would ten high level people arriving with enormously large salaries fit in with others in the public service? Nevertheless, an argument exists and it is an argument against the costs of consultants. Public servants feel aggrieved from time to time, much as they admire the expertise of consultants, when they see the rates being charged, possibly not to the individuals but to the companies. This area also requires some examination. The Secretary General of my Department, who has been an eminent public servant for many decades, has made the point that there are arguments to be considered as part of strategic management and public performance management. I do not discount his view that there are areas which should be examined. He has not come to this view recently but has been articulating it for the last decade or more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When the time comes for Members to pay tribute to the Taoiseach, undoubtedly Members from all sides of the House will have to compliment him on his unremitting courtesy to the House, even in the face of provocation. Hence, I do not mean to be rude by stating that I know what his Secretary General&rsquo;s view is as I have read the speech. I am asking the Taoiseach for his view. Does he agree with the recruitment of outside people to managerial posts in the Civil Service, or may I draw the inference that the question of salary is the only obstacle? It has been a pattern and we cannot have it both ways. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Ministers continually run away from any decisions that go wrong. They have a quango, an organisation, a civil servant or something else to blame. They seem to take the <Col N="1460"/>attitude that such problems were caused by operational decisions that should have been taken by civil servants. Perhaps we need more skilled managers. I am trying to establish the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view of this matter as I know the Secretary General&rsquo;s view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was trying to balance my comments. There are many morale and industrial relations issues throughout the public service. Deputy Rabbitte and I have both spent much time dealing with the service in one way or another. I know the system and how its members other than the top 1% think.</P>
        <P>It would be difficult to implement what the Deputy suggests. Exchanges take place at present, in which people come into the system from a commercial company for a period, which is not the same as advertising the number two post in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outsiders, for example. For those who work hard in the system and do their best at executive officer, higher executive officer, staff officer, assistant principal officer and principal officer levels, what happens to their morale when they reach 52 or 53 years of age after serving committees of the Oireachtas and the public service and undertaking evening degrees, which many do, only to have someone from outside come in? It is a significant dilemma.</P>
        <P>To get a person comparable to someone who, by that stage, has 25 years of public service experience and a large amount of knowledge in dealing with Brussels, Luxembourg and so on, would not be cheap for the system. If this person entered at a very high level, what would happen <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other levels and assistant secretaries in other Departments? My honest opinion is that this seems a grandiose proposal to table but I do not know how it could work. I have spent many years working with civil servants on the old relativity claims, equity claims and others and can foresee a nightmare of arguments against this move. On the other side of the argument is the cost because we do not have the expertise.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I have answered in writing a number of parliamentary questions on a certain issue. If one were to take my Department, which is relatively small, as an example, there are eight people doing postgraduate studies and a total of 33 at university level who get some assistance from the State&rsquo;s taxpayers this year. I welcome this activity as we should help them in their training and knowledge. This is a fair way of achieving something. It is not simply a case of advertising and bringing people in at the top levels. The Deputy has asked for my view as Taoiseach and someone who has watched the system. This proposal is easily put forward but I have difficulty believing it would work in the public service.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1461"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in what the Taoiseach has said. However, is it not reasonable to draw the conclusion that the reason we have such frequent resort to outside consultants is that we do not have the in-house capacity or knowledge? The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a report on this matter four to six years ago or longer in which he examined the service. There have been some very stark examples in recent times. Is this because we do not have the in-house capacity or is there a fear in the modern Civil Service in that, owing to the nature of public affairs today or whatever reason, civil servants are afraid to make decisions on certain matters without the cover of a consultant&rsquo;s report, so that even a relatively straightforward matter will not go up the line or reach the Minister&rsquo;s desk unless it instances one of the top five consultants claiming the idea put forward is good? I draw from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer &mdash; he can tell me whether I am correct &mdash; that he has thought about this and has concluded the implications for IR and staff morale are such that he does not see how we can easily do it. A crying need exists for this type of expertise and resorting to consultants is an extremely expensive way of achieving it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s analysis. It is a fact that we do not have the expertise in certain areas, sectors and disciplines. That is undoubtedly true. We saw recently that in IT we do not have the type of expertise that can design a system afresh. I am sure Members of the House are aware that in the private sector, developing and enhancing the quality and content of what a system will deliver is an enormously well-resourced job.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We use consultants in these areas because expecting existing members of staff to do their regular jobs and then do a little work on enhancing a system would not be possible. While they are capable of designing complicated systems, the resources are not available. For many years the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that we do not have the expertise in many areas. I have no doubt he would consider this one such area. It is not easy to introduce that expertise. One could create specialist appointments, which has been done before. A grade could be created whereby if a person entered in that grade he or she could not move out of it. Ringfencing the position would avoid some of the IR problems. A person would enter as an expert in a particular area and that would save some money on some consultancy fees.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point on whether public servants are afraid to act or make a decision, we are lucky to have honest, efficient public servants who are able to carry out their roles. This House has changed dramatically during the past decade, as has the country. Public servants are now subject <Col N="1462"/>to the rigours of parliamentary democracy, accountability and scrutiny and are answerable for the enormous amount of money, approximately &euro;42 billion, being spent.</P>
        <P>It is in people&rsquo;s nature to make the best possible decisions. As we have seen during the past few years, when things go wrong they and the Government get it in the neck. However, while it is a fact that people are more careful and cautious, that is not the primary reason for it. Decisions have become far more complex. In many situations involving State contracts, public servants deal with outside agencies and sophisticated companies with vast resources, expertise and specialists. They deal with experienced professional people on matters such as procurement and cost structures and they must be careful. In terms of contracts for roads and rail, for example, public servants have to deal with professionals from companies which have vast resources and expertise and specialists.</P>
        <P>Most of the Irish professional procurement agencies are linked to international offices. Increasingly when I chair the cross-departmental team on infrastructure, I see companies bringing with them gurus who have completed megabuck contracts from Spain, France or Germany. Our public servants must deal with these people and it is not easy. To ensure they get it right they seek whatever advice they can. That is in the ethos of people trying to do their best. They do it to protect not themselves, but the Departments and finances, and they do it in as sophisticated a way as possible. Their attitude is not that they will not make a decision in order to avoid making a mistake.</P>

	<P>What lessons would the Taoiseach draw, for example, from the apparent success of the National Treasury Management Agency?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should please confine himself to the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach asked me what I was referring to. I was just explaining that it was the National Treasury Management Agency, which was established initially to manage the national debt. It has acquired a number of very important areas since then. Even insurance was added when we got into difficulties in that area. Now, the new development finance agency involving certain dimensions of infrastructural projects for the future is included and so on. Is it because the NTMA is free to employ top-flight personnel at the market rate and, therefore, we can entrust tasks to it that could not be done within the Civil Service any longer? If that is the conclusion, it seems to me to have certain implications for this debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1463"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Treasury Management Agency commenced its operations when I was Minister for Finance, when the national debt/GNP ratio was frightening to say the least. The resources of the State were being gobbled up, as the Deputy knows, and matters had to be managed in another way. What the Deputy said is correct. We were able to use top-class people who not only had previous experience but had reached the top commercially as regards the management of debt, re-financing, the gilts markets etc. These were people with long experience in those areas who were able to build a significant team.</P>
        <P>One of the major problems when the economy improved in the last decade was how to hold on to people. Even though the NTMA was paying significantly more than the normal Civil Service rates, it was not able to match market rates and some of its best and brightest young people &mdash; many of them from the public service and the Department of Finance &mdash; were attracted to the private sector.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, the NTMA had the flexibility to cope, as it did with the new claims agency, public private partnerships and the new roles created for it by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. It was able to bring in expertise, to get legal, insurance and other professional advice on a buy-in basis and have access to actuarial and process maintenance consultants in a way that a Government Department could not. Because it possessed such a degree of flexibility and streamlining, the NTMA was given these responsibilities. It is not subject to the same strictures as Departments in the Civil Service, which has given it the necessary freedom to do the job it does.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 13, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The interdepartmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs has met eight times this year and is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday, 9 November. The team generally meets on a monthly basis and is scheduled to have one more meeting in the remainder of 2005. While the agenda for the November meeting has yet to be finalised, it will include updates on wider energy policy issues and on the national spatial strategy gateways study.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, the team monitors progress and reviews priorities under the various NDP infrastructure headings. It looks at options to secure better value for money outcomes and assesses the scope for the speedier delivery of outputs. The team produces an annual report which is laid before the House. This report provides an overview of progress during the previous year within the main policy frameworks and in the physical delivery of projects.</P>
        <P>As I have told the House previously, the team serves a valuable role in progressing and resolving issues related to infrastructure planning and delivery and will continue to make an important contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There are only a few minutes left, so I will ask these questions directly. Last year in the budget the exemption threshold for stamp duty was set at &euro;315,000. Recent statistics indicate that the average cost of a new house in Dublin is &euro;346,000 and nationally, the price of a second-hand house is &euro;332,000, both of which are above the stamp duty threshold. Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s belief that this should be adjusted?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently announced a new raft of primary and post-primary schools to be built under the public private partnership system. Did the cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public private partnerships consider the further use of PPPs before the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, which was welcome for the schools in question? The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report stated the projected cost of final PPP deals was 8% to 13% higher than the projected cost of building and running schools using the conventional approach. Did the team consider this statement?</P><Col N="1465"/>
        <P>Does the Government share the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view in respect of supertrucks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be kept out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Forty-two people have been killed by articulated trucks on the roads this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is moving beyond the scope of the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin Port tunnel is a major piece of infrastructure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but the Deputy&rsquo;s question is well outside the scope of the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem is that the trucks cannot get inside, never mind outside, the tunnel.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have to find another way of raising the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it the view of the Government that supertrucks should not be allowed here?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise on this group of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach take into account comments by the chief of the Irish Road Haulage Association in respect of additional trucks, increased pollution, more costs and so forth? Is it true that &euro;4.6 million has been spent solely on Luas smart cards which cannot be used under any other system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s questions do not arise on this group of questions and should be addressed directly to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The cross-departmental team on infrastructure and public-private partnerships, which was involved in the Luas project, should have taken into account a fundamental issue, namely, the use of smart cards on the Luas system on which a sum of &euro;4.6 million of our money was spent. I want to know whether the cross-departmental team ever considered this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is taking up the time of the House in moving beyond the scope of the questions. I ask the Taoiseach to reply to the relevant questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure what point the Ceann Comhairle is coming from but these issues are directly related to the cross-departmental team function.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1466"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I am coming from is that the Taoiseach is taking five questions together and the supplementary questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not responsible for that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the Deputy is responsible for his supplementary questions which should be specifically related to the questions in the group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am more entitled to ask questions than any other party leader who has tabled questions. I have asked five questions and will probably not get answers to any of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions on Departments should be addressed directly to the relevant line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The thrust of my questions related to cross-departmental teams on infrastructure and public-private partnerships.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s questions quickly. On the last issue, it is policy to try to have interchangeability in transport. The aim is to move to having one card which can be used on everything. That is what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P>In relation to stamp duty, thankfully this year the attractions of the stamp duty exemption, particularly for new house owners, has led to more young people, particularly first-time mortgagees, choosing to buy second-hand houses. This has had the corresponding effect that in some areas second-hand house prices have gone up because demand for them has gone up. The question as to whether any changes will be introduced is a matter for the Minister for Finance every year. He made significant changes last year so I do not think it will be a priority this year. We have not had any discussion on the issue.</P>
        <P>On the issue of infrastructure for trucks and so on, many countries ban the trucks to which the Deputy referred. They are part of an effort by hauliers in these countries to have fewer people working for them and bigger trucks. That is what this is about and the state of the roads will get a hammering if they can have their supertrucks. Supertrucks are not necessary in this country and there is no pressure to bring them in other than from people who want to improve their own profitability on the roads. The Deputy asked another specific question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the cross-departmental team consider the new public-private partnerships for schools in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1467"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, we had a lot of discussion on this issue. The new initiative is aimed at accelerating delivery of PPPs for key infrastructural projects in central Government areas. The new centre of expertise will be located in the National Development Finance Agency. Its role will be expanded to include the procurement function on behalf of Departments in addition to its existing role as adviser to Departments on PPPs. The agency has commenced this new activity on an interim basis pending the introduction of enabling legislation.</P>
        <P>The centre will provide the skills and capacity to support the procurement of key infrastructure in Departments. It will concentrate initially on three: the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The recent example Deputy Kenny mentioned is the 23 new post-primary schools and the four primary schools under public-private partnership. There are many issues in this. They will be taken in bundles of five or six and can be done speedily. There are issues of maintenance and efficiencies. In many of these cases the schools are for 800 or 1,000 pupils in growing new areas. The PPP system is seen as being speedy and efficient and giving value.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an added cost. I have stated on many occasions there is no doubt that in the normal course of events the cheapest way to borrow money is for the State to do it. That will always be the way, except where the State is not in a position to borrow money at all. However, there are several areas, particularly with big projects where private sector involvement enables us to get them done efficiently and one can get quality of design and procurement procedures. The private sector has taken a number of these projects and is building them. There is not an argument for doing this everywhere but in projects like these there is an argument.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive is advancing the implementation of a series of measures to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services. These measures take a wide ranging approach and are aimed at improving access to accident and emergency services, <Col N="1468"/>improving patient flows through accident and emergency departments, freeing up acute beds and providing appropriate longer term care for patients outside of the acute hospital setting.</P>
        <P>A particular focus has been placed on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The HSE is making sustained efforts to arrange for the discharge of these patients to have more acute beds available in hospital for emergency patients. High dependency beds and intermediate care beds in private nursing homes along with home care packages are being used to ensure that patients are appropriately placed. The number of delayed discharges in the major Dublin hospitals now stands at 378. This is the lowest number since January 2005 and has been achieved as a result of the various measures implemented to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also advised me that there was a reduction of 22% in the total numbers waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency departments between April 2005 and September 2005. The reduction in Dublin hospitals has been 25%.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE will continue to work closely to maintain a focus on the implementation of system-wide measures to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There was a danger for some time that the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten point accident and emergency plan would turn into a ten year plan. I am glad she has focused her attentions on the nub of the problem in the accident and emergency departments in the greater Dublin region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Her reply did not refer to MRI scanners and everything else that went into this ten point plan, but mentioned that she has focused on the problem, that is, looking after those 400 patients who are taking up beds inappropriately in the acute hospitals.</P>
        <P>I want more detail on what she means because this looks at long-term care, both low and high-dependency level care for these patients. What plans has she for a community care nursing home setting, hopefully run in the public sector in the greater Dublin region and how will she look at that problem in the future? There may be 400 patients in these Dublin hospitals now &mdash; the figure has always been between 400 and 500 &mdash; but what is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s plan for the future, especially when we have an older population? The matter of how badly this job has been done by Government has cropped up in many parliamentary questions in recent times. For example, the health strategy promised community care support and extended care beds at a rate of 800 per year. To date, since 2001, only 531 of these beds have been delivered &mdash; less than 10%. During those years, the former Minister for Health and Children and the Ministers of State, <Col N="1469"/>Deputies Martin and Callely, continued to answer questions on the issue by saying what a great job they were doing in delivering these beds. However, less than 10% of the expected beds have been delivered. I ask the T&aacute;naiste for a clear answer on how we will develop community care nursing home beds in the public system for the greater Dublin region, both now and into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 92 mainly concerns the issue of accident and emergency units, a matter that has been a priority for me. We have worked successfully on initiatives that will have a lasting and not just a temporary impact. That is the reason the number of patients on trolleys is down by 25% in Dublin and 22% nationally since last April.</P>
        <P>With regard to the elderly &mdash; on which a parliamentary question arises later &mdash; there have been significant initiatives. I will announce further initiatives later this year, many of which will support people to remain in their homes. Families with support are more inclined to support their elderly in the community than is the case if there is no support. Elderly people prefer this. International research shows that people live two years longer on average and have a higher quality of life if they can live at home. I will deal with the Deputy&rsquo;s question by way of the later question.</P>
        <P>One of the big issues in the Dublin area is the lack of out-of-hours services for general practitioners. We have gone to tender on the north side of Dublin in this regard. I understand four companies have submitted tenders to provide these services. This initiative will have a major impact, in particular on Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the reason a patient was sent from Dublin to Limerick by taxi at a rate of &euro;600 for minor eye surgery under the national treatment purchase fund while other patients have been denied access to treatment by private hospitals due to the fact that the hospitals had been informed that the national treatment purchase fund has filled its quota of patients for the year 2005; the steps she will take to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor General requests a full review of the national treatment fund in 2005 to assess whether it is providing value for money; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29481/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>In its service plan for 2005 the national treatment purchase fund set a target of having treatment arranged for 16,000 patients. Up to the end of September a total of 12,000 <Col N="1470"/>patients were treated. Under the fund more than 35,000 patients have been treated to date and waiting times have been significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>The majority of these patients have had their treatment provided in private hospitals in Ireland. The NTPF is working closely with private hospitals to identify and locate the necessary capacity to have patients treated while at the same time managing the number of treatments being provided in order to reach its target for 2005. My Department has been informed by the NTPF that patients have not been denied access to treatment in private hospitals. There is no reason any patient should have been turned away. All surgery planned to the end of the year is set to go ahead.</P>
        <P>With regard to the transport of patients, I remind the Deputy that the policy of the NTPF is to provide transport for patients where it is deemed medically necessary or where there are people with special needs, for example the elderly or the infirm. In the case to which the Deputy refers, the procedure involved was not minor eye surgery as it required the patient to have a general anaesthetic and to stay overnight in hospital. Transport was decided having regard to patient safety and best medical practice. There was no taxi fare of &euro;600.</P>
        <P>In general, the number of patients that require transport is small and the cost of taxis to the NTPF last year was under &euro;4 per patient treated. In the case of a patient going abroad for treatment the travel costs are paid for by the fund. The authorisation of transport is considered on an individual basis, particularly in circumstances where lack of transport would present a barrier to a patient being treated. Otherwise patients are responsible for their own transport.</P>
        <P>In the context of his examination of my Department&rsquo;s Appropriation Account for 2004, the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a review of the operation of the NTPF in 2004. During his review the Comptroller and Auditor General received the full and comprehensive co-operation of the fund. The responses from the fund and my Department to the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report have been fully recorded in the text of the report. As a statutory body funded by the Exchequer, the annual accounts of the national treatment purchase fund will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The fund&rsquo;s accounts for 2004 are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is a matter for him to decide which State organisations or State funded programmes are to be the subject of value-for-money audits.</P>
        <P>The fund will continue to arrange treatment for patients and the immediate priority for it in 2006 <Col N="1471"/>will be to ensure the fullest co-operation from individual hospitals and consultants in dealing with patients waiting longest for surgery. The Health Service Executive has been asked to ensure that this co-operation continues so that those patients waiting for treatment can be facilitated by the fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for her reply, but it is not very satisfactory. It was reported that a patient requiring minor eye surgery was transported by taxi from Dublin to Limerick at a cost of &euro;600. That report was made on 7 October, but now the T&aacute;naiste says it is not true. I am surprised, if it was not true, that it was not immediately rebutted.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste accept there are question marks over the national treatment purchase fund? This may grieve her because the fund is the particular baby of the Progressive Democrats. There are serious questions with regard to the value for money or otherwise of the fund. We know now that 36% of cases were seen in public hospitals which means in effect that those hospitals were paid twice to look after patients.</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste reflect again on what she said about no patient being denied access to care through the national treatment purchase fund? I have evidence to the contrary. A constituent of mine &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware there have been a number of cases where patients were approached by the NTPF, but when they were directed towards a hospital they were denied care? One was a constituent of mine. Is the Minister also aware of a case relating to a person from Dunboyne in County Meath? When the family phoned the hospital, it replied that it had received a written directive from the NTPF not to take any patients until January.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister reflect on her reply because I am sure she does not intentionally want to mislead the House? The examples I have given are the actual record and I ask the Minister to comment on it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I corrected the report of the &euro;600 taxi fare on the day it appeared. Many inaccuracies have been reported in recent weeks, including one that somebody turned up for surgery and it was cancelled and another that we had changed the medical guidelines for assessing terminally ill patients. Both were untrue, as is this report.</P>
        <P>When the treatment purchase fund arranges treatments for people, they proceed unless there is some medical or other reason they cannot, not a lack of funding. The fund got a budget for this <Col N="1472"/>year which I increased by 50% and it will spend that money this year. It arranges treatment with various hospitals, some 10% of which will be in public hospitals. The reason that 10% will be in public hospitals is that some of the surgery is very complex, particularly that relating to paediatrics. The facilities do not exist in private hospitals to have that treatment carried out. The figure was higher, but when I came to the Department of Health and Children I directed that no more than 10% of the treatment would take place in public hospitals because the idea is to provide treatment in spare capacity in the private sector for those that are waiting longest.</P>
        <P>The figures for those waiting more than 12 months for treatment are down by 70%. Those waiting for six to 12 months are down by 50%. For some 17 of the top 20 surgical procedures, the waiting period is two to four months. This is huge progress.</P>

	<P>I express my sincere sympathies to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh, RIP, who died tragically at Monaghan General Hospital last Friday. His death should not have happened. I have been informed that an intensive care bed was vacant in Cavan General Hospital when Mr. Walsh needed to be transferred.</P>
        <P>The circumstances surrounding this tragedy require thorough investigation. Mr. Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University, will carry out an independent and external review of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death. The review will be completed and a report will be issued within eight weeks. I look forward to the review answering all the questions relating to this tragic case as a matter of urgent public interest and patient safety.</P>
        <P>The policy approach in respect of surgical services for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group was set out in the 2004 report of a steering group that was established by the former North Eastern Health Board. The recommendations of the steering group, which was representative of all the key stakeholders and included consultant representation from both hospitals, were unanimously approved by the group&rsquo;s members. The steering group recommended that major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. The steering group&rsquo;s recommendations reflected the advice of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In accordance with the recommendations, a full surgical team based in Cavan will provide services at Monaghan General Hospital in the form of selective elective surgery on a Monday to Friday basis.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations, the hospital returned to offering 24-hour seven-day medical cover in January 2005. A third consultant physician has been in position since November 2004 and five new anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to medical on-call. The HSE recently appointed a non-practising lead consultant surgeon at the Cavan-Monaghan department of surgery. The remit of the surgeon is to oversee an implementation plan arising from the Royal College of Sur<Col N="1474"/>geons in Ireland&rsquo;s advice on the future configuration of surgical services in Cavan and Monaghan. Measures being taken in that regard include the appointment of surgeons to fill existing or forthcoming vacancies.</P>
        <P>The arrangements I have outlined, which are being put in place by the HSE, are designed to enhance the overall level of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. The HSE recently informed the Department of Health and Children that it will keep the matter under continuing review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that if we had taken on board the letter written by the consultants, we would not have had to endure the events of last Friday, which was a very sad day for the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh, who was admitted to Monaghan General Hospital on Thursday at 6 p.m. and died at 7 a.m. the following morning. We should not forget the other 16 deaths which have occurred since Monaghan General Hospital went off-call.</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that somebody is getting it wrong and that the people are not being listened to? Does she accept that the configuration of the health services preferred by the former chief executives is not working and is costing lives? It is not a case of whether another life will be lost but of when it will be lost. Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that the letter of 15 September last, in which each of the consultant surgeons in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group asked for on-call status be restored to Monaghan General Hospital for acute surgical emergencies, should have been dealt with as a matter of urgency? If the consultants&rsquo; request had been accepted, Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death could have been avoided.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultants&rsquo; letter constitutes a serious admission on their part that all is not well. The system is not working, it is unsafe, dangerous and costing lives. I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will take into consideration the view of those charged with delivering this service that it is not safe.</P>
        <P>The nation is shocked that the health service is in such a state that a person can be admitted to hospital, left in a hospital bed, given blood and allowed to die. Last Friday&rsquo;s tragedy is compounded by the fact that a bed was available. Was ageism a factor in this regard? A major investigation is needed. We need to be reassured.</P>
        <P>I am bitterly disappointed by the quality of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response to my question. I hoped she would say she would listen to the consultant surgeons who know what they are talking about. The T&aacute;naiste needs to ensure that on-call status is restored to Monaghan General Hospital for acute surgical emergencies, in line with the consultants&rsquo; <Col N="1475"/>request. Will the T&aacute;naiste assure the House that she will talk to every consultant surgeon in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group? Will she assure me that she will listen to these professional people?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my initial response, it is clear that the death of Mr. Patrick Walsh should not have happened. The inquiry I referred to previously will have to consider why the intensive care bed that was available at Cavan General Hospital was not made available to Mr. Walsh.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to receiving the outcome of the inquiry quickly as it is clear that many questions need to be answered.</P>
        <P>The issue of giving on-call or off-call status to certain hospital services, about which I was specifically asked, is a matter for the Health Service Executive. It is a question of patient safety rather than of resources. Deputy Connolly said that a group of surgeons called unanimously in a letter for the return of on-call emergency status at Monaghan General Hospital. However, the steering group that unanimously recommended that such status be retained at Cavan General Hospital included representatives of the group of surgeons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>They were not given a choice.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that the consultant surgeons wrote to the Health Service Executive because they had concerns about patient safety and because the steering group&rsquo;s report was not working? The people on the steering group had their hands tied. The consultant surgeons were asked to implement a configuration of services that was presented to them by the then chief executive officer. As the consultants have made it clear to us that the configuration in question is not working, we will have to address the matter by examining it again. Further deaths will occur if we do not do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We now have a new organisation. We have received the opinions of representatives of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland who are experts in this area. There are hospitals in Drogheda, Dundalk, Cavan, Monaghan and Navan. The HSE must decide on the configuration of hospitals in that region. It will decide on <Col N="1476"/>what will happen when and where. Patient safety must come first above all else. It must be paramount in any decision we make on this issue. It will guide us in making future decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultants signed the letter to which I referred because they are concerned about patient safety. They are concerned when they hear about 40 patients being placed on trolleys at Cavan General Hospital. They are concerned about not being able to cope. That is why the letter was sent to the HSE. The T&aacute;naiste cannot allow the problems to which I have referred to continue.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds and is in line with the commitment in the health strategy to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity has already taken place in acute hospitals. Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds in public acute hospitals. As of 14 October last, 806 of the beds or day places were in place and the remaining 94 beds or day places will come on stream over the coming months. A further 450 acute beds are at various stages of planning and development under the capital investment programme.</P>
        <P>Last July, I announced details of an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals over the next five years. The HSE has been asked to begin to develop an implementation plan and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals&rsquo; requirement for additional bed capacity. The additional beds will go most of the way to achieving the commitment in the programme for Government to increase total acute hospital capacity.</P><Col N="1477"/>
        <P>The health strategy acknowledges that a significant proportion of additional capacity in the acute hospital system will be supplied in future by private providers. The Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the HSE, will review public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in light of the developments since the health strategy was published and the progress of the initiatives I announced in July.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I take it from the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response that the answer to my question whether the provision of 3,000 acute hospital beds continues to be Government policy is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I offer my condolences to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh. The T&aacute;naiste and I know why the intensive care bed available in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group was not used. She needs to clarify this aspect of the matter at a later stage.</P>
        <P>I was tempted to begin my response to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s comments about Government policy by saying that it seems that she disagrees with her boss. Many people are confused about who runs the health services. I would have assumed that they are being run by the T&aacute;naiste, but it seems that Professor Drumm has become the driving force. He has said there is no need for more acute beds in the Irish hospital system. His comments may be seen as a U-turn on Government policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is quite clear. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System For You, that an additional 650 acute hospital beds would be provided in our health care system by the end of 2002. That announcement was made before the previous general election, but in October 2005 we have not yet provided that number of acute hospital beds in the health system. People are being misled. The T&aacute;naiste should make clear whether the Government is committed to delivering the 3,000 acute beds. There seems to be every indication it is not committed to this.</P>
        <P>Who decides Government policy? It is misleading for the general public when they hear the chief executive officer of the HSE making announcements like this one. He is responsible for the day-to-day running of our health services. As with the situation in Cavan and Monaghan, the T&aacute;naiste is responsible for the health services. I would like her to clarify whether and when we will have these acute hospital beds. More than one hospital in the country expects acute hospital beds to be delivered. The T&aacute;naiste should outline how committed she is to delivering these beds to the health services.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1478"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Beds will be delivered if they are necessary and not for the sake of it. The analysis done by Dr. Mary Codd, based on demographics, suggested we need 3,000 additional beds by 2011. Over 800 of these were provided up to October of this year.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm made the valid comment that if we had appropriate facilities for the elderly, we would immediately release a substantial number of beds. I stated in an earlier reply to the Deputy that 378 patients in the acute system in the Dublin area could be better placed if alternative facilities, which we are seeking to put in place, were available. This would release a substantial number of beds. With regard to the announcement I made in July on freeing up private beds in public hospitals, the intention is to provide 1,000 beds. There is huge interest in this initiative and I believe it will be successful. That, together with the 450 beds planned for Mullingar Hospital, the Mater Hospital, where 100 beds are planned, and a number of other locations throughout the country, will bring us very close to the target of 3,000 beds. We are optimistic we will achieve that target by 2011.</P>
        <P>Professor Drumm&rsquo;s job as chief executive officer of the HSE is to deliver health services. As there is no point making policy that is unnecessary, there must be a close working relationship between the Department and the operational side and policy side of the health service. If it were the case that either more beds or less beds were required, the policy makers would have to bear this in mind and reflect it in any policy decision made. However, as of now, to have a further 3,000 beds by 2011 is the plan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Are 1,000 of the 3,000 beds the ones she refers to being developed by the private system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>That was never announced at any stage of the health strategy. While the T&aacute;naiste came up with the figure of 1,000 beds, she must be quite clear where the beds will be located. Will she indicate where she expects these 1,000 beds to be found in a couple of years or what parts of the country are deemed to require them? It is difficult to work out in which public hospitals the beds will be located.</P>
        <P>The role of the HSE is an important factor. To use the term used by the Taoiseach last week, the T&aacute;naiste is almost dumping on the HSE all the problems cropping up in the health services. The T&aacute;naiste, to some degree, and the Taoiseach are not taking personal responsibility for many of the problems arising in the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<?oasys _dc20-?><P>I do not accept that. With regard to the question of where the beds will be located, we <Col N="1479"/>considered the private activity in public hospitals. For example, last year some 46% of elective surgery at Tallaght Hospital was carried out on private patients. The beds will be located in Waterford, Limerick, where plans are fairly advanced, and in Dublin at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown, which all have plans. The matter is one for the HSE to advance, considering the overall needs of particular hospitals and the situation in each area. We do not want to displace existing private hospitals so the process must make sense at a local level as well.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P Just="Left">I do not accept that we are not taking responsibility. There are clear lines of accountability under the new arrangement. There is one Minister for Health and Children, responsible to the Oireachtas for health policy. The chief executive officer of the HSE is the Accounting Officer and he is responsible to the Oireachtas for the expenditure of money on day-to-day health care services.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 445 reported cases of MRSA blood-stream infection in 2002, 480 cases in 2003 and 550 cases in 2004. The figure for the first six months of 2005 is 314 cases. The increase in the reported number of cases of MRSA in recent years is mainly due to increased surveillance as a result of more laboratories participating in the reporting process. It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant other medical problems. I have already asked the Health Service Executive to develop systems and methodologies of reporting of MRSA infections by hospital, so we may have a fuller picture of the location and extent of these infections.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired infections, including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA. Good hand hygiene is one of the simplest and most effective measures that can be used to stop the spread of MRSA and other infections.</P><Col N="1480"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.2-?><P>I expect to receive a report shortly from the director of the National Hospitals Office on the national hygiene audit. The results of the audit will form the basis for the changes that are required in work environments and work practices so as to meet the highest possible standards of cleanliness in hospital settings. I have already promised that the results of the hygiene audit will be made public. The HSE will also publish national infection control standards and national cleaning standards, which are a consistent and robust set of hygiene standards for hospitals. Where previously standards may have depended on the approach of a particular hospital or health board, the HSE can now ensure every hospital will share and meet the same high standards of cleanliness and infection control. My Department is continuing to engage with the HSE to agree a series of actions over the coming period so MRSA can be effectively dealt with, so as to achieve a reduction in the incidence and effects of these infections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for that information. The increase in the number of MRSA cases being reported is startling and we all recognise there is under-reporting. I take it we are only talking about hospitals whereas information in regard to nursing homes and the wider community is not included. Therefore, I presume the figures should be much higher.</P>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept the news that five babies in the national maternity hospital are carriers of MRSA is a matter of great concern? Is she able to state that staff within hospitals are doing what she asks, namely, washing their hands? What method has she to evaluate this? Does she accept this is not just a matter of washing hands? Indeed, she has been criticised by a senior consultant for trivialising the matter by stating it is about cleanliness and the washing of hands when there is also the issue of overcrowding. What does she have to say about the impact of overcrowding on the rate and extent of infections, such as MRSA, within our hospitals? How does she intend to achieve the OECD level of 85% bed occupancy? What are her plans in regard to these issues, which I am sure she will agree are as important as that of washing hands?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the issue is about more than washing hands, although all the international evidence and the expert medical advice available to me would suggest it makes the single greatest contribution. It will be a matter for the HSE. The audit, which will be published by the end of this month, will give us baseline figures and will provide interesting data, hospital by hospital, which can be measured on an ongoing basis. That will be significant.</P>
        <P>There is now a major emphasis on hygiene and cleanliness. However, I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that more isolation wards are needed. The international average would suggest there should not <Col N="1481"/>be bed occupancy of more than 80%-85%. The hospital of the future will have many more single rooms than is the case at present. There have always been hospital infections. Our duty is to minimise these by using the hygiene tools available to us. We need more isolation facilities and it is clear that more beds would make an important contribution to this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not want to delay, I ask that the T&aacute;naiste reconsider this approach. I have no doubt that people die from MRSA but it is not being attributed as the cause of death. We need to know how many because there are clearly cases of individuals who have died from MRSA. It is simply unacceptable that the Minister for Health and Children is unable to tell us how many such cases there are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not only the Minister for Health and Children who is not able to tell the Deputy, nobody else can tell her either because we do not have that data recorded. People acquire MRSA in many settings and not exclusively in a hospital environment. As I said, the HSE will work on a hospital by hospital reporting mechanism. If it is possible to separate the data and establish if somebody died from MRSA as opposed to something else, clearly it would be desirable to have that data. At present we report incidence of MRSA in hospital settings and they are the figures I have.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 114, 126 and 144 together.</P>
        <P>In January 2005 I increased the income guidelines used in the assessment of medical card applications by 7.5%. In June it was apparent that the effect of rising income in our successful economy meant that the target of 30,000 additional medical cards would not be achieved. At this time I simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant&rsquo;s and spouse&rsquo;s income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. This is much fairer to applicants.</P>
        <P>I announced on 13 October 2005 that the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than this time last year. This substantial increase in the assessment guidelines will allow many more people to visit their family doctor free of charge. I urge people to apply straight away for these important benefits. I understand from the HSE that issues raised by IMPACT and SIPTU, which represent HSE staff assessing applications, have been addressed.</P>
        <P>The HSE has advised my Department that in the period from January to September this year, nearly 150,000 new medical cards were issued while just over 145,000 were withdrawn for various reasons, including death, income changes and data updates. Many people have benefited by getting a medical card for the first time in 2005.</P>
        <P>A simple comparison of the 1997 to 2005 figures does not take account of the fact that over 104,000 invalid cards have been removed since that time following concerns which arose about inaccurate GMS lists. If allowance is made for the <Col N="1483"/>effect <?oasys _cl11.5-?>of this necessary exercise, there has been a net increase over the period of 10,000.</P>
        <P>My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor the number of cards issued. The Government&rsquo;s commitment in the programme for Government to extend eligibility for medical cards will be kept under review in the light of other competing service priorities, available resources and the graduated benefits approach which I introduced with the GP visit card.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like the Minister to give a commitment on a few issues regarding the doctor only medical card and the full medical card. The doctor only medical card which is being introduced along side the full medical card is being seen as a means to give some help to those at the margins of entitlement to a medical card. Currently 1.1 million people have a full medical card and many of those patients are concerned that the Minister will try to substitute the full medical card with the doctor only medical card. Will the Minister draw up a minimum number of the population who will be entitled to a full medical card?</P>
        <P>I would also like the Minister to clarify a statement I believe she made. She said a family comprising a mother, father and two children with an income of &euro;850 per week would be entitled to a doctor only medical card. That would not seem to gel with the information I am getting from some of the local HSE offices when people apply for medical cards. The Minister is being a little generous and is including every entitlement going. She should make it clear that the income threshold is not &euro;850 per week because many people will believe they are entitled to doctor only medical cards if they earn less than &euro;850 per week which is, of course, far from the case.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister give a commitment that full medical cards will not be substituted with doctor only medical cards in the years ahead because of this policy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true that somebody in those circumstances, depending on their outgoings, can qualify for a medical card. For example, the basic income is &euro;266.50 per week with a child dependant allowance of &euro;76, child care expenses of &euro;220, housing or mortgage payments of &euro;190 and travel to work of &euro;50. We gave a number of examples last week and published the data. The whole purpose is not to have a percentage of the population on medical cards but to try to ensure whatever resources are available are targeted at those who need them most.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Incomes have risen very sharply in this economy in recent years. In fact, official data are way behind what is happening in the real economy. Although 150,000 new medical cards have been issued this year to date, there was not an <Col N="1484"/>additional net 30,000 because many people fell out of the net due to income or otherwise.</P>
        <P>The doctor only medical card is an initiative to have a graduated level of benefit. By providing doctor only medical cards, it allowed us to give the card to four times more people than if we stayed with the traditional medical card. I have always been a fan of graduated benefits. It means that families on low enough incomes and, in some cases, on modest gross incomes, depending on their outgoings, will not be afraid to go to the doctor because of the resource implications. In fact, the Deputy advocated such a proposal previously. Many general practitioners felt this would be a good idea, which I believe it will be.</P>
        <P>There is no intention to substitute the traditional card with the doctor only card. We want to maintain the current regime where those on the lowest incomes, social welfare recipients, those over 70 years of age and people with particular difficulties get the full medical card and where the next layer, depending on income and particular circumstances, will get the doctor only medical card.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister share my view that those who need the medical card the most are children and that if she wants to make a real difference in regard to health care not only in the current situation but as an investment into the future, she should address the needs of children now? Will she indicate if she has considered, proposed or has argued for at Cabinet the extension of full medical card cover to all children under 18 years of age and if not, will she explain why?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not a great fan of universal payments to everyone regardless of means because that hits those who are not as well off unfairly, that is, if relatively rich people get the same benefits as less well off people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what has been done for the over 70s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>When one applies something universally to a class of individuals &mdash; in this case, children &mdash; it can be unfair on others because one has a finite amount of resources. All the evidence suggests that the medical need is greatest among lower income families in particular. That is what we are doing with the traditional medical card and the doctor only card. Given that we increased the income guidelines by 20% last week, since this time last year, the income threshold has gone up 29%. There is a further 25% top up for the doctor only card. That should include a whole host of people who heretofore had to pay to go to the doctor. It is a welcome measure and we should review it as time goes on.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1485"/>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point that it is lower income families who need these cards the most. However, does she not accept the reality that there are many families on what would be regarded as moderate incomes who, because of their commitment to the workplace, namely, two earning parents, the outlay on child care, mortgages and other such expenses, which were not all together reflected even in the new configuration she announced last week, face hardship and that children suffer in such circumstances? I do not believe the T&aacute;naiste can universally apply her earlier response and claim children are not suffering as a consequence. They are suffering and the only way to ensure all children are adequately catered for and that we invest in the health of the nation is through the extension of full medical card cover to all children under 18 years. Will the T&aacute;naiste accept this proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this because using gross income is not a fair way of calculating entitlement. That is why there are deductions for tax purposes, such as PRSI, travel-to-work, mortgage repayments and child care. For example, a single mother with one dependent child can earn more than &euro;584 a week and still get a full medical card depending on her outgoings. Travel to work could cost &euro;40 a week and child care &euro;100 a week. These can be added to her income when she is assessed for a full medical card. The new assessment mechanism will help us to target both the full and doctor-only card to those who need it most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Having heard the T&aacute;naiste say she does not believe in universal benefits, was the reason she supported the over-70s medical card scheme to attract votes in the last general election? She seemed to be overriding her natural inclination against universal benefits. The Government promised 200,000 medical cards. When will we get them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a commitment on medical cards in the election manifesto of my colleagues in Government. We will get more than 200,000 medical cards with the doctor-only cards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we get them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>We must become less fixated with numbers and target the needs of families, children and the elderly. The way the Government is doing this, particularly discounting income outgoings, will ensure many people who traditionally would not have qualified because of their gross earnings will now come into the medical card net with either the full or doctor-only card. The doctor-only card meets the needs of a substantial number of people, particularly those with chil<Col N="1486"/>dren. They want to be confident that if a child is sick they can get the opinion of the doctor without worrying about costs. Often in such cases, no follow-up medication is required.</P>
        <P>Older people have greater health needs than younger people. However, the costs of the over 70s has been high. Issues have arisen in the context of re-negotiating the GMS contract. Some elderly patients are worth more than others to particular doctors. It must be asked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 168 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>Haemophilus influenzae type B is a bacteria that can cause serious infections in humans, particularly in children, but also in individuals with a weakened immune system. Haemophilus influenzae type B bacteria is one of six haemophilus types. It can cause several diseases such as otitis media, or bacterial or viral infection of the <Col N="1487"/>middle ear, meningitis, pneumonia, septicaemia, epiglottitis septic arthritis, cellulitis and osteomyelitis. Known as Hib, it lives in the nose and throats of humans and is transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets or contact with respiratory secretions. The bacteria may be carried around in the nose and throat for a short while or for several months without causing symptoms, in an asymptomatic carrier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this a medical lecture?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In some individuals, particularly those most at risk, Hib will invade the body causing invasive disease.</P>
        <P>The Hib vaccine was introduced into Ireland in 1992 and since then babies have been routinely immunised at two, four and six months of age. There was a dramatic decrease in the number of Hib cases from 100 per year in the late 1980s to ten cases or less by 2002. Although a slight increase in total Hib diseases has been seen since 2003, the total number of cases in children under 15 years has only increased slightly. There were seven cases in 2002, ten in 2003, nine in 2004 and 11 up to September of this year.</P>
        <P>Most of the cases were in non-vaccinated children up to 2004. The priority was to improve the vaccination uptake. A recent cause of concern has been the steady increase in the number of children developing Hib disease despite full vaccination, referred to as the Hib vaccine failures. From 1996 to 2003, one to four children each year developed Hib despite full vaccination. This rose to six in 2004 and there have been ten cases this year to September.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The national immunisation advisory committee has been keeping the position under review. A letter on 28 July recommended that the Department implement a catch-up campaign for children from six months to four years of age as soon as possible. In addition, the advisory committee will recommend a booster dose of Hib vaccines as part of the primary immunisation schedule in the planned new additions to the guidelines. The Health Service Executive announced on 20 September that it made the introduction of a campaign an urgent priority. It will commence its introduction as soon as possible.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The campaign is due to be launched in November 2005. It will be implemented on a phased basis over six months, phase 1 to cover children aged one year and not yet two years, phase 2, children aged two years and not yet three years, phase 3, children aged three years and not yet four years. Children becoming 12 months of age during the campaign will also be offered the vaccine. A portion of the vaccine has already arrived and will be distributed to general practitioners.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>An initial letter will be forwarded to general practitioners in the coming week advising them <Col N="1488"/>of the phased implementation. Further letters will issue at the commencement of each phase of the campaign. A letter will be issued to all parents and guardians of children in each of the phases inviting them to attend for vaccination. Information leaflets for parents and health professionals have been compiled and will be circulated prior to the commencement of the campaign. Public awareness initiatives will also be organised at the commencement of each phase of the campaign.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply, much of which was not requested. It was an interesting lecture in the background to the issue. Can I have the attention of the Minister of State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy had and has my undivided attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>While 48,000 doses of the booster vaccine will be available this October, 180,000 children need it. The immunisation committee is concerned by this. It wrote to the Department in July but this is the amount we are informed about now. Rather than concentrating on extraneous items, how soon will those 180,000 children be provided for? Has the Health Service Executive received the additional funding of &euro;10 million needed to protect these children? The Minister of State is aware the issue received much media attention because a child died.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Correspondence was written on 28 July 2005 and the Chief Medical Officer in the Department received it on 3 August 2005. The Department then took the matter up with the national director of population health in the Health Service Executive, referring to the recommendations of the national council and requesting that appropriate action be taken to provide an effective level of community protection. On 16 August 2005, the assistant director of population health to the Health Service Executive wrote to the Department and confirmed the Health Service Executive was keen to implement the recommendations and that planning for this had commenced on 6 September.</P>
        <P>The Department reaffirmed to the Health Service Executive that the allocation of resources for this priority public health initiative was a matter for the Health Service Executive having regard to its contingency fund and the 2006 Estimates process. The executive announced on 20 September 2005 it had made the introduction of the campaign an urgent priority and will commence its introduction as soon as possible. This is the history of the Department&rsquo;s involvement in the matter. I have outlined the basis of the campaign which will be launched in mid-November <Col N="1489"/>and will be on a phased basis of six months, starting with the relevant categories of children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>There are 48,000 doses available now. Within the six months of the campaign, will full cover be provided and accessed by the children in question? Is that what the Minister is saying? A campaign can be many things. I am asking about the release of vaccines.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it a portion of the vaccine has already arrived.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the 48,000 doses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. The rest is ordered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When will it come? That is not much comfort to those not among the 48,000 to receive the vaccine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the six-month campaign is to cover all the relevant categories.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Campaigns are one thing. I asked about the delivery of vaccines. There are problems with vaccines in other areas. All I want to know is when the Government will have the full complement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to communicate with the Deputy on that matter. I do not have details of when particular consignments of vaccines will be delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State would.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has issued a tender for the vaccines. There has been the usual delay of 25 days, although it might have been 52 days had it been a normal tendering process. He has not, therefore, taken ownership of even one of the vaccines yet. That is the problem. A great deal of misleading information has been given. The long story the Minister of State told leading up to this gives a good indication of what is happening.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive had no intention of purchasing any of these vaccines in 2005 because of a lack of funding. The Minister of State&rsquo;s chronology explains what went wrong. There was a public outcry before 20 September and then suddenly the HSE announced it would get the vaccines as soon as possible. Even up to ten days before that it had no intention of doing so. I know because I was on a radio interview with the same person from the HSE who said the executive did not have the resources for that year. When the publicity built up the resources suddenly became available. That is the truth.</P>
        <P>The nub of the question is when the Minister of State will take delivery of the vaccines. Pro<Col N="1490"/>tracted negotiations have meant there are no vaccines to give to children who are most at risk from the disease this winter. They need a booster in their second year. The history of what happened is not important. We just need to get the vaccines and start vaccinating children, especially those who are most vulnerable in this winter season.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I provided full information to the House on the question in so far as I could. I do not believe the content of an answer in those circumstances should be the subject of the kind of criticism the Deputy initially made. The purpose of answers to parliamentary questions is to give information to the House and that is what I did. It was certainly not an attempt to obscure any issue. The Deputy is wrong to suggest that no vaccine has arrived yet. My information is that a portion has already arrived and the balance will be delivered early next year.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister of State saying that the 48,000 vaccines are in the cold chain at this moment, ready to be delivered to doctors&rsquo; surgeries to give to children?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>A portion of the vaccine has already arrived in the country and will be distributed to general practitioners. That is what I am saying to the House. The balance will be delivered in the spring. I gave the full history of correspondence between the relevant national council, the Department and the HSE which shows that decisions were not taken on foot of any radio discussions the Deputy might have been involved in.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the correspondence makes clear, the HSE is provided with a contingency fund. It plans from year to year and takes part in an Estimates process every year. As the Deputy is well aware, the sum voted to that body is very substantial and gives it some creative choice to meet emergencies that arise. That is why we have a Health Service Executive. I have no evidence that at any stage funds available to the HSE were insufficient.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the House will agree that we should express our condolences and sincere sympathies with the family of the late Pat Joe Walsh who died in Monaghan General Hospital on Friday last. Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death was the latest in a number of tragic incidents in the north-eastern health area. Difficulties with health and hospital services are not new. The Taoiseach will be aware in recent years of the tragic case of Bronagh Livingstone and Benny McCullagh. It seems clear that the decision to withdraw permission to medical staff in Monaghan General Hospital to carry out surgical procedures after 5 p.m. was a critical feature in this latest tragic case.</P>
      <P>One year ago this party tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion expressing concern over issues of quality in the health service in this area. Earlier this year I raised this matter with the Taoiseach on leaders&rsquo; questions. Despite these political warnings nothing has changed. In the last two days both he and the T&aacute;naiste have sought to distance themselves from any political responsibility for this tragedy and are now desperately trying to point a finger at the Health Service Executive. Today, in an article under a headline entitled &ldquo;You would not let an animal die the way he <Col N="1492"/>died&rdquo;, the T&aacute;naiste says that all questions relating to services and facilities available at different hospitals are now a matter for the HSE to determine. On Monday the Taoiseach is quoted as urging the HSE to look at hospital services in the Monaghan region and resolve the issues. He is further quoted as saying he hoped the HSE would resolve this situation.</P>
      <P>The people are outraged at this latest tragedy. It is incomprehensible how a man can be allowed to die and his life&rsquo;s blood to flow away when the personnel, skills and theatre facilities were available in Monaghan General Hospital to carry out a life saving procedure. It is utterly astonishing the Government continues to wash its hands of political responsibility for the chaotic state of the health services.</P>
      <P>Under section 10 of the Health Act 2004, the Minister for Health and Children can issue a written directive to the HSE. Will she now issue such a directive that in similar circumstances no administrative procedure will prevent surgical teams from carrying out life saving operations on any patient? Will the Taoiseach explain to the House and to the people how the circumstances surrounding the death of this man in Monaghan General Hospital are a matter for the HSE, but if the executive wants to buy a single computer, it is a matter for the Department of Health and Children? Arising out of this latest tragedy will the Taoiseach now see to it that Monaghan General Hospital is put back on call?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I join Deputy Kenny and the T&aacute;naiste when she raised the matter earlier in extending my sincere sympathies to the family and friends of Patrick Walsh of Carrickmacross who died at Monaghan General Hospital last Friday, 14 October. The circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Walsh will, as we heard from the T&aacute;naiste earlier, be the subject of an independent review to be undertaken on behalf of the Health Service Executive by Mr. Patrick Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast City Hospital. That review is to be completed and a report issued within the timeframe outlined by the T&aacute;naiste. The terms of reference for the review are being finalised, but it will cover the period commencing with the admission of Mr. Walsh to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda on 21 September until Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death in Monaghan on 14 October. The report will be furnished to the director of the national hospitals&rsquo; office of the Health Service Executive who will make recommendations as he sees fit. The HSE in the north-east area has contacted the family of Mr. Walsh and a meeting will take place today. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has also offered to meet the family if they so wish.</P><Col N="1493"/>
      <P>Earlier today the T&aacute;naiste outlined the circumstances of the incident. This is clearly a tragic event. It is difficult for people to explain. I do not attempt to explain it. The patient had been in hospital since 21 September, was released on 13 October and came back in the following day. The medical records and those who were dealing clinically with the patient were in the hospital in Drogheda, but he was brought to Monaghan hospital when there was a bed in Cavan hospital. I do not understand why this happened.</P>
      <P>I know difficulties have existed in the area for some time, but I will not use the tragic and regrettable death of Mr. Walsh to get into those arguments. I met the Hospital Alliance last Friday night when I first heard of this case some hours after the death of Mr. Walsh. The Hospital Alliance outlined the case explaining to me that Mr. Walsh could not have an operation in the hospital because of protocols set out. As the T&aacute;naiste outlined those protocols were from the recommendations of the steering group which were unanimously approved by members of the group in the interests of patient safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It was some safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is, but those were the circumstances and the T&aacute;naiste outlined them in great detail. The death of a person is regrettable, but it is important that the examination and recommendations with regard to what is now necessary are quickly dealt with. I am not here to answer for medical or clinical decisions as to why Mr. Walsh was treated in one hospital and sent to another when an intensive care bed was available in yet another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The late Mr. Walsh was not released from the hospital in Drogheda, he was transferred to Monaghan Hospital. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s revelation that an intensive care bed existed in Cavan Hospital makes this even worse. The Taoiseach should make a public statement on why this intensive care bed in Cavan was not used, as the public has an interest.</P>
      <P>Political responsibility for the chaotic services within the health system rests with the Government. After nine years and record amounts of money being spent, this is the situation. In November 2004, at a meeting of the PD constituencies, the T&aacute;naiste stated, &ldquo;if we put money in but it flows away, gets diverted and loses its force before it delivers results for the public, we have a big problem&rdquo;. This was not a case of money flowing away but a man&rsquo;s blood flowing away. That man is now dead.</P>
      <P>Despite all the promises made, there was no room at the inn for Pat Joe Walsh. When Monaghan Hospital inquired, there was no room at Cavan, Drogheda, or Beaumont Hospital. The Taoiseach is shifting political responsibility for <Col N="1494"/>this incident to the HSE. We were also promised trained paramedics on all ambulances but this has not happened. The family of the late Pat Joe Walsh and the public in general deserve to know what happened, and the Taoiseach should make a public statement on the bed in Cavan Hospital not being used. He should confirm that the report of the public inquiry will be published in full so that people will know the full tragic consequences for Pat Joe Walsh and his family of a Government that is unable to cope with the realities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The death of Mr. Walsh is a tragedy and I will not bring that into arguments about other circumstances. The Deputy posed the question as to why Mr. Walsh was transferred when he was in a hospital since 21 September and when there was a bed in Cavan. Why did this happen? Why did they check with Beaumont Hospital? Did they check with Beaumont? To inquire into these and all the related questions the T&aacute;naiste has given the investigative task to an eminent consultant surgeon.</P>
      <P>There is a separate question over the 106,000 people working and saving many people&rsquo;s lives in top-class operations and services. It is not correct to indicate that they are not doing immense work every day, or that they are not being properly resourced and managed every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have tragic circumstances here that will be investigated. The report will be published as we will all have an interest in it. I will not accept that there should be political accountability every time a person dies anywhere in our health service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in extending condolences on this terrible but avoidable tragedy. Reading the graphic description in the newspapers this morning on the way this man died one is reluctant to focus on the matter at all. It must cause additional grief to the family. Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s sister is quoted this morning saying that an animal would not be let die in the way that her brother died. Nevertheless, the family and people in general will expect us in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the national parliament of the people, to raise this question. How can it happen in a civilised country in 2005 that a man should die in a fashion that I will not repeat from the newspapers this morning because it makes such unbearable reading?</P>
      <P>When one considers policy in health services at the moment one must come to the conclusion that the service is in free fall. Nothing competes with this tragic example in highlighting the extent of the acute crisis in critical aspects of the management of the health services. The T&aacute;naiste, when she came into office, published a ten-point programme to deal with this situation. Almost none of the ten points has been implemented. I could not believe it when I heard her state earlier that there has been a 22% reduction in patients on trolleys between April and September. The period between April and September is in high summer. That is the kind of sleight of hand that she would be the first to condemn out of the mouth of any other Member of this House. We are not even in winter, but the T&aacute;naiste adduces figures about what happened in the summer. She may as well state that there has been a reduction in the winter vomiting bug between April and September, such is the relevance of what she said.</P>
      <P>What is the position on beds inappropriately occupied? Is it true, as <i>The Irish Times</i> reported yesterday, that 378 beds are inappropriately occupied in the acute hospitals in Dublin alone? How many such beds have been freed up as a result of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten-point plan? Could we have some answers to these questions rather than some sleight of hand about what happened in the height of the best summer enjoyed since the rainbow Government in 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste referred to the 378 beds earlier in her answer to a question on the issue. She also pointed out the range of issues of the ten-point plan on accident and emergency departments that are being implemented. A number of them have been implemented while <Col N="1496"/>others are on the way. The acute units are being extended in hospital accident and emergency departments to help in the assistance. Most staffing issues are also being dealt with. There are still problems in some of the accident and emergency departments, although not in all of them, which are being resolved.</P>
      <P>We are trying to find alternative locations for long-stay patients in acute hospitals so that such patients do not hold back those hospitals but have adequate medical care in other locations. The figures have already been given for those who have been accommodated in recent weeks. A significant number of patients in hospitals in Dublin and elsewhere have been accommodated in private nursing homes and in alternative care. These are satisfactory arrangements and have allowed the beds in acute hospitals to be used for those who come in through accident and emergency departments or for treatment.</P>
      <P>We will continue to try to improve the throughput and to free more beds, so that accident and emergency departments do not have the problems that they currently experience and people can be dealt with. As the T&aacute;naiste also pointed out, we are trying to provide home care packages and arrangements where people who do not want to be in hospital can be cared for in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the eighth year of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s leadership and he keeps reeling off these figures like they represent some kind of improvement. The T&aacute;naiste had promised significant improvement by this autumn. From what she said today, we know that such is not the case. I do not know whether the Taoiseach is right in saying that the T&aacute;naiste had already given out the figures I quoted, but they were in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning. They highlighted the lack of progress made.</P>
      <P>I must ask the question again. How many acute beds have become available as a result of the implementation of the ten-point programme? Now that the HSE is established, will there be a pattern of a washing of hands, avoiding political accountability and political responsibility? When asked about this in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, the Taoiseach responded:</P>
      <P LI="1">The consultants up there in Monaghan, the medics, are fairly exhausted with all this and I just hope in the context of this, the HSE not only have an inquiry into the circumstances, but that they try to improve the situation.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">We keep on putting in money. Every time I go back there I make another announcement about more resources, then I keep hearing that they&rsquo;re caught up with all these protocols tied into their physicians and surgeons.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What does that mean if it is not a passing of the buck by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government to the HSE? Meanwhile, Professor <Col N="1497"/>Drumm has been announcing policy initiatives, which I thought was the responsibility of the Minister.</P>
      <P>No one knows where they stand in the north east, with all the chopping and changing that has gone on over 20 years. If the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children insists, as a matter of protocol, that no emergency surgical procedures be available before or after 5 p.m. in Monaghan General Hospital, surely it is imperative that such a facility be available nearby. How is it that the adjacent hospitals can refuse a patient? I point out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is not a matter for smiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not smiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How can a patient be refused in such circumstances <i>in extemis</i>? It is beyond belief that he could be turned away in circumstances like these. The people expect the Head of Government to answer that question in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is precisely what I would like the inquiry to find out. We have five hospitals in Cavan, Monaghan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan with considerable resources. They should be able to work together to try to deal with the issue. The Deputy said there were no resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>They are under-resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When I spoke the other night to the members of the group from Monaghan, who were very responsible and put their case to me even though the tragedy had happened hours earlier, they told me that to have the additional facility, they would need two extra nurses as they had the infrastructure and the medical personnel. We spent &euro;12.4 billion, so I do not think it is a question of resources.</P>

	<P>This is Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, I should not have responded. Deputy Rabbitte asked about the three categories of bed to which the T&aacute;naiste referred. Of those in high dependency beds, 48 with more demanding needs have been contacted by private nursing homes. A total of 318 patients have been discharged in 95 intermediate care beds for six-day week stays since contracts with private providers began in May. Additional home care packages and enhanced subventions have facilitated the discharge of 246 patients and 94 patients, respectively, from hospitals in the Dublin area. In total, around 700 patients have been removed from the hospital system this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy approach in respect of the surgical services for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group was set out in 2004 in a report of the steering group established by the former North Eastern Health Board. That group was representative of all the stakeholders and included consultant representation from both hospital sites in surgery, medicine and radiology. The recommendations of the report were unanimously approved by the numbers of the group. The steering group recommended that major and emergency services should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. The report&rsquo;s recommendations reflected what the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland stated. I know that people would like to think that these are political decisions, but that is not so.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the steering group, a full surgical team based in Cavan would provide the services at Monaghan General Hospital in the form of selective elective surgery from Monday to Friday. Also in accordance with the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations, the hospital returned to 24 hour, seven day medical cover ten months ago, in January. A third consultant position has been in place since this time last year and five new anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to being on-call. These decisions were thought out, whether rightly or wrongly, in the interests of patients and were set out in the report last year.</P>

	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I extend our sincere sympathy to the siblings, nephews, nieces and extended family of the deceased, Patrick Walsh. Go nd&eacute;anfaidh Dia tr&oacute;caire ar a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the Taoiseach visited County Monaghan. I welcome his meeting with the community alliance which has been campaigning for years against the cuts in services at Monaghan General Hospital. Nevertheless, it is important to note that I am extremely disappointed that he refused to meet the members of Monaghan County Council, the democratically elected members and representatives of the people of that county, on the same issue. That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach carried out official engagements in County Monaghan, a 70 year old man, Patrick Walsh, lay in Monaghan General Hospital suffering from a bleeding ulcer. It is important to make this point. The staff at Monaghan General <Col N="1499"/>Hospital did all they were allowed to do for him. However, because of the embargo on emergency surgery in the hospital, they could not operate on Mr. Walsh. That is the bottom line. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Cavan General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital in Dublin could not or would not accept him. A detailed account of the facts which is not an exercise in scapegoating is now eagerly awaited. However, one cannot escape the fact that even if Mr. Walsh could not be transferred or moved, the surgeons in the hospital in which he lay, who have an excellent record, excellent support staff and a state-of-the-art theatre, could not operate on him because of protocols. They could not operate because of a policy that the Taoiseach and his Government have imposed on the health services in this State.</P>
      <P>These are the policies of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government and no amount of handwashing can change that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is his Government&rsquo;s implementation of the Hanly report that led directly to the death of Patrick Walsh. This policy was already in operation before Mr. Hanly reported at all. Make no mistake about it, up to 16 unnecessary and avoidable deaths have occurred in Monaghan General Hospital over the period since the tragic loss of baby Bronagh Livingstone.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that ongoing adherence to this policy is nothing less than criminal? When will the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste listen to the public, to the patients, to the health care professionals at Cavan and Monaghan and a variety of other professional opinion already expressed? When will they restore the life-saving services that have been taken from our hospital and community?</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that last month, the consultant surgeons at Cavan and Monaghan hospitals signed a joint appeal to the Health Service Executive and indeed to the T&aacute;naiste to allow Monaghan General Hospital to go back on call for acute surgical emergencies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the Health Service Executive should provide the resources to allow that to happen? Nothing has happened since. We have had the death of Patrick Walsh. How many more unnecessary avoidable deaths must be witnessed at Monaghan or allied to the situation in Monaghan before the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste listen and heed the cry of a people who are not second class citizens <Col N="1500"/>and are not prepared to accept a second class health service?</P>

	<P>In reply to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, it is not a question of an embargo. Protocols were set down following an examination of these matters last year, when a professional steering group that was not composed of politicians or people wishing to make political points, looked at these issues. When the group examined the surgical, medical and radiological facilities in the hospitals, it came to an agreement on protocols. It was unanimously approved and has been followed as a matter of policy since then.</P>

As Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in is aware, I have met the group &mdash; the people at the coalface, the medics, the GPs and the consultants &mdash; twice. I am sorry that Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in feels that the local public representatives might have known more than the consultants and other staff. I agreed to meet the group which I thought would best know how the hospital should be run, rather than acceding to a late request which I received from some public representatives.</P>

	<P>The people are entitled to a health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The group itself stated that it is not a question of resources, it is an issue of patient safety. An independent group of people who know far more than either the Deputy or myself, namely, the medical and surgical staff, with the Royal College of Surgeons, decided they did not believe, in the circumstances, that it was safe. I know that is disputed. The Deputy would rightly say to me that I would be entirely irresponsible to take action, ignoring the professional views of the Royal College of Surgeons, medics and medical and surgical consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever the view was, the man is dead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was a question of only two nurses the resolution would be easy. However, an examination of the region led to these conclusions. Deputy Rabbitte is correct. I find it difficult to know what the groups I listen to are at, but I will wait for the report. If it is as simple a matter as the people in Monaghan tell me, I cannot understand why the Royal College of Surgeons made its decision. I will await that report with interest but will not pre-empt it, nor should the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it incredulous that the people the Taoiseach has met who are not working in the hospital system but are well informed about its needs would have said that two nurses would be the panacea for all the difficulties that have arisen in Monaghan General Hospital as a result of his Government&rsquo;s policy of the diminution of its services over many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should not seek to apportion blame outside his shared responsibility. Instead, he must undertake in conjunction with the T&aacute;naiste to listen to a set of professionals and not to always use the crutch of the Royal College of Surgeons or any other expert group. To say it has a monopoly on wisdom on this or any other issue is ridiculous. It is plain to the people of County Monaghan, whether we have professional expertise, what is required in order to ensure the safe delivery of acute hospital services at Monaghan General <Col N="1503"/>Hospital. The Taoiseach must require the HSE to act.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Concerning the inquiry into the death of Mr. Patrick Walsh, it must not only cover the immediate circumstances. However, if the Taoiseach wishes to say this Deputy has his mind made up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;about what has been a very important contributory fact, the inquiry must include an examination of the disastrous policies that directly contributed to the death of Mr. Patrick Walsh and so many others. Will the Taoiseach instruct the T&aacute;naiste at this late stage, as Minister with responsibility for health, to in turn instruct the HSE to put Monaghan General Hospital back on emergency surgical call? We need the restoration of what we and most reasonable people throughout this country view as a fundamental service and an expectation of any citizen of what should be available at a local general hospital. It is still a general hospital in name at least. Surgical services, including accident and emergency, are a key component of that delivery mechanism.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to ensure this is the legacy of the tragic death of Mr. Patrick Walsh and many more and not to have a situation arise where I and my colleague Deputies from counties Cavan and Monaghan and other concerned voices throughout the country must confront him with yet another tragedy within our community.</P>

	<P>Since September, I have met people including medics and not just the people involved in the alliance. I have also met the surgical consultants in Monaghan General Hospital, who gave me their views. I have seen the letter signed by the counties Cavan and Monaghan consultants.

	<P>It is not a matter of the Royal College of Surgeons dictating anything. The <Col N="1504"/>college is the professional body that reflects advice. Its recommendations to the steering group were given in the interests of patients&rsquo; safety.</P>

Some of the facilities are available and ready to open, which I hope happens. Other developments are taking place in some of the wards concerned. However, they are separate issues that are being dealt with by the HSE and I hope they will be resolved.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice Bill 2004: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the limited time available, I want to deal with four issues in the Criminal Justice Bill: the lenient sentencing in sexual offences; gang crime; the law relating to DNA evidence; and anti-social behaviour orders.</P>
      <P>The law relating to sentencing in sexual cases is unduly lenient. I have long held the view that there should be much harsher, severe and punitive sentencing for sexual offences. There is growing public alarm over leniency pertaining to sexual offences. I am disappointed that the Bill does not address this issue in a substantive manner. We are all aware of many horrific cases where exceptionally lenient sentences have been handed down for sexual offences. A recent grotesque case, that everyone is aware of, springs to mind, involving a monster, which is the best way to describe him, who went on a spree of sexual offences over a number of decades. He was given unduly lenient sentences in both this jurisdiction and the United Kingdom. I do not wish to give his name for fear of prejudicing any future serious criminal offences which might be brought in connection with his conduct.</P>
      <P>That and many other cases underline the fact that we have a serious difficulty with leniency in sexual offences. This Bill, unfortunately, missed the opportunity to deal with that issue. The principle underpinning long-term detention in our prisons is threefold: punishment and retribution in the first instance, the possibility of rehabilitation of the offender in the second and most importantly, the deterrent effect brought about through the imposition of long custodial sentences.</P>
      <P>The deterrent effect of long-term sentences is not fully appreciated, especially in so far as this relates to sexual offences. There is a deterrent as regards the offender in that it means that he or she is prevented from offending, obviously, while in prison. Others, too, are deterred from committing these extremely serious offences, I believe. In this regard society has failed women in particular. Women have been subjected to a growth in indecent assaults and serious rape in many cases only to see the offenders receive extremely lenient sentences.</P><Col N="1514"/>
      <P>Many citizens, most often young women, sometimes children, have been put through the ordeal of an horrific sexual offence because the offender is not serving a lengthy prison sentence. We ought to confront this, especially as regards premeditated sexual assault and premeditated horrific rape. People who commit premeditated rape or sexual offences should be given exceptionally long and harsh sentences. There should be mandatory sentences of minimum length. While believing in the whole concept of judicial independence, there are far too many cases of lenient sentences being meted out for such cases and the Bill fails in this regard.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome section 15 of the Bill, however, which provides for admissibility of certain witness statements. This arose out of a notorious case involving a Limerick criminal. The section provides that where a person is sent forward for trial in relation to an arrestable offence, a relevant statement made by the witness may be admitted as evidence of any fact contained in it if the witness is available for cross-examination but refuses to give evidence or denies making the statement or gives evidence which is inconsistent with it. The Leamy and Keane case in Limerick is a clearcut example of the criminal justice system being fundamentally undermined by a person making a statement to the Garda in an exceptionally serious case &mdash; the crime in this case was murder &mdash; before withdrawing it for no reasonable or conceivable reason other than to frustrate and pervert the course of justice and the outcome of the case. This was wrong and while many individuals and organisations, including the Law Society, have serious concerns about the provision in section 15 that a judge, in all the circumstances of the case and where justice requires it, may not admit such a statement, I have no difficulty with it, provided appropriate safeguards are introduced. The introduction of discretion for judges is a good safeguard.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the legislation did not deal more comprehensively with DNA related evidence. Although it includes provisions on the taking of sample evidence such as hair and saliva from an offender, I am disappointed the Bill did not go further and provide a statutory basis for establishing a badly needed statutory DNA databank. Technology is available which would not only convict criminals in serious cases, including the sexual crimes I referred to, but would also play an important role in providing potentially exculpatory evidence for defendants.</P>
      <P>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions on anti-social behaviour have been the subject of much comment and discussion. While I generally support the approach taken in the legislation, subject to the fine detail being fleshed out, I am under no illusion that it will be a panacea or cure-all for the problems of anti-social behaviour. This is a serious plague on society which is growing at a time when we have <Col N="1515"/>virtually unlimited resources to plough into deprived and socially excluded communities to address some of the problems which have affected the nation for many decades. I support anti-social behaviour orders solely on the basis that they may be an effective way of dealing with the symptoms rather than the underlying causes of the problem of anti-social behaviour. I am under no illusions that they will address the causes of this insidious behaviour which are, unfortunately, much more deeply rooted than those suggested by many commentators. I blame the planning and housing policies adopted by local authorities for many years for much of the problem. We are reaping the rewards of careless and negligent planning.</P>
      <P>The real cure for anti-social behaviour is for local authorities and communities to come together in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am pleased the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill lays down a framework within which this can take place. While anti-social behaviour orders have some place in the overall matrix of measures to deal with anti-social behaviour, they constitute only one small piece of the jigsaw. Many garda&iacute; in Limerick have told me that although they would not dream of bringing some offenders to the District Court on the basis of the activities or behaviour in which they are engaged, they would welcome an opportunity to issue them with a yellow card, as it were. Certain anti-social behaviour, when engaged in on a once-off basis, does not merit bringing an offender before the District Court but in circumstances in which an offender persistently engages in behaviour to the detriment of communities and vulnerable and elderly people, it is entirely reasonable that the Garda, at superintendent level, should be entitled to bring him or her before the District Court to be warned that his or her behaviour will come within the realm of the criminal law. That is an entirely reasonable proposition, provided appropriate safeguards are in place and I look forward to dealing in detail with such safeguards on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Although I generally welcome the legislation, opportunities were missed, particularly with regard to unduly lenient sentencing in sexual cases, an issue on which I hold strong views, and DNA evidence. The Bill offered an opportunity to lay down a statutory framework to establish a DNA database which would be helpful in the fight against crime in the years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support many of the provisions of the Bill, particularly the increase in detention periods from 12 to 24 hours and the decision to allow a chief superintendent to authorise a search without a warrant in certain circumstances. I have raised the issue of searches for years in the House only to be met by official denials that there was <Col N="1516"/>a problem in this regard. I am glad the Bill recognises that in some cases members of the Garda who are aware that a villain has stolen goods in a particular property must drive 120 or 130 miles to obtain a warrant from a District Court judge before carrying out a search. This is a practical measure which the Garda will find useful. I also support the introduction of fixed penalties for public order offences.</P>
      <P>I concur with most of Deputy Peter Power&rsquo;s comments on anti-social behaviour. They mirror the sentiments expressed by many Deputies in this debate in recent months. Members have all heard stories from garda&iacute; in recent years. My problem is that no one seems to know what is meant by community policing. Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour parties and even Sinn F&eacute;in have latched on to the idea of community policing because the message is politically highly transferable to the electorate. Everyone wants to have a cop outside the door. I doubt whether Deputies could explain what community policing will mean in the new era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights recently issued a very interesting report on community policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDeasyFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
	<P>After reading the report I was as confused as ever. A number of people, even the Minister, have come around to the idea of including local authorities in policing arrangements. While I initially supported this approach, this is no longer the case. We have missed the point with regard to the role of the Garda in community policing.</P>
      <P>I strongly disagree with the contention by a backbench Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy that the issue was about funding for the social services, the Health Service Executive, the Department of Education and Science, juvenile liaison officers and social workers in general.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is present because I have some suggestions to make on this general issue, some of which derive from my experience in recent weeks of dealing with four problem children with disastrous results. The Minister of State has made significant strides but while the overall position has improved there is a growing imbalance in this area which ties into the wider issue of community policing. I really am not sure what these organisations are doing dealing with juvenile crime in some instances. I continually come into contact with senior garda&iacute; who say that they do not have the first clue what exactly these organisations are doing, particularly in light of the amount of funding that they receive.</P>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Peter Power, everyone here seems to be coming around to the same <Col N="1517"/>viewpoint, which is that the type of community policing included in this Bill represents a panacea. I note that bolstering community policing in general is of paramount importance to everybody but I am not sure anyone really understands what that means. The catchphrases being thrown around are &ldquo;better co-ordination&rdquo;, &ldquo;more garda&iacute; on the beat&rdquo;, &ldquo;working between all the public services&rdquo;, &ldquo;multi-ethnic police forces&rdquo; and &ldquo;proper estates management&rdquo;. These are fine.</P>
      <P>Some of the legislation the House passed during the past two or three years has been commendable but some of it has merely completely confused the issue. If, for example, I table a parliamentary question asking how many people have been convicted under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003, I will receive a reply stating that the number is extremely low. Few garda&iacute; are using that legislation. Few of them are telling me that it is a useful tool in the fight against crime and the cleaning up of our streets. In large part, we have got this wrong. I agree with the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers and with their Fine Gael counterparts. There seems to be a legislative diarrhoea coming out of here in some instances which is not helping anyone out. I must state, in the strongest terms, that all it does is subvert the role of the Garda in some cases. It is confusing the issue at hand and is not making their role, as far as dealing with crime on our streets is concerned, any easier.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to make two points in that regard. Ireland has changed greatly during the past ten to 15 years. There has been a massive influx of different ethnic groups and races into the country. It was the case, even 15 years ago, that if a young garda came into a particular division, he would probably go to the local priest to find out what was happening. One cannot do that anymore. It is somewhat more complicated, particularly in urban areas. The second major difference is that parental responsibility and regard for authority have been hugely diminished. That massive change has not been mirrored by a requisite change within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The force has not really changed to match the corresponding change in society. For policemen generally, it has changed irrevocably and we have not made the requisite changes with it. I reiterate the point that this Legislature is not helping the situation. Garda&iacute; are still subject to the whim of the Minister for Finance and that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The latter is having more of a say because of the introduction of new legislation that strengthens his role in terms of consultation with the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that there was a time when community policing revolved around policemen. However, it no longer works like that. That is what has changed. As a result, the picture of community policing as we know it has become <Col N="1518"/>entirely confused. There are social workers, health board workers, council officials and housing officers. Essentially, the leadership has been taken out of community policing. Returning to the couple of situations I encountered recently, nobody wanted to take charge. Everybody knew the situation and the best actors involved were, and continue to be, garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>No one among all of the agencies dealing with particular young people of the age of 13, 14 or 15 is prepared to make the call in many cases. Nobody has been assigned the leadership duty of dealing with particular individuals. It is a mess. There are five different agencies dealing with one particular problem and no one has been assigned a leadership role in dealing with many of these cases. As a result, people give up. They just do not bother any longer. It becomes too confused. They do not know where responsibility lies and I am afraid the issue is repeatedly glossed over. People, particularly in the Garda, become terribly worked up about this because they see a particular young offender and they want to do the right thing, However, I am afraid they are being prevented from doing so in many cases.</P>
      <P>Of the many social commentators, one put it as the commensurate balance between the Garda powers and responsibilities. As I see it in my constituency, I am coming to the conclusion that we in this House have caused the confusion in many instances. We have done so with good intent in some legislation but I am afraid we have passed Bills that have sucked up much of our legislative energy as public representatives and I am not sure that the results are visible for us to see any longer. If we are moving in the direction of community policing, we need to take a step back and look at all the legislation here to see what we have or have not achieved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would not describe the Garda as a beleaguered force. As I stated, I think garda&iacute; are tired of having their role in society subverted by too much legislation. I was of the opinion that it might be a good idea for the superintendent or the chief superintendent to attend meetings of the local authorities, even on a monthly basis. I am not so sure that is such a good idea any longer. Interaction is good but the only way community policing will work is if there is an agreed structure that has garda&iacute; leading community policing efforts. That is the key element.</P>
      <P>We have turned the entire matter on its head. There was a time not that long ago when community policing, or the majority of it, rested solely with garda&iacute;. However, we have now included all of these agencies and different forces and garda&iacute; are feeling somewhat sore about the entire affair. They have gone back into their shells, as if to say &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do our jobs and you guys do yours&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, garda&iacute; are looking for a purpose. They have had some bad media, some of which was justified, in the past three or four years <Col N="1519"/>but they are upset with regard to what is happening in their communities. They are feeling sore about the influence that Government is having on them and about their role being confused, unnecessarily in some cases, when it comes to issues such as community policing. That is the only point I want to make in that regard. If one asks a garda what he or she is looking for from us, the answer will be that he or she wants more garda&iacute; and judges who have a clue about real life. In general, their needs are simple but we have, with good intent on occasion, confused the issue. If we are to pursue this idea of community policing, garda&iacute; must be the ones to mould and lead whatever structure it takes within communities without undue interference &mdash; as is currently the case &mdash; from those other agencies to which I refer.</P>
      <P>There are a couple of other issues I wish to raise. Burglary should have been included in this Bill. The recent crime figures indicate that the number of burglaries has again risen, although marginally. In my constituency, I have come to the conclusion that, because of the centralisation of Garda stations and the removal of garda&iacute;, particularly from rural areas, people are not being properly protected. Garda&iacute; cannot do that job for them because they have been centralised. In many instances, garda&iacute; no longer reside in the communities they serve. Successive Governments have tried to provide incentives to garda&iacute;, particularly young members of the force, to move into these neighbourhoods but, in general, this has not worked. Many of these neighbourhoods are devoid of a Garda presence.</P>
      <P>If the State cannot provide adequate protection to homeowners, the law must be changed to allow them to protect themselves. If that means we must allow a homeowner use force if a burglar enters his or her property, that should be considered. In many rural areas in particular the requisite police force is not available to protect them.</P>
      <P>I want to make some points with regard to community policing. I carried out a survey in the City of Waterford this year and completed it at the end of the summer. My sample was approximately 710 people from the city. I am from an area about 30 miles from the city so I was happy with that sample. I got the distinct impression from the comment box that people were dying to tell me their experience. The numbers of burglaries in Waterford city were astronomical and in many cases people&rsquo;s homes or businesses were burgled four or five times.</P>
      <P>I will give a snapshot of the position in Waterford city after three and a half years of this Government. Some people might say the questions asked in my survey are simplistic, but I do not agree. The responses give a good idea as to how unsafe people feel in one of our largest <Col N="1520"/>urban areas. Some 95% of people surveyed said they believed Waterford needs extra garda&iacute;. In response to the question of when they last saw a garda on foot in their neighbourhood, some 3% said the previous week, 14% the previous month and 59% the previous year. Some 22% said they had never seen a garda on foot in their neighbourhood. The funny thing is I did not include a box to cover the option of never; people added that themselves.</P>
      <P>When asked how they would rate the general Garda presence in their area, 2% said very good, 11% satisfactory, 31% unsatisfactory and 54% non-existent. Some 61% of people said they had no confidence in the ability of garda&iacute; to combat crime. With regard to whether garda&iacute; have adequate resources to do their job, 82% said they did not. In general, people know where the blame lies, and it is not with garda&iacute;. The people want to see more garda&iacute; in their neighbourhoods, but they do not believe they have the resources to do their jobs. Garda&iacute; do not believe it either.</P>
      <P>When asked whether they were afraid to walk in their neighbourhood at night, 58% of those surveyed said they were. Some 95% indicated they fear for their children&rsquo;s safety when they are in town at night and 68% said they were afraid of being personally assaulted. The Minister of State will love the next question and response. When asked whether they or a member of their family had been a victim of crime over the past five years, 49% said they or a member of their family had been victims. The local garda&iacute; were stunned by that figure.</P>
      <P>I asked whether anyone was convicted in respect of the crimes reported to garda&iacute;. Some 96% said there was no conviction in their case. When asked whether they had confidence in the ability of the courts to combat crime, 90% said they did not. In reply to the question as to whether our court system tackles the problem of repeat offenders, 90% do not believe it does. Some 85% of people surveyed agreed parents should be fined for offences committed by their children and 94% said the movement of young offenders should be restricted by law.</P>
      <P>A question of particular relevance to this Bill asked whether electronic tagging should be used as a substitute for prison and some 61% said it should. On the question of whether sentencing is too harsh, too lenient or about right, 90% felt it is too lenient. The response to this survey after three and a half years of this Government gives some idea of how the people of Waterford city feel about this issue.</P>
      <P>I asked a parliamentary question about two weeks ago regarding Garda figures for all the urban areas. I also raised this matter with Se&aacute;n Aylward, Secretary General of the Department. The response showed that in Dublin, the Minister&rsquo;s home base, there were 300 people per garda, but in Waterford there were 500 per garda. <Col N="1521"/>This is a significant difference. There is a massive difference between the number of garda&iacute; on the streets in Waterford versus the number on the streets of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Galway.</P>
      <P>The Department has its criteria wrong. The Minister needs to examine the formula he uses to assign members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to urban areas. I know the situation in the City of Waterford and have been told by senior officers that it will get a lot worse before it gets better. They are concerned. When I see the number of garda&iacute; available for deployment in Waterford, I am not surprised the people in Waterford city feel the way they do. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s office need to reassess the formula they use to assign numbers of garda&iacute; to urban areas.</P>
      <P>Our crime levels will continue to rise until we realise the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not bit-part players in community policing. Garda&iacute; must lead and spearhead it. They must be trusted with and given that responsibility. If a Government effort is made in that direction, the Garda will relish it. The time is right for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When this Bill was published earlier in the year, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform produced a briefing note to the office of the Government Chief Whip, which was subsequently transmitted to the party Whips of all groupings in the House. That note listed the main features of this Bill and highlighted eight bullet points with regard to what the Bill is about. Half way through the briefing note, it mentions that the Minister intends to bring forward further additions to the Bill during its passage through the House. There then follows ten bullet points.</P>
      <P>If anything describes the <i>ad hoc</i> nature of how legislation is processed through the House, it is the presentation of a Bill that is followed by a briefing, followed by a debate from which a whole new Bill results. I suspect that when the Bill eventually goes to Committee Stage, we will see further bullet points emanating from the Minister&rsquo;s imagination. I will give the Minister of State some benefit of the doubt if he wants to put his&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Bullet points up as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed. I expect we will see even more on Report Stage. When we look at the highlights as presented in the original briefing note we can, perhaps, understand why the Minister wanted to introduce a different or sexier Bill. The original highlights are on the dry side. The Bill calls for a statutory power to preserve a crime scene. It is surprising that is not already a statutory power. It is an uncontentious matter to be bringing before the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill also seeks a general power with regard to the issue of search warrants. It is well known <Col N="1522"/>that many prosecutions have failed &mdash; perhaps far too many &mdash; because of the bad application of search warrants. I fear we may entrench bad practice by making the practice easier rather than enforcing the high standards that should already exist. The Bill calls for increased detention powers of up to 24 hours for arrestable offences, namely offences that are punishable by sentences of five years or more. This has civil liberty implications. Not only that, there are already provisions on the Statute Book with regard to anti-terrorist legislation that should the Garda require it and hold people in detention for long periods, they can describe the offence as a terrorist offence rather than resort to a provision such as this.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to make some amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990. In particular, it proposes to reclassify saliva and mouth swabs as samples for which consent is not required. Perhaps we are moving into more interesting territory. There may be civil liberties implications. It depends on the degree of force used in seeking such samples. I do not think there is any degree of large-scale dissent about making evidence of this nature as easily available as possible and loosening the law in this regard.</P>
      <P>The legislation before the House will extend the power of the prosecution to make an appeal in certain limited circumstances, for example if points of law are at stake. The Statute Book already provides for an ability to appeal the severity of a sentence. While the extension of this provision to cover points of law might be interesting for barristers and solicitors, the extent to which it would change this country&rsquo;s general sentencing policy has yet to be proved. The Bill includes some general provisions, mostly of a technical nature, which it is claimed will improve the efficiency of the prosecution of offences. That claim pretty much sums up the original intent of the Bill. The legislation will provide for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences. It will amend the Firearms Acts to alter the requirements of applicants for firearms certificates.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about the second category of bullet points, which outline the Minister&rsquo;s subsequent proposals. It is clear the Minister&rsquo;s imagination has gone into overdrive in this instance. It is obvious he has highlighted the points he thinks will attract the most interest among the media and the public, in terms of politics in general. The Minister has outlined the Bill&rsquo;s intention to deal with participation in criminal organisations. The Bill does not specify political parties in that regard. The Minister has spoken about the proposal in the Bill to strengthen sentencing provisions for drug trafficking and firearms offences. He also intends to provide in the Bill for the electronic tagging of offenders. The Bill will provide for the new <Col N="1523"/>offence of the possession of an article with intent to commit certain offences, although it does not specify whether it is a definite or an indefinite article. It has been suggested that further amendments will be made to the sections of the Firearms Acts concerning the control of firearms. A statutory committee will be established to oversee the process of codification of all substantive law. The Minister must be really serious if he is establishing a statutory committee.</P>
      <P>The Bill will provide for some new offences of supplying drugs to prisoners. The Minister&rsquo;s response to the problem of drug-taking, which has been a feature of the prison system for a long time, has been to introduce a new offence. There has been very little evidence during the Minister&rsquo;s tenure that the supply of drugs in our prisons can be better disturbed or controlled. Many prisoners originally became addicted to drugs while in prison. There are not enough support services to help to wean prisoners off their addictions. We need to put services in place to help people to get rid of their addictions after they finish their prison sentences. I would accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides in this regard if he showed more serious intent and provided more resources.</P>
      <P>The big selling point of the new Bill that will be before the House after the amendments are made will be the new provisions for dealing with anti-social behaviour. I refer to the anti-social behaviour orders which have operated in the United Kingdom in recent years. Although such orders seem to be quite unsuccessful there, the Minister feels the need to introduce them here. He has argued that they will not be applied in the same way here &mdash; he does not propose to give local authorities the power to issue anti-social behaviour orders. I do not understand how the existence of such orders will lessen the existence of anti-social behaviour or ameliorate such behaviour. There has not been any evidence in the UK that the orders have such effects.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister has not explained how he intends to avoid the ridiculous use of anti-social behaviour orders, which has been a feature of the system in all parts of the UK, including Northern Ireland. When the orders were introduced in Northern Ireland a few months ago, the first one to be issued on behalf of a local authority was issued on foot of a complaint made by a person against his neighbour who was playing records or CDs too loud. When one starts to introduce quasi-judicial measures which give the appearance of public involvement in the justice system, one creates a justice system that is noted for freakish decisions and occurrences. The Minister might be keen to stray into that territory, but it does not do anything for the majesty of the law. The House should not encourage the Minister&rsquo;s inclinations in this regard by passing legislation of this nature.</P><Col N="1524"/>
      <P>The Minister has outlined his intention to give the courts the right to suspend or partially suspend sentences to motivate offenders to stay away from crime. The courts will also be able to adjourn to deal with issues which give rise to the offences. I welcome these measures, which are among the more liberal outlined in the new bullet points. If the Minister is really serious about the measures, why is the probation and welfare service so poorly resourced? Why are community service orders so rarely used? If the two measures are taken on board to the extent that they should be, there will not be a need for the new provisions in the Bill. The Minister has also proposed the establishment of a register of drug offenders. He has also outlined his intention to increase significantly the penalties for the illegal importation, sale or use of fireworks. It seems that he is keen to go out with a bang.</P>
      <P>When speaking during the Second Stage debate on a criminal justice Bill, we need to consider first principles. Although he is an eminent barrister who has practised for many years, I am not convinced the Minister is fully in tune with what our justice system should be about. The philosophy that underpins his version of the system seems to relate more to retribution and revenge than to atonement and rehabilitation. He has not addressed the central questions. If our prison system is working, why is the rate of recidivism so high? Why do so many of those who enter the prison system commit further crimes? If prison is such a deterrent, why do we have high levels of crime in our society? If we have put in place so many serious measures to discourage people from committing crime, why is the nature of crime changing in our society? There has been a swing away from crimes against property to crimes against the person.</P>
      <P>I refer in particular to drug offences. There has been a great deal of discussion about the possibility of establishing a register of drug offenders. The appropriate balance that should exist within our justice system should be articulated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is a need for support structures to assist those who are drug offenders because they have an addiction and are trapped in a cycle of drug use, misuse and abuse. I will continue to look on measures such as this Bill with a jaundiced eye until I hear the Minister speaking more articulately about such issues.</P>
      <P>The existence of anti-social behaviour is not just a media phenomenon. My Green Party colleague in Cork, Councillor Chris O&rsquo;Leary, has been a victim of such behaviour in his local community. When he tried to take appropriate steps as a citizen to address that behaviour, he encountered various barriers. The Garda at local level is not as co-operative as it could be, for example by involving other people, identifying anti-social behaviour and nipping it in the bud, ensuring that <Col N="1525"/>appropriate systems of diversion are available and putting in place rewards for appropriate behaviour, where appropriate, in communities where anti-social behaviour is most prevalent. The Government does not have an integrated policy in this regard. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has some role in this respect. His office was established as part of an attempt to ensure there is co-ordination and integration between the Departments which should be involved in this area. I refer in particular to the need to ensure that young people are diverted from crime. The Minister of State might not be prepared to admit that the level of funding allocated to this area remains quite small, unfortunately, when compared to the overall level of Government spending. Such funding will have limited success because it is just a drop in the ocean in communities with a substantial level of need. We tend to approach many of these issues as if we were running up a hill backwards because there is a lack of political will to address seriously issues which are politically unpopular. If we are to appropriately address many of these issues and the communities concerned, it will mean making political choices that could ultimately lose votes for politicians and political parties because the decisions that need to be made and the resources that must be allocated mean in some sense acknowledging, through the use of taxpayer&rsquo;s money, the need for investment in areas where that money may not be spent as effectively as it could be in the short term. Medium-term and long-term decisions must be made. Rather than posturing on the issue, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform often seems to do, it would be more in order for the House to do its job effectively and address public concerns in this area through a more consensual approach. Unfortunately, crime seems to be an issue on which, at one level &mdash; through media reportage &mdash; one can make a lot of noise, produce sexy copy or introduce the degree of scaremongering that makes people feel ill at ease with themselves and the communities in which they live. That is not a responsible way for a political system, never mind an individual politician, to behave in regard to issues of this type.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The briefing concludes by trying to imply that the Criminal Justice Bill is part of a co-ordinated legislative programme being introduced by the Minister. However, as he seems to have three mad ideas before breakfast every day, I do not know how he can have a co-ordinated approach to any legislative programme. We know there will be new ideas in this Bill and that new Bills will be introduced in whatever remains in the lifetime of this D&aacute;il. To suggest that this Bill is similar to the legislation that dealt with interview techniques, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill or the Independent Garda Ombudsman Bill is to miss the point. We know <Col N="1526"/>from the issues that have arisen in, for example, Donegal that all is not well with how decisions in regard to policing are made and how individual citizens are affected by such policing. We should not run away from the consequences of this.</P>
      <P>Administrative problems further undermine the fight, such as it is, against crime. Initiatives have been introduced, such as community policing in rural and urban areas. As a Deputy representing a constituency with a fair mix &mdash; it is largely urban and suburban, with a rural component &mdash; I have experience of how these schemes operate ten or 15 years after their introduction. I can identify a number of reasons public involvement in the prevention of crime has not been as successful as previously. For example, as community police officers must change Garda stations on too regular a basis, it is difficult for them to establish and maintain relations with people in particular communities. Moreover, many of the support structures, such as road signs and stickers on doors and windows, were issued ten or 15 years ago. The road signs are broken or have become covered in moss, the stickers in the windows have faded and any idea of community cohesion in regard to many of these projects has disappeared.</P>
      <P>If we were serious about addressing the problems of crime in a co-ordinated way, we would deal with the economic and social realities for the communities where crime is most predominant and the generations in which crime is most prevalent. Older people have a fear of being victims of crime and some older people are victims of crime. However, we must remember that not only are the majority of the perpetrators of crime young but also that the victims of crime in the majority of circumstances are young.</P>
      <P>This brings us back to the Minister&rsquo;s situation and his effort to be some sort of bulwark by introducing a co-ordinated approach to these issues. As one with experience in youth and community work, I find it frustrating that, after 20 years, the only suggested response from Government is the traditional approach &mdash; the &ldquo;hard man&rdquo; or &ldquo;birch them and lock them up&rdquo; approach &mdash; and that many of the provisions in the Children Act and the Youth Work Acts remain unimplemented. This is despite the fact an alternative exists. With a small amount of political will and an appropriate amount of resources, there would not be a need to introduce legislation of this type. This is the saddest aspect of the legislative programme introduced by the Minister. I have only a forlorn hope that by the end of the lifetime of this D&aacute;il we may see the Minister as a different animal, namely, one who has had a Pauline conversion about what he believes and about how we can change the nature of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the foundation of the State, crime and criminality have never been far off the <Col N="1527"/>agenda. In the coming year, one will have to welcome the fact that a generation will grow up without the State being under threat from paramilitary or other types of organisations. This gives the State a wonderful opportunity to concentrate on criminality which, until now, may have flown under the radar as scarce Garda resources were directed to other areas. However, this opportunity needs to be grasped with both hands and not in a piecemeal way, as under the Criminal Justice Bill. We do not want another opportunity to be wasted. I am convinced that we have lost many opportunities during the past seven or eight years. These were years of opportunity,when the country could have gained by making changes. While we did not achieve those changes, I hope we will do so in the next couple of years. However, piecemeal legislation will not achieve real change or results.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is seldom since the foundation of the State that the ministry in charge of justice affairs seemed less important than the Minister who was running the Department. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has become notorious for press releases and announcements based on little except that the Minister wanted to be heard. Later, many of these announcements and press releases came to mean nothing. There has been no action, no results and no change. For example, despite promises in respect of 2,000 extra garda&iacute; and a zero tolerance policy, there has been no change. There was a major media announcement of a new traffic corps, which involved Garda vans, motorcycles and colourful lights and sirens. Some changes took place, some more flashy cars appeared on the roads but no real results occurred. However, day after day people are being needlessly killed on our roads. It is becoming more difficult to go to the funerals of friends and to see their families suffer needlessly due to inaction across a number of Departments. The traffic corps is not the only answer but we need changes and action across the board, not just announcements and glitzy advertisements. We need real change, which we are not getting. While there was a further media announcement on reserve forces and privately operated cameras were discussed, no change has resulted.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>I realise that some of these issues stretch across different Departments. However, that is not an excuse for not implementing them. The Bill is another opportunity to discuss crime while not really discussing solutions to the problem and to make small changes and fiddle with legislation without debating what needs to be done to make things better, reduce crime and make safer the lives of members of the public. While one must recognise the need for the Bill, which is long overdue, it has been highlighted that the Members spend their time playing catch-up, reacting to rather than set<Col N="1528"/>ting the agenda. This means the Bill will be outdated before it is even enacted. One has to start somewhere but I would like to have a proper debate that will bring about changes and make a difference outside the House.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P Just="Left">I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il for three years but I cannot think of four or five Bills that have improved the lives of the people. All Bills are important in their own right as certain elements must be changed or brought into line. However, they do not make a difference. The Minister is in a position to make real changes. It is a shame his talent is going to waste and is not being properly directed. He is more concerned with making announcements to the media. A simple example was the plan to tackle bicycle theft. This should have been quietly put in place. The Minister should have issued an instruction to those in charge that he wanted a reduction in bicycle theft and should have provided the funding but that is not what happened. There was a big media announcement that there was a plan to reduce bicycle theft. Everyone was told how easy it was to rob a bicycle and the number of bicycle robberies increased by 58% as a result. That is a simple example but it proves the point I make.</P>
      <P>For the criminal justice system to be successful it must have the co-operation and hold the faith of the people. Garda&iacute; have traditionally been held in high esteem, with respect for the uniform to the fore. In recent years, however, that esteem has sadly been eroded to some extent due to circumstances of which the Government should have been in control but which have now taken on a life of their own. This is the first issue the Criminal Justice Bill should have tackled comprehensively. When root and branch changes were needed in the RUC, the Patten report was compiled. It set out a blueprint for the future. While the Northern peace process has a long way to go, the Patten report clearly defined the steps such reform would allow if brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Boyle said, the Minister has claimed that this legislation is part of a co-ordinated legislative programme. I do not believe that to be the case. If it is, however, where is the blueprint and the research behind the legislative programme that will bring about all these changes? On what is this Bill, and all the other Bills that will be introduced, based? What is the logic behind them? As my colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, stated earlier this year in respect of the Bill:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Minister announced in his speech that he has major plans to amend heavily the Bill as initiated. [He must really be coming from a sound basis if that is the case.] I went through his speech and I found he had nine bullet points that were included in the Bill along with a further 11 bullet points that are currently only in his mind. Yet we are supposed to debate <Col N="1529"/>these issues today, despite the fact that they are not included in the Bill.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In the interim, we have managed to get some of these ideas out of the Minister&rsquo;s head and into the public domain. One involves increased sentences for drug trafficking. At present there is a mandatory sentence of ten years. If I am correct, in more than 80% of cases individuals receive fewer than ten-year sentences. Some only get one, two or five years in prison. That is grand if the judges believe it is right and if society accepts that because prison is not always the answer. However, if a sentence of ten years is prescribed in law and if it is not being imposed, the law must be wrong. Perhaps the sentence should be two or five years. I do not know but the law currently stipulates a sentence of ten years but no one is enforcing it or it is only been enforced in very few cases.</P>
      <P>If the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is working to or from a masterplan or a blueprint, how is it possible that the Minister can have all these ideas in his head and not on the table for discussion? How is it that this legislation needs so many amendments and changes even before the ink is dry? If we could see the masterplan behind it, then surely these changes would not be needed or recommended and we could debate them properly. The Minister spoke of tagging criminals. That idea might work and be good but it should be included in this legislation so that we can discuss it properly. The Bill was introduced even before the committee finished its deliberations on community policing and so on because the Minister wanted to make another announcement on legislation he proposed to introduce.</P>
      <P>It appears to me and many of my colleagues that this legislation has more to do with the personality of the Minister than to the root and branch reform it proposes to tackle. If I am wrong, show me the blueprint and from where all these ideas are coming? It is almost certain that parts of this Bill are, and will remain, unworkable until they are scrutinised in a proper, professional way before they are enacted. We talk of fixed charge amounts. I have no idea what the amounts will be, how they will be administered and the list of offences to which they will apply. There are many ways to define &ldquo;public disorder&rdquo;. I agree that it needs to be tackled but it is not clear how this will be done. It is open to interpretation and is a grey area open to abuse. The Garda needs powers to enable it to act. Further grey areas are not required. Every second garda will have a different interpretation of it.</P>
      <P>Ireland has moved on from a situation where priests and police could not be questioned and where dark secrets could easily be locked away in closets so prying eyes could not see the truth. This is welcome but to gain respect in this modern age, one must earn it through action and not only <Col N="1530"/>words. The first failing of the Bill is its wording which might suit the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues in the Law Library but which does nothing for me or for the many people to whom I spoke on the doorsteps when I tried to explain the Criminal Justice Bill, which has been hanging around here for the past number of months. I found it difficult to sum up the Bill, to explain to people what it contains and to say how it will change things. After repeated readings of this Bill, it is still difficult to grasp what it is meant to achieve.</P>
      <P>Many of us know exactly from where we are starting in regard to criminal justice &mdash; I am sure the Minister does too if he would only tell us &mdash; and have some idea where we would like to finish but we are confused by the bit in the middle, that is, Bills such as this. This Bill is strong on rhetoric and on terms which could mean different things to different people. It is low on setting standards and targets for achievement and it seems to be legislation for the sake of it. In plain English, it means a job not completed. It is another part but there is no end result.</P>
      <P>It has often been said that good legislation reflects the society it is deemed to serve. Good legislation takes on board the mistakes of the past and the experiences of others who have dealt with problems in different ways. Clearly this legislation is found lacking in these areas. The society in which we live is fast changing, is more cosmopolitan and is moving from a rural to a more urban environment in which people are forced to live closer together and in which modern technology makes crimes relatively easy to perform. These changes are not factored into the Bill.</P>
      <P>High density populations need more visible security. In 1996 my home town of Navan used to have one garda for every 270 people. Now it has only one garda for every 410 residents. How does this reflect the multicultural town of Navan, which has three times the population it had ten years ago? In 1983, Navan had more garda&iacute; than it has now. The population then was under 10,000 but it is now heading for 30,000. Some 23 years on, we have gone backwards. Again, this Bill will not solve a thing. I know that a legislative programme is supposed to be brought forward but I wonder where it is and where the Minister is to defend it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">More fundamental root and branch reforms such as adding to the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na need to be addressed with the introduction of a Bill of this nature. I referred earlier to the reserve force. Perhaps tougher penalties for road traffic offences are needed. It is time we got real in regard to road traffic offences. One way or the other, we must resolve the problem. Someone in Government should decide to do so with a team of civil servants or whatever. However, no one in this or in any previous Government has said they will resolve it. It is time someone decided to do so whether it is done under the Department of <Col N="1531"/>Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Department of Transport. It does not bother me who resolves the problem but it must be tackled. We should spend time discussing such issues rather than Bills of this sort.</P>
      <P>In this modern era, legislation such as this should clearly define the role of our new policing service and supply a yardstick by which it can be measured. Without this, sadly, those who attempt to work the system can never be sure if what they are doing is right. For those of us whose job it is to monitor the system, the task is just as difficult. What are we to measure it against? How are we supposed to interpret the Bill? I have asked garda&iacute; about it but they are not sure what it involves, what changes will be made, how these will affect their work and how they are supposed to decide on whom to impose a fixed charge. We do not even know if a fixed charge will stay on someone&rsquo;s record. Will people have criminal records? Perhaps we could look at penalty points rather than impose fines of &euro;80. In light of the way people drive on our roads, I do not believe an &euro;80 fine scares them. I am not sure it works and, therefore, a system of penalty points for public disorder should be considered. It might be a better deterrent than anti-social behaviour orders or prison sentences. It will give an opportunity at an early stage to identify an individual who is at risk of heading for a life of crime. If, say, 12 penalty points is the maximum, and an individual reaches six, signals would go off for society to intervene before it is too late.</P>
      <P>With the number of murders and serious crimes involving illegally held arms increasing and showing no signs of abating, special provisions are needed. Mandatory life sentences must be the norm for the perpetrators of such crimes. Mandatory life sentences for those caught in possession, giving sanctuary or hiding illegally held arms must be introduced without delay. The word must go out that firearms held illegally have no place in our country. Anyone who deals in or is in possession of firearms has no place in society. No mercy must be shown to those who knowingly possess such items and use them to keep their illegal activities going. A gun may make a small man big. Take away his gun and he is still only a small man.</P>
      <P>It is time armed criminals learnt to respect, and to fear, the law. While such a Bill has the potential to do this, as this Bill stands, it cannot achieve this. A car is also a deadly weapon. Everyone assumes he or she has the right to drive one as he or she likes. It must be a privilege not a right to drive a car. It must be a privilege that must be earned, where an individual&rsquo;s training is monitored and assessed properly. I apologise for returning to the matter of cars but this morning I attended another funeral of a 19 year old, another unnecessary loss of life and tragic circumstances <Col N="1532"/>for a family. A Bill such as this offers us an opportunity to debate solutions to these issues.</P>
      <P>Another high profile criminal activity, occurring on a daily basis and involving the robbery of multimillions of euro, is what some would describe as daring schemes to get rich quick. The people involved in these robberies have no particular skills but operate with inside knowledge and the blessing of the authorities. This crime has become the norm, leaving ordinary decent people as victims. The taxpayer is demanding it is stopped. To prevent such crimes happening, one does not have to tighten post office or bank security, no big media announcements have to be made, no extra garda&iacute; need to be employed, the Army&rsquo;s size does not need to be increased or more advanced security vans or more closed circuit television introduced. All that has to be done to stop millions of euro walking from each Department on a weekly basis and robbed from the people, is for the lugs who hire consultants, needlessly, too frequently and with an open cheque book to be sacked.</P>
      <P>Wasting money is a criminal offence for which someone must be accountable. To describe &euro;150 million as small change is an insult to any decent person. It is codswallop when the Taoiseach says the tragic death of Mr. Patrick Walsh in Monaghan had nothing to do with resources. Again, it is another crime. Small change of &euro;150 million would have gone a long way to putting two nurses in Monaghan Hospital, if that is all that was needed for Mr. Walsh to have his operation and prevent his unnecessary death. It is a matter of resources. It will take more resources to tackle crime. However, this Bill deals only with small changes to legislation without bringing about real change, another wasted opportunity. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will introduce Bills that will make a difference. However, I do not believe he will as he has not done so in three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to examine the multifaceted area of crime. Crime has many contributory factors and must be examined more deeply than in the past. It is an area where resources, not just for the Garda, must be provided.</P>
      <P>Education is a factor where resources need to be provided. Significant numbers of our young people are educated in classes which are unmanageable. In south Tipperary, a recent survey carried out by the INTO indicated approximately one third of primary schoolchildren were in classes of over 30 pupils. A significant number were in classes with over 35 pupils. Last week I was informed by parents of a second class in the St. Peter and Paul national school in Clonmel with 39 children. In a senior infants class in the same school, there are 35 children. These <Col N="1533"/>numbers are unmanageable. It is an early indication that difficulties will emerge if the education system cannot look after our young people.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of what the Government has told us over the last several years, in real terms spending on education has fallen during the Government&rsquo;s term. Ireland is 19th of the 26 OECD countries in terms of spending in education. One reply we will always receive is that funding is a big problem and where can it be secured. In a reply to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister for Finance informed me that from 1998 to 2004, the budget surplus, that is income over day-to-day expenditure, was &euro;34.5 billion. That does not indicate a lack of sources for funding. What has been done with this funding? It has largely been spent on roads, bridges and broadband and not on human services like education, health, social welfare and Garda resources. Every other half wealthy European country funds capital projects like roads, bridges and broadband out of capital expenditure, by borrowing. It makes good economic sense. Anything else is an anti-human policy, whereby we unnecessarily starve those human services such as education, health, social welfare, housing and Garda resources of money to build roads and bridges. We can borrow prudently, well within European guidelines, to build that infrastructure. The most important infrastructure in any country is a healthy, well-housed, well-educated population.</P>
      <P>Arguments are made that previously we nearly bankrupted the country by borrowing. That did happen but it was because Fianna F&aacute;il borrowed for ordinary expenditure and that is very different. I call on this Government to put the resources available in its huge surpluses, some &euro;7 billion on the current account this year, into human services like health, education, housing, social welfare and Garda resources. Human beings need those services. If we want to rid society of criminality those services must be funded. We are in the happy position of being able to do that and build our infrastructure as well but for some reason this Government wants to fund capital expenditure out of current revenue. That is bad economics, bad social policy and anti-human.</P>
      <P Just="Left">After adopting the fundamental policy of putting resources into human services we should tackle crime properly by allocating specific Garda resources with particular facilities for certain areas. We were told there would be 2,000 additional garda&iacute; in the programme for Government. This is 2005 and we have still not seen them. We will go into the next election without seeing them. There is no commitment on the part of this Government to put resources into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Until three years ago there were three garda&iacute; in Fethard in my constituency. One retired on health grounds and was never replaced. In Clonmel, a town of 20,000 people <Col N="1534"/>with a hinterland of 10,000 more, there are 39 garda&iacute; of all grades. Based on a 24 hour service the maximum on duty will be eight and that does not take into account sick leave or annual leave. There are approximately six garda&iacute; on duty to serve a town of 20,000 and a hinterland of 10,000. Is anybody suggesting that level of Garda manpower is adequate to cover a town of that size? Nobody with common sense would suggest that was adequate.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of resources, many towns have asked for closed circuit television. Clonmel looked for it four years ago. I raise it here on a regular basis as do my constituency colleagues and other local elected representatives. We get the usual reply that it is in the system and will be delivered once the funding is there. That funding might be in two, three or four years&rsquo; time. Effectively there is no programme for rolling out closed circuit television.</P>
      <P>The Garda radio system deters people from reporting crime. Constituents have told me they will not report something to the Garda because people can listen in to the system, so poor is it. They will know that S&eacute;amus Healy or someone else rang the garda&iacute;. They would be targeted as a result. It is totally archaic and deters ordinary decent people from reporting crime.</P>
      <P>Rural Garda stations such as in my area have also suffered from a reduction in personnel and resources over the years. The exact opposite has happened in the criminal fraternity. They have the resources to be available in Dublin or 100 or 200 miles from Dublin in a matter of hours. There are fewer Garda resources in rural areas than in the past. That has given rise to huge difficulties in local rural areas because gangs from the bigger cities and major towns raid those areas with impunity. The money is available to put proper resources into funding Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the facilities and equipment they require. This Government should make a decision to do that. I cannot understand why they do not do it.</P>
      <P>I become frustrated by the subject of community garda&iacute; as I and others have been pursuing the issue for a number of years. I recall a number of years ago going to Waterford city, and I have heard a Deputy extol the virtues of community garda&iacute; in that city. The system available in Waterford worked well, as it liaised with local communities and young people. It spotted difficult young people at an early stage and brought them into line, ensuring they availed of various facilities available. It is a service that can break the cycle of crime.</P>
      <P>In my constituency there are no dedicated community garda&iacute;. The same is true for a number of other constituencies. I have spoken with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na locally, and they have, with the RAPID organisation which covers part of my constituency, along with local public representatives and local Members, recommended the <Col N="1535"/>appointment of community garda&iacute; in south Tipperary. They have not had success. Indeed, there was a spectacle earlier this year when a superintendent from outside the constituency told the Minister that the area did not require community garda&iacute;. I would like that superintendent to live in any of the major towns in my constituency, or other constituencies, and see for himself the requirement for community garda&iacute;. There is no doubt in my mind that early intervention by garda&iacute; dedicated to working in the community with local young people can do Trojan work in breaking the cycle of crime, particularly in larger towns and cities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This leads to the area of anti-social behaviour, which I will briefly discuss. Community garda&iacute; are essential if anti-social behaviour is to be dealt with. Nobody wants to highlight anti-social behaviour in his or her own town, street or State, but it exists, unfortunately. It occurs every weekend, and local people are being abused and threatened by small groups of people who could be dealt with by a combination of proper education, community garda&iacute; and the provision of facilities within estates and communities. They would also be helped by proper architectural design of particular estates. We should look at the way estates were built in the past and are still being built to some extent. Input should be received from local community garda&iacute; on the planning of estates.</P>
      <P>I have addressed the issue of the inquiry into the tragic death of Brian Rossiter to the Minister in the past by means of parliamentary question and statement. The inquiry put in place by the Minister is inadequate in dealing with that case. Everybody involved, including the Garda, would like to see a fully comprehensive and transparent inquiry, set up properly under recent legislation. It should have extended terms of reference to ensure the tragic situation is properly dealt with, properly reported, and the report made widely available to the public in order to clear the air of the tragic occurrence in Clonmel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to speak on this Bill and it is an important subject. &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; tonight will discuss the case of a Donegal taximan who was killed by a car driven by a young man who had been seen drinking earlier that night. Although the young man was subsequently apprehended, he was not breathalysed. This is indicative of the types of situation occurring within our laws that are very wrong. I have much respect for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its work, but past and ongoing cases such as the Donegal example highlight where the law is not upheld. With regard to the case on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; tonight, <Col N="1536"/>I wrote to the DPP asking why the young man was not breathalysed even though he had been seen in a disco drinking that evening before the unfortunate taximan was mowed down, leaving a wife and young family behind him. These cases should be addressed.</P>
      <P>It often appears that two laws exist, one for the less powerful people on the ground and another for richer or more powerful people. In rural areas, we often have difficulty getting enough garda&iacute; to patrol an area. However, there is currently no shortage of garda&iacute; in Rossport, County Mayo. When Advantica was sent there to carry out an assessment on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, there were around 60 garda&iacute; in the area. The members of the company were amazed to find the locals were reasonable, law abiding citizens who were engaging in a peaceful protest and they could not understand how the services of 60 garda&iacute; were required. There has been spin by Shell to insinuate that these people were other than law abiding citizens. Having visited those men in jail during their 94 day stay, it was useful to see what an excellent prison service we have and how hard the officers work, often without the support they need from the Government. It is hard to understand how the Rossport five were in jail for 94 days when we consider that Shell, after 79 days, is only beginning to take apart the pipeline that it illegally constructed. As the laws of the land favour the rich and powerful, Shell was able to be in contempt of the ministerial order for 79 days. Those brave men were imprisoned for 94 days and are back in court again tomorrow.</P>
      <P>This is a society that would deprive people of adequate numbers of garda&iacute;. The Government does not promote balanced regional development, but ensures people fill the urban areas and does not then provide them with the supports that they need in those areas. The Government then makes much noise about anti-social behaviour orders. Instead of giving young people the supports and services that are needed to control anti-social behaviour, orders are enforced which criminalise acts which are anti-social but not criminal. In turn, these young people end up with a criminal record, are brought into the system and castigated as criminals. They are stigmatised and this cannot be right.</P>
      <P>So much money has been wasted. In my area, we are still looking for basic services. Some years ago, the Government gave the Garda a helicopter to assist in the fight against crime. When the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Nora Owen, granted the provision of this service, she made the point that it was for garda&iacute; to identify the perpetrators of crime on the spot. Yet in this country, people have died on the side of the road giving birth to children for lack of services in their own area. A man with a bleeding ulcer <Col N="1537"/>died because there was no service available in his own hospital. Hospitals are being downgraded and are being deprived of the facilities they need to provide an adequate service. A reputable group such as the Royal College of Surgeons will then state that such a hospital in not providing services according to essential standards. What choice does this organisation have when the Government deprives the local hospital of the services it needs?</P>
      <P>A report was published some time ago stating a helicopter emergency medical service was essential and should be rolled out on a North-South basis, yet the service is still being denied to the people. People such as this gentleman are ill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Money is being spent on things that are not really to the benefit of society. It should not be spent on punishing people to cure problems that relate to a lack of social services in an area. The justice system is there to provide that. It is absolutely essential that garda&iacute; are provided in both rural and urban areas, but with rural depopulation, people have moved into the larger centres and urban areas have increased dramatically without an increase in Garda numbers. Rural areas are being deprived of essential services such as Garda stations, which are necessary for the fabric of an area. There was a great camaraderie in rural areas when everyone knew the local garda, as well as a great respect for the law. Locals could always identify the garda as a friend, but people now only meet garda&iacute; when trouble arises so they form a perception that the garda&iacute; mean trouble. Anti-social behaviour orders will compound this. A much better approach would be a contract with a person to behave in a certain way, rather than criminalising the person.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The value of the Garda in the community cannot be over-emphasised. We have seen too often that this has not happened. Other services in rural areas include housing. Many people come to my clinics looking for housing which is just not available. There are many voluntary housing associations that could provide these houses. Living in hostels is not conducive to any type of stable family life. This problem has been compounded in urban areas where so many people are homeless, particularly single people. There is no reason the voluntary sector could not get involved in this. I do not know why the Government always favours anything to do with those who make profit. Unless someone in the private sector is making money out a service, the Government does not seem to favour the service. There is a great resource of people in the community. The voluntary effort has been exemplified by the group water <Col N="1538"/>schemes, put together by people all over Ireland. It shows the value and potential of community.</P>

      <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>allow qualified professionals, other than but including vets, to issue prescriptions;</P>
      <P el="5"><?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>implement a regulation similar to that of the UK authorities, which will eradicate the potential for cross-Border trade in animal remedies;</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="10">On 10 August, the Department of Agriculture and Food published draft regulations on the issuing of animal remedies. Many believe the proposal highlights the Government&rsquo;s blatant disregard for Ireland&rsquo;s food industry. The Government is more interested in attracting transient foreign investment than in supporting indigenous employers. Sadly, this view has been copper-fastened by the publication earlier this year of the enterprise strategy action plan, the blueprint which will guide the development of Irish enterprise for at least the next ten years. It made no mention of our agrifood industry, the gross value of which to the economy is estimated to be more than &euro;11 billion per annum.</P>
      <P>Currently, red tape is strangling many farmers. It is no wonder that producers are losing confidence in a Government and a Minister for Agriculture and Food who have failed to realise the significance of the continual and persistent over-regulation which has a serious impact upon the competitiveness of our food industry. Over the last ten years, half of our abattoirs have gone out of business. Others in this sector are considering their future due to the shifting sands of regulation, which continually require expensive re-investment to meet existing food standards. This is further compounded by proposals to ban the sale of meat from butchers into the catering industry, the backbone of the business of small processors.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is now vital that the Government reviews the array of new rules and their associated costs before we price our food sector out of business. Since 2002, the Government has introduced an array of stealth taxes which have facilitated massive increases in charges for services such as elec<Col N="1540"/>tricity prices, motor charges, VAT and VHI that are essential to the farming community. At the same time, farmers do not even get the basic cost of production back from the marketplace. This is at least partially caused by the undercutting of our food by cheap imports. Stealth taxes which increase the cost of production in Ireland are facilitating the importation of more and more produce from third countries, compounding the problem. As if this was not bad enough, veterinary expenses are now 44% more expensive than they were ten years ago. The Government seems intent on squeezing farmers&rsquo; pockets even more by introducing further restrictions allowing only veterinary surgeons to issue prescriptions for animal medicines.</P>
      <P>For many, the Minister for Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s interpretation of EU Directive 2004/28, which will implement the new animal medicine regime, is the final straw. According to the directive, the definition of a veterinary prescription is any prescription for a veterinary medicinal product issued by a professional person who is qualified to do so in accordance with applicable national law. It is thus the responsibility of each member state to designate who is qualified to prescribe different medicines. Under the terms of the directive, it is possible for Ireland to maintain its current system, which is a model for the rest of Europe and has gained Irish farmers an international reputation as high quality food producers.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has stated that these new rules will not come into force until 2007, this is not correct. From the end of this month intramammary products will only be available from a veterinary practitioner. This will have a significant impact on the cost of these vital treatments. Furthermore, the prescription only medicine exempt category, which allows pharmacists and veterinary practitioners to prescribe designated animal remedies, will be abolished immediately. This will mean that some treatments such as vaccines and immunological and non-immunological products, which had been available without prescription, will now only be available from a veterinary practitioner on prescription. This is deceptive and contrary to comments which have been made to date by the Minister on the regulation and the implementation timeframe.</P>
      <P>It should also be pointed out that the prescription only medicine directive was opposed tooth and nail by the Government through two readings in the European Parliament and Council of Ministers. The then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, was browbeaten into accepting the prescription only medicine directive as part of a wider compromise package agreed by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Under pressure, Deputy Walsh agreed to sacrifice our hard won system of veterinary medicine prescription in the interests of sec<Col N="1541"/>uring a deal on the human medicines directive and regulation, which was seen as a priority for the Italian Presidency.</P>
      <P>The same Department of Agriculture and Food which now puts forward these proposals was vehemently opposed to this directive at the time of its final sign-off as a last minute achievement of the Italian Presidency. Its about turn on the likelihood of securing exemptions is both mind-boggling and inexplicable.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to create a false sense of security by gambling that the Commission will grant exemptions from the prescription requirement to all of the products that are currently available from licensed merchants. Currently, there is no EU-wide definition of a veterinary prescription and no common procedure for dispensing such a prescription. The implications of these differing approaches will become clear when the Commission&rsquo;s standing committee convenes to draft this list of exemptions from the prescription requirement, which has become the Department of Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s Holy Grail.</P>
      <P>During negotiations, the only other countries who had a similar regime and worries to our own were the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. While to a lesser extent Spain and Portugal were sympathetic, the other member states pushed for a strict application of the prescription only medicine directive because it was a codification and an endorsement of their existing systems and because it is easier and cheaper to obtain a prescription in these countries than it is in Ireland. I understand from Avril Doyle MEP&rsquo;s discussions with EU colleagues that in their firm opinion, this approach is unlikely to succeed, especially in the light of objections raised in the Council and the European Parliament during the drafting of the veterinary medicines directive in 2003.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has given a vague commitment that if she fails to get a satisfactory result on the proposed exemption list, she will review the situation and will consider redrafting the regulation to allow pharmacists and licensed merchants to issue certain limited prescriptions.</P>
      <P>This tactic will give rise to serious problems. First, in the unlikely event that we do secure such exemptions, this list will be closed. New drugs developed in the future will automatically be prescription only medicine and must be prescribed by a vet, whether they warrant a prescription or not. Second, most people with any knowledge of the workings of the EU believe it is very unlikely that Europe will allow a member state to return with a watered down proposal, after it has already submitted a comprehensive and extremely restrictive law. Third, this revised proposal will be submitted very late in the day, over 12 months after each member state is meant to have its law in place.</P><Col N="1542"/>
      <P>Realistically, it will be at least November 2006 before any agreement, if there is to be one, will be in place on the exemption list. This will leave approximately four weeks for our Government to draft a new regulation, enact it in the Houses, submit it to Brussels and gain the EU&rsquo;s approval before the new rules come into effect on 1 January 2007.</P>
      <P>The most sensible and straightforward approach is the reclassification of medicines into different categories of drugs that can be prescribed by registered persons qualified and authorised to do so by the Irish authorities, including licensed merchants and pharmacists. This is the approach taken by the authorities in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has designated vets, pharmacists and licensed merchants to issue prescriptions within the confines of the EU directive.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture and Food maintains her current position, there will be cross-Border distortions of the market in veterinary medicinal products, which will have a detrimental effect on the food chain through the development of a black market. A similar legislative approach must be adopted on both sides of the Border, thus avoiding the development of a cross-Border black market, which is essential for the maintenance of the ongoing integrity of veterinary medicinal practices. The divergent approaches taken on both sides of the Border will be a serious and significant impediment to the goal of developing an all-Ireland animal health regime, which is vital for the future promotion of Irish food products.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority has expressed serious reservations regarding the implementation of the EU directive by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in this manner. It believes the regulation may be anti-competitive and lead to increased costs for farmers. It is estimated the additional cost to farmers will be in the region of &euro;80 million per annum. The Competition Authority has highlighted the Government&rsquo;s policy, as laid down in the White Paper, Regulating Better, that new regulation be introduced only on clear need. However, there is no evidence of such a need for the regulation of preventative medicines and the authority believes putting all farm animal medicines on a prescription-only basis would be a disproportionate means of addressing public health concerns. It goes on to say this new law will effectively increase the exclusive profit earning potential of vets and will lead to reduced choice and increased costs for farmers.</P>
      <P>Another key question that the Minister has ignored is where are farmers going to find vets. This is a genuine issue on the tips of farmers&rsquo; tongues across the country. We all know the growing difficulty in getting vets. We have already seen significant problems in places such as counties Mayo and Donegal where it is extremely difficult to gain access to veterinary practitioners. If there <Col N="1543"/>is no local network via the vets to distribute medicines, many parts of the country will not be able to avail of animal remedies. Is it the Minister&rsquo;s intention to pay vets to provide a service in peripheral parts of the country, as is the case with doctors? This is a critical question. Will she guarantee the availability of vets throughout the country to provide this service?</P>
      <P>Another significant barrier to competition will be the requirement that vets identify a particular brand on a prescription. In cases where an equally effective substitute exists, this potentially allows for the closure of the animal medicines market to new medicines that may not have a widely recognised brand name or where the vet is tied into an arrangement with a particular manufacturer. This directly contravenes the directive itself, which specifically and categorically states the implementing legislation cannot hinder the development of industry or the legitimate trade in medicinal products.</P>
      <P>This type of problem has existed for years in Ireland&rsquo;s medical profession and in order to address the problem, the Department of Health and Children introduced the indicative drug target saving scheme in 1993. Under the scheme, the Department incentivises GPs to refrain from naming branded products on prescriptions and instead opt for generic brands because of the massive cost implications involved for the health service. To date, in excess of &euro;90 million has been paid out nationally to participating doctors by the Department under this scheme. The Department of Agriculture and Food is now proposing a structure similar to what was in place for human medicines prior to 1993, claiming that it will not impact on cost or competition. Of course, the Department will not need to pick up the bill for increased costs in this instance as it will be borne directly by farmers across the country.</P>
      <P>The excuse for introducing such draconian rules is that it will protect public health. The Competition Authority has pointed out that the proposed regulation would not provide any significant benefits to public health. This is supported by a study carried out in Denmark where 90% of the incidents of antibiotic resistance in human cases was caused by imported non-EU meats. Obviously, whatever medicines are being used in third country meats have the potential to significantly affect human health. Therefore, if the Minister wants to eradicate antibiotic residues in food and protect public health she, along with her EU counterparts, should focus on these imports rather than try to make Irish farmers less competitive and thereby promote the consumption of further risky food from third countries. They were trying to make scapegoats of Irish farmers who have clean bills of health and where there is no issue in respect of residues. The only such issue highlighted within the European <Col N="1544"/>Union was in Denmark, where it was clearly shown to be due to imported non-EU meats.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to do something, she should start by addressing the issue of the huge anomaly in relation to substantial transformation. Sadly, she has not done so to date. She said she has discussed it with her EU colleagues but she still has not addressed it or the issue of labelling within the catering trade, which is within her competency, in order to ensure a watertight system is put in place and no allegations are made against Irish food, allegations that are completely erroneous and doctored due to the fact we have an anomaly within the food labelling regime that allows for the relabelling and reprocessing of food from third countries to be passed off as Irish food products.</P>
      <P>Two key factors in protecting the food chain are, first, ensuring high levels of animal health and welfare by encouraging farmers and animal owners to take a preventative approach where veterinary medicines are concerned. This can best be done by enabling them to procure and administer routine management drugs as easily as possible. This avoids the use of antibiotics in the first instance and, therefore, avoids residues altogether. The second key factor is observance of the withdrawal period for each veterinary medicine administered. As long as the withdrawal period is observed, the maximum residue levels established for each drug will not be present in the animal at slaughter. Observance of withdrawal periods has absolutely nothing to do with whether a medicine is prescribed. This will not be addressed by the proposed regulations. For the Minister to say she is bringing these proposals forward on the basis of public health is an inaccuracy that should be corrected when she has the opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>If we want to protect public health and the consumer, it is imperative we provide farmers, who are professional keepers of animals, with as much information as possible about preventative care, animal medicines and their withdrawal periods. However, the regulation does the exact opposite. For the first time in legislation, the farmer is not defined as a professional keeper of animals and the only information to be provided concerning how animals should be medically treated is a prescription to do so through vets. The farmer is not entitled to have even the most basic information but the Department would be very quick to prosecute farmers if they did not have their documentation and did not monitor and implement the withdrawal periods set in place for each of these medicines. The Department is asking farmers to implement rules and regulations without giving them the basic information they require.</P>
      <P>It is essential that farmers are in a position to easily inform themselves of the various options available, whether it be through reading specialist farm press, which should include responsible <Col N="1545"/>advertisements for veterinary medicinal products, or through consultation with animal health professionals who are qualified to advise them. However, under the proposed regulation, farmers will not be able to avail of such information, which will be solely confined to veterinary professionals.</P>
      <P>Advertisements for lice and other topical treatments will be banned but similar advertisements for humans are legal and appear on a daily basis. Since advertisements for animal medicines in the UK media will be legal, will a number of officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food be deployed to go into every newsagent which sells the UK <i>Farmers Weekly</i> magazine to remove the offending pages carrying advertisements? Is that the intention of the Minister? Obviously, censorship is still part of the Government psyche.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister tabled an amendment to this fair and reasonable motion. The amendment refers not only to implementing this directive but also to implementing changes which arise from a review of existing national legislation. Perhaps that is the reason the Minister has tabled these proposals and she is merely using the directive as an excuse and a vehicle to do so.</P>
      <P>These proposals will significantly increase the cost of medicines to farmers, which will have a direct impact on animal husbandry and the cost of food production. I accept that in the case of some medicines, veterinarians are the most appropriate people to write a prescription. However, this should be limited to a restricted number of medicines and should not apply across the board. I call on the Minister and her backbench colleagues, who have stated that they are opposed to this proposal, to use their feet when they walk through the lobbies and support this motion. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction next week of the EU directive and its implementation in Ireland is causing great apprehension. The Minister and Government backbenchers are aware of what is involved. Unfortunately I do not have enough time to discuss all aspects of it, but I wish to put a number of points on the record.</P>
      <P>The Government seems to think it can impose new austere proposals on the farming community but a time will come when farmers will not put up with it. Farmers want an animal welfare environment where the best possible attention is given to the health of the livestock in the context of producing the healthiest foods for consumers. Every farmer worth his or her salt supports that.</P>
      <P>These draft regulations deal with the supply, sale and administration of properly documented farm drugs to be administered by competent people trying to do a job at several levels. I will return to that. No farmer I know, including me, wants to have access to drugs that should be and are within the control of highly trained pro<Col N="1546"/>fessionals such as vets and chemists. I do not have any trouble with that. I have lived a lifetime with it and most farmers would not have an issue with it.</P>
      <P>However, it is vital that farmers produce beef, lamb and pigmeat free from drugs and hormones and that a highly efficient screening procedure is in place to protect the consumer. Reason, balance and good sense must also come into the equation, and I will explain to the Minister what I mean by &ldquo;good sense&rdquo;. I do not want a situation whereby the everyday animal husbandry products I need to keep my cattle healthy are available only on prescription from my vet. Last Saturday week, when I dosed my calves to prevent hoose, I expected to be able to get that dose from my merchant chemist or vet. Each year when I dose my cows for worms I expect to be able to purchase the ordinary run of the mill doses from the same outlets with which I have done business for years.</P>
      <P>I am lucky because should it happen that one of my suckler cows gets mastitis on a Saturday evening, I live beside my vet. However, for thousands of people it will not be possible to get a vet on a Saturday evening. I would not expect to have to allow that cow to become poisoned with resulting pain and suffering because I could not get an intramammary to help to solve the problem. I am glad the Minister has returned to hear that important point.</P>
      <P>There is no reason that outlets other than vets cannot supply such products and several others referred to by Deputy Naughten that I do not have time to discuss. The Minister should examine the enormous increase in veterinary fees experienced by farmers in the past five years. Most farmers&rsquo; bills quadrupled during that period. If the merchants, chemists and other outlets are removed from the equation, it will be a licence to print money. The Minister and the Government are softening Irish farmers for another smack in the face. Next week, she will be hiding behind the coat tails of the eurocrats in the European Union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion and the fact that the Minister has made it back from Brussels to participate. I hope she had a successful day and that she made strong statements on what the Commissioner for trade, Mr. Peter Mandelson, has stated in particular. He has taken on a role to which he has no entitlement. We should not allow the French alone to do the dirty work. I hope the Irish Government makes strong statements.</P>
      <P>This motion is extremely focused and I do not understand why the Government has not accepted it but come forward with an amendment. For the non-farming sector, issues surrounding the purchase, supply and usage of veterinary medicines may seem like a trivial matter. For the thousands of farmers throughout Ireland who keep livestock, this is an issue of major concern.</P>
      <P>Ireland is required to legislate for Directive 2004/28/EC by the end of this month. The directive began life dealing with issues surrounding the supply and sale of medicines for human use and the rules surrounding prescription and supply. It was then extended to the area of animal medicine. In reality, the system as it stands in Ireland is not bad. For the more serious medicines used on farms a vet is required to give an analysis and then a prescription. Farmers can buy many of the lesser medicines and medical treatments off the shelf with advice from someone in the co-op or the pharmacy, as long as the medicine is approved.</P>
      <P>My understanding of what has been proposed by the Government is that it is intended to implement the directive in a manner which in <Col N="1548"/>principle would require all veterinary medicines to have a prescription. We would then seek a derogation of the rules for certain commonly used medicines so farmers will not have to call out a vet to receive a prescription each time they want a drug. This approach is both flawed and dangerous. The Government assumes we will get a derogation for the list of commonly used veterinary medicines to allow their sale without prescription. We can put forward a list but the decision will be made by an expert group of people in a standing committee linked to the Commission. The Irish Government does not make that decision. We are gambling on the fact that this supposed derogation list will be successful. Each EU country has a different system for prescribing veterinary medicines. As it happens, the Irish system is stricter than that of many other European countries. Introducing a system of prescription only veterinary medicine is more difficult and restrictive for Irish farmers than in many other European countries.</P>
      <P>The UK has recognised this problem and come up with a solution that may be applicable to Ireland. A more sensible approach should be taken by Government, as the UK has done. We should reclassify medicines into different categories of drugs so that they can be prescribed by registered persons qualified and authorised to do so by the Irish authorities. This approach is accepted by the EU.</P>
      <P>To achieve the overarching goal of safeguarding animal health and welfare through giving farmers timely, cost-effective and equitable access to medicines and animal health advice, the draft regulations must be amended to shift the emphasis from an excessive reliance on securing a list of exempt products at EU level. This is what the UK has done and if we change our tactics it could result in an all-Ireland approach towards the issue. The emphasis should be to reclassify or re-categorise medicines with a corollary and appropriate training or registration for the relevant professionally qualified person, as the Government decides, whether it be a pharmacist, merchant or in some cases, a vet. This is about taking a sensible approach, because there are significant implications for farmers across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Naughten, for bringing this matter before the House and for giving Members the opportunity to vote on this issue. It is one that may not be laid exclusively at the door of Europe, as is frequently the case.</P>
      <P>This is an issue of great concern to many farmers, particularly in my constituency. I have met individual farmers as well as the farming organisations on this matter. Red tape is already strangling Irish farmers. It is the single largest issue they consistently raise and it is responsible for the <Col N="1549"/>anger and frustration many of them feel. The Minister for Agriculture and Food fails to realise the difficulties that this continuous and persistent over-regulation puts in the way of farmers. The current proposals for prescription only animal remedies are among the most recent of many examples of bureaucratic burdens.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister continues with this proposal as it stands. It is ludicrous to allow these animal remedies to be available on prescription from vets alone. As Deputy Naughten rightly asked this evening before the Minister arrived, where does she suggest the vets are going to come from? The nature of veterinary practice in Ireland has changed considerably, with many being attracted into small animal practice. As a result a greater concentration of vets will be located in towns and larger urban areas for the future, leading to a shortage in many parts of rural Ireland. This will result not only in financial hardship for the farmer, but there is real danger that it will mean unnecessary suffering for animals as well. I cannot imagine a situation where these prescriptions for all veterinary medicines will be issued without a charge. This will be yet another financial burden on the farmer.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed regulations, there is a significant onus on the vets to retain records of prescriptions for five years. This may well require more investment in data and storage technology, with further costs to be passed on.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is not the only person with key questions to answer on this issue. The Progressive Democrats constantly claims to be a party that is pro-competition. However, its deafening silence on this issue appears to tell a different story. That party is allowing a situation to develop which is the direct opposite of competition and which will affect both price and availability, despite the clearly enunciated views of the Competition Authority on this issue. A direct consequence could be the development of a black market for animal medicines as the only affordable option for some. This is not something I condone, but the Minister must look at the realities of her decision. If farmers are unable, by reason of cost or accessibility, to get the medicines needed to treat their animals, it is the health and welfare of animals that will suffer in the long run.</P>
      <P>The existing system, which is strict, has worked well. Under the cost compliance procedures for the single farm payment, farmers face extremely tough record keeping standards and their produce is subject to rigorous testing under strict food and feed controls. The Minister should accept that it is the imposition of strict financial sanctions for non-observance of a withdrawal period of a drug that will ensure the sanctity of the food chain and protect consumers, not the simple fact that it was prescribed. The Minister is effectively saying she no longer trusts Irish farm<Col N="1550"/>ers. She does not see them as the professional keepers of animals and insists that the sole provider of information must now be the vet.</P>
      <P>In the last three and half years, this Government has introduced an array of stealth taxes, which have allowed large rises in charges for essential services to the farming community, including VAT, ESB, rising motor costs and even VHI. The backdoor charges have had a major impact on farm families. Neither can one take these costs in isolation, they must be added to the additional costs coming down the tracks associated with the single farm payment, implementation of the nitrates and looming phosphates directives and prospective grain proposals. By taking the stealth charges, rising fuel, fertiliser and even water charges, one can see the massive rise in import costs. Compare this to the farmers&rsquo; profits. These have fallen by a quarter during the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister does not want to be remembered as introducing the additional costs that may well be the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back. I hope she rethinks this issue and has something more positive to offer the House and Irish farmers this evening. Hoping for a derogation and acting on that basis is a dangerous gamble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like my colleagues, I am delighted for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members&rsquo; motion. Many of my constituents are farmers who have very strong feelings on this issue. I commend my colleagues, Deputies Naughten and Crawford for tabling this motion in the House.</P>
      <P>Under this new EU directive, all veterinary medicine will become prescription only. Imagine the chaos in the country if all human medicines that can be bought off the shelf in local foodmarkets, were to become prescription only. This is happening to animal medicines. This is only a directive, not a regulation. As Deputy Naughten said, Britain, Northern Ireland and other EU states are taking a more liberal approach in allowing suitably qualified persons to issue prescriptions, including licensed merchants and pharmacies. Ireland is fast becoming a country of regulation after regulation. The Government is driving this new regulation which will destroy the livelihoods of many farmers, young and old, and in turn drive many people off the land.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When I was growing up in County Clare every village had a butcher shop and small abattoirs supplied them with their produce. Meat was sourced locally and was almost all organic. These abattoirs and butchers gave local employment but, as a result of over-regulation, they were removed from the countryside, just like the corncrake. Now we do not know where the meat we eat is sourced. Brazilian and Argentinian beef is labelled as Irish, with little regulation or disease control. We all know about the foot and mouth <Col N="1551"/>epidemic that is currently affecting Brazil. The same may be said of poultry products imported from Thailand and other countries in the Far East. I hesitate to even mention the bird &rsquo;flu scare.</P>
      <P>We have the best beef and lamb in Ireland. The regulations the Minister proposes will lead to an explosion in the costs of preventative medicine and a drop in the use of essential medicines. Irish beef is widely recognised as a high quality product. The use of antibiotics is strictly monitored. Farmers are committed to these high standards and the vast majority of them adhere to the withdrawal periods. If they do not they pay dearly, with heavy penalties. This regulation will not improve farm health. It will have a negative effect on Irish farming. The law is anti-farming and is a charter for the veterinary profession, giving it a monopoly over farm medicines.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We cannot blame the veterinary profession for creating this situation; it has lobbied as expected. However, the responsibility lies with the Minister and the Government for allowing this over-rigorous interpretation of a directive, which recognises in its wording the flexibility required for it to be adopted in different jurisdictions within the EU. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has acknowledged that &ldquo;Rip-off Ireland&rdquo; exists. I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture and Food acknowledges this. However, if her proposed regulations are implemented, they are a recipe for ripping off Irish farmers and I urge her to withdraw them. They are a licence for one sector to print money and will add to the competitive pressures on farmers, lower standards and encourage black market medicines. Vet only prescriptions are expensive and have rocketed in cost in recent times. The same will happen to routine medicines such as vaccines, worm and fluke control doses and mastitis control products. This could add up to &euro;80 million to veterinary costs.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party understands how important agriculture is for the economy. This type of red tape is nonsense and an unnecessary and costly regulation in an industry that is constantly under pressure, with little profitable reward. Ask any farmer who bought cattle this springtime if he or she made a profit. The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. He or she will lose substantial money on such an investment. Live exports trade must be kept alive and factories must give farmers a fair price for their produce.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take on board the Fine Gael motion. She should listen to the lobby groups. If she does, she will have served her brief well. Otherwise, these regulations will add to the Government&rsquo;s considerable reputation in recent weeks for turning the screw on people struggling to get by, while millions are flittered away on consultancy fees and white elephant projects.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">The motion proposed for debate this evening demonstrates in a stark manner a serious misunderstanding on the part of its proposers of the draft regulations which my Department published and circulated for consultation on 10 August last. It also fails to take account of public statements which I have already made on the draft regulations and in reply to parliamentary questions in the House in which I clearly set out the scope of these regulations.</P>
      <P>The position is that these regulations are primarily designed to transpose EU Directive 2004/28, which provides,<i> inter alia</i>, for all veterinary medicines for food producing animals to be <Col N="1553"/>made subject to prescriptions. However, the directive also includes a provision for exemption criteria to be adopted at EU level which will provide a mechanism for certain categories of medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement. The European Union has not yet adopted a decision on the exemption criteria but must do so before 1 January 2007. Pending this decision, existing national prescription and distribution arrangements can remain in place.</P>
      <P>I have made clear that I intend to avail of the exemption clause to the maximum extent possible and my Department has made a submission to the European Commission with a view to retaining off prescription in Ireland all products, other than intramammaries, containing antibiotics which currently enjoy this status. Under the draft regulations published by my Department, veterinary medicines such as wormers and certain vaccines would continue to be available off prescription for the time being and, in practice, apart from intramammaries, we would retain the essence of our existing national prescription and distribution regime. In light of this, it would be unwise at this stage to extend the range of persons who may be permitted to prescribe.</P>
      <P>I have already stated publicly on numerous occasions that I will review the regulations, in particular the provisions relating to the categories of persons who would be permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines in light of the outcome of the exemption criteria, with a view to ensuring competition in the marketplace and avoiding the imposition of unnecessary costs on farmers.</P>

	<P>It is a pig in a poke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Full consultation will be held with all stakeholders on the matter at that stage and before a final decision is made. If I had not made these public statements, I could perhaps understand the reason the motion was framed in the terms before us. However, in view of the terms in the draft regulations and the clarification I have given, the motion is entirely without substance.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the specific points raised in the motion, I will set out the background to the draft regulations which, as I previously indicated, are designed to provide for changes to national legislation and the transposition of EU Directive 2004/28 into national law this month. My overall objective in making these regulations is to put in place a workable system for the distribution of medicines within the parameters of the EU directive which also protects public and animal health, facilitates our food export trade and minimises costs for producers.</P>
      <P>Those elements of the regulations which propose changes to our national legislation stem from a comprehensive review undertaken by my Department, in consultation with stakeholders <Col N="1554"/>and other interested parties, of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996 which constitute the current control regime for the sale, supply and use of veterinary medicines in Ireland. This review took account of operational experience and a number of important and relevant developments during the period since the regulations were adopted.</P>
      <P>The perspectives on public health issues of relevance to veterinary medicines have developed significantly over the past decade and the consumer expects effective regulation in food related areas. In particular, issues such as concerns about antimicrobial resistance have come much more to the fore. In addition, operational experience of the regulations brought to light a number of areas where inflexibilities could lead to adverse animal welfare or failure to follow appropriate vaccination practices, the latter potentially leading to greater use of antibiotic treatments. In addition, a number of specific developments which have taken place since the regulations were first brought into force will have had a bearing on the review. These include improved standards of residue testing, better arrangements for animal identification and improved regulation of the veterinary profession.</P>
      <P>In light of the review, I propose to make a number of changes to the regulations, the more important of which are as follows. The legal requirement on veterinary practitioners to examine animals clinically before prescribing will be removed, thus according greater weight to professional judgment regarding diagnosis and prescription. At the same time, it is intended to retain the bona fide relationship between practitioner and client as the context within which prescriptions will be issued. A new requirement is being introduced that practitioners must in all cases issue written prescriptions and if the practitioner supplies the medicine, he or she must issue the client with an invoice for supplying the product which is distinct from the invoice for the provision of professional services. The 1996 regulations are being amended to remove the exception for intramammaries from the general rules on antibiotics and decouple intramammaries from controls under poisons legislation. Prescribed veterinary medicines may, with certain exceptions, be supplied by licensed merchant outlets with appropriately trained personnel and by pharmacies and veterinarians. Such exceptions would, for example, apply to injectable antibiotics and sedatives. The &ldquo;Prescription Only Exempt&rdquo; category from the sales categories provided for in the legislation will be removed. The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, will be designated as the competent authority for veterinary vaccines in addition to its existing role for other medicines. These amendments will result in a regime which is more coherent, effective and workable and operates in the interests of both consumers and producers while <Col N="1555"/>continuing to respect the legitimate interests of other stakeholders.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment specifically on the issue of intramammaries. For many years, Ireland has been virtually on its own in the European Union in having this category of antibiotic medicine available off prescription. The House is no doubt aware of the growing concerns about the growth of antibiotic resistance, particularly over the past ten years. This has led to many influential bodies at EU and international levels, including the World Health Organisation, recommending that all antibiotic medicines should be subject to prescription control. The Irish Medicines Board has also recommended that prescription controls be applied to intramammaries.</P>
      <P>In approaching this issue, I fully recognise that the milk industry in general was quite successful in regulating the use of intramammaries under the existing mechanisms. Nonetheless, the IMB, having examined the position, noted in its report that: &ldquo;allowing the existing situation to continue is not satisfactory and does not conform with current international scientific opinion on the prudent use of antibiotics&rdquo;. Accordingly, I concur with the view reached by my predecessor that there is no option but to introduce an alternative system. In doing so, however, we should retain what is best in the existing system. Thus, with appropriate veterinary intervention the milk industry, with its ready access to relevant data, can continue to be fully involved in this area and farmers will be able to get reasonable access to necessary treatments. It is also worth mentioning the crucial role that veterinary treatments play in modern food production. Such treatments are also important for protecting the health and welfare of the increasing number of animals kept as companion animals and pets. In terms of food production, the innovations in veterinary treatments have provided the basis for modern animal production systems, leading to the safe and secure food source we now take for granted in this part of the world. Antibacterial treatments are a case in point because without them we simply would not be able to manage current production systems that would produce safe food at an economic price.</P>
      <P>As a country which is so dependent on export markets, we must ensure that we maintain our reputation for safe, wholesome and quality food. This is, in essence, another dimension of our competitiveness. To maintain our reputation, I must ensure that any decisions I make at this time will not in any way undermine our hard won reputation on foreign markets. I need only remind the House of the capital which was made by competitors of problems encountered with hormones and antibiotics some years ago to demonstrate just how fragile this reputation can be and of the need to ensure that our control regimes enjoy the con<Col N="1556"/>fidence of both regulators and buyers in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on the background to the legislation which we are obliged to transpose into national law by the end of this month. The review which led to the new EU regulation was comprehensive and embraced both the human and veterinary sectors. The main objectives of the review were to improve the protection of human health as well as animal health and welfare and also to improve the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical industry, particularly with a view to increasing the availability of veterinary medicines in all member states.</P>
      <P>The only element of the directive which has received any publicity in Ireland is the requirement that any veterinary medicines must come under prescription control. However, the directive also includes a range of measures which will have a positive effect in securing an innovative pharmaceutical industry in the EU and also the continued availability of an adequate range of treatments. Some of the measures, especially those relating to the mutual recognition and cascade regimes, will bring particular benefits to small peripheral markets such as Ireland&rsquo;s.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the specific issues referred to in the motion, many of which are overlapping and exaggerated out of all proportion. As I said earlier, they are all based on the false premise that the draft regulation will significantly extend the range of veterinary medicines which must be prescribed by a veterinary practitioner.</P>
      <P>There is no substance to the suggestions that the draft regulation will impose unimplementable and unworkable restrictions on farmers, that they are overly bureaucratic or that they would seriously restrict the availability of animal medicines. The opposite is the case. The draft regulation includes a number of important changes to the existing rules which are designed to make the arrangements more farmer friendly. Apart from those mentioned earlier, I also propose to extend the life of a prescription from its current period of validity of 31 days to six months. Taken together, these proposals are specifically designed to simplify the procedures surrounding the prescribing of veterinary medicines and to reduce the cost of the prescription requirements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the additional cost which it has been suggested the draft regulations will impose on farmers, I would be interested to know how the framers of the motion arrived at a figure of &euro;80 million. As is the case with the motion generally, this figure is completely unfounded, particularly in the context of the overall value of the veterinary medicines sector, which has been estimated by APHA at &euro;96 million in 2004. The only additional cost which the draft regulations might possibly impose on farmers arises from the reclassification of intramammaries. I already outlined <Col N="1557"/>the changes I am introducing in the prescription regime in order to limit the impact of this decision, which will be minimal. In particular, the removal of the requirement on a veterinary practitioner to inspect an animal prior to prescribing a medicine is specifically designed to enable prescriptions for intramammaries to be written without a prior examination. My Department is also looking at various suggestions for a more flexible approach to prescribing intramammaries, particularly in the context of mastitis control programmes, which I fully accept have made a major contribution to the reduction of antibiotic residues in milk.</P>
      <P>I am also proposing other changes in the draft regulations to increase competition in the supply of veterinary medicines with the ultimate objective of reducing costs. For example, I am requiring veterinary practitioners to write prescriptions and to provide a separate invoice to the farmer. These changes will serve the dual purpose of introducing transparency into the system and at the same time permit farmers to shop around for best value in veterinary medicines. Furthermore, I am proposing to permit, for the first time, licensed merchants to supply certain prescription medicines to encourage increased competition with veterinary practitioners and pharmacies.</P>
      <P>The Competition Authority expressed certain reservations about the draft regulations. However, the authority was operating under the same misapprehensions as to the nature of the draft regulations as the framers of the motion before the House. My Department has written to the Competition Authority to remove those misapprehensions. However, I assure the House that I attach considerable importance to ensuring that the regulatory regime encourages competition in the market for veterinary medicines while at the same time providing the necessary protections for animal health and welfare and human health and I will take the views of the authority into account in the review of my regulations next year.</P>
      <P>In view of the limited scope of the draft regulations in terms of the additional veterinary medicines which will be brought under prescription control, there is no basis for the suggestion that the draft regulations will discriminate against the competitiveness of Irish agriculture. In most member states in the EU, apart from the UK, the writing of prescriptions is generally confined to veterinarians and the information available to my Department is that they do not intend to depart from this practice. Intramammaries have been subject to prescriptions for some time in the United Kingdom and the draft regulation will merely bring us into line with practice there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not making a strong case for the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1558"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggestion that the draft regulations will facilitate the creation of a monopoly in the sale of veterinary medicines is equally groundless. Intramammaries are the only current products which will become prescription medicines as a result of the draft regulations. I am also introducing other countervailing changes in the existing regulations to encourage a more transparent and competitive market in veterinary medicines.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the draft regulation which will hinder good farming practice or have a negative effect on animal welfare. Pending the adoption of the exemption criteria at EU level, farmers will continue to be able to access veterinary medicines, with the exception of intramammaries, on the same basis as at present.</P>
      <P>On the availability of veterinary practitioners in certain parts of the country, veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their location is driven by commercial realities. In so far as Government involvement is concerned, I draw attention to measures in the new Veterinary Practice Act which should help to address any shortages in Irish trained veterinary practitioners. For the first time, the Veterinary Council is being enabled to recognise qualifications from applicants in third countries generally. This, taken with the recent enlargement of the EU, should make for the improved availability of practitioners from outside the State to meet any shortfalls in the supply side. In addition, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is providing funding to subsidise veterinary practices in remote areas.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the impact of the draft regulations on the possible development of a cross-Border black market in veterinary medicines. It has been suggested, for that reason, that we should adopt the same approach as the United Kingdom to the implementation of the directive. I remind those who make this suggestion that in the United Kingdom prescriptions for intramammaries may be written only by veterinarians and may only be supplied by veterinarians and pharmacies. Is that the view being proposed? The system which I am proposing for intramammaries is more flexible, particularly in that licensed merchants will continue to be permitted to supply these medicines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that qualified professionals, other than veterinary practitioners, should be permitted to write prescriptions, I will consider that suggestion next year in light of the EU decision on the criteria for exempting certain products from the prescription requirement. The simple fact of the matter is that there is no need to take a decision to extend the range of prescribers until we know what additional medicines will become subject to prescriptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Minister passing the regulation at the end of the month?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1559"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy does not like to hear the truth. At one extreme, if my Department is successful in securing criteria which permit us to retain most of the existing range of medicines off­prescription, it may not be necessary to extend the range of prescribers. On the other hand, if a substantial number of products which are currently off-prescription become prescription medicines, I will have to take that situation into consideration in my decision on the issue.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely foolish to provide at this stage for prescriptions to be written by non-veterinary practitioners because to do so would necessarily also oblige me to designate as prescription only some of the medicines which are now off­prescription. It is simply not practical to provide for prescriptions for certain products to be written by non-veterinary practitioners without at the same time identifying those products which they would be permitted to prescribe. As I said earlier, my Department is seeking to secure exemption status for all existing off-prescription medicines, with the exception of intramammaries. It would undermine our negotiating position if I were to re-categorise unilaterally at this stage some off-prescription medicines as requiring prescriptions. My Department&rsquo;s approach of deferring a decision on whether it will be necessary to extend the range of prescribers until the exemption criteria issue is resolved is the best approach to take in these circumstances.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>As far as the exemption criteria are concerned, the European Commission has indicated that it intends to submit its proposals to the standing veterinary committee early next year. We will press the Commission to honour this commitment because we recognise the need for an early resolution of this matter to enable us to take our decisions on the prescribing issue well in advance of 1 January 2007. My Department intends to engage actively with the various stakeholders prior to any decision being made.</P>
      <P>With regard to compliance, Directive 2004/28 specifies the requirements with which farmers are required to comply in terms of record keeping. Specifically, records are required of purchases and use of medicines. The draft regulations simply give effect to these requirements. The new requirements on vets to issue written prescriptions in all cases will facilitate the farmer in keeping this record and the keeping of a computerised record, which is something that has been sought by farming organisations.</P>
      <P>On the issue of advertising, the ban on advertising of prescription products to the public was inserted at the behest of the European Parliament. Therefore, let Deputies take their censorship and talk to the man who has just left the House. I share the views of the farming organisations and others that this is not a particularly sensible provision and that it is unwise to seek to <Col N="1560"/>reduce access by farmers to information on veterinary medicines, in particular new products. The Commission has already indicated in writing to my Department it considers that farmers fall within the term &ldquo;general public&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, we have gone back to the Commission pointing out the consequences which could flow from a ban. I have asked the Commissioner to consider a more flexible interpretation.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that my Department has sought and received written submissions from most of the main stakeholders. It also subsequently met many of them as part of the consultation process. In addition, as required by the legislation, the animal remedies consultative committee met yesterday to consider the draft regulations. Clearly, a number of issues have been raised with regard to the draft regulations. I will take final decisions on these issues in light of the recommendations of the consultative committee as well as other stakeholders.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views that have been expressed about the possible impact of the regulation on competition in the supply of veterinary medicines arising in particular from the requirement in the EU directive that all veterinary medicines for food producing animals must be subject to prescription. However, I have clarified first that in so far as the issue of prescribing veterinary medicines is concerned, the only change arising from the draft regulations is that intramammaries will be subject to prescription at this stage. I will review the draft regulations next year in light of the decision at EU level on the criteria for exempting veterinary medicines from the prescription requirement, specifically with a view to taking decisions on whether it will be necessary to extend the range of persons permitted to prescribe veterinary medicines. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this amendment. Ireland has always been a country with a strong agricultural base and this remains the case with our 135,000 farm families. While many aspects of agriculture have changed and evolved, it is still an integral part of the dynamic economy. Agriculture and the agri-sector include every region of the country and are of major national, economic and social importance.</P><Col N="1561"/>
      <P>The Irish beef industry is worth &euro;1.4 billion in foreign earnings to the economy annually. Ireland produced 560,000 tonnes of beef in 2004, exporting 495,000 tonnes and with a domestic consumption of 86,000 tonnes. With such an excess of production over consumption, Ireland is the number one exporter of beef into Europe. Irish companies are major suppliers throughout Europe and have gained a top class portfolio of retail accounts there. To put this in context, Ireland&rsquo;s agrifood sector accounted for 9% of gross domestic product in 2004. Jobs in the sector accounted for 9% of total employment. Exports of agrifood products accounted for 8.4% of total exports in 2004, with an estimated value of more than &euro;7 billion.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. It is encouraging to note that our beef exports to the premium continental EU markets more than doubled in recent years from 72,000 tonnes in 2001 to 174,000 tonnes last year. In 2004, we exported 264,000 tonnes to the United Kingdom. This contrasts with the situation that prevailed during the 1990s when the industry exported 50% of its products to non-EU markets. It is important we protect this market.</P>
      <P>The Irish beef industry must continue to build further sustainable market share in continental Europe. I would expect to see us expanding our reach to at least 230,000 tonnes within the next two years. This is a major marketing challenge, but it must be tackled to secure the future of the Irish beef industry. It is a task made all the more urgent by the inevitable increase in beef supply in Britain in the immediate aftermath of the cessation of the over 30 months scheme, scheduled for the end of this year, as Ireland is currently the dominant import supplier to the UK retail sector. For the future therefore, we must continue to enhance the position and image of Irish beef in the European marketplace.</P>
      <P>In this connection, Bord Bia recently launched its Irish Beef in Europe autumn campaign. This pan-European campaign which runs from now until the end of November will see on-pack promotions in 8,000 stores across nine countries, stores frequented by some 40 million shoppers every week. The promotion has been tailored appropriately for maximum impact in each country. Bord Bia is investing &euro;10 million over three years in its European retail marketing initiative aimed at building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets and to establish the Irish brand firmly in the minds of consumers there.</P>
      <P>Consumer requirements must be top of the agenda for the beef industry, as well as for the agrifood sector in general. Consumers are entitled to full assurance about the food they eat. <Col N="1562"/>They also want information on the origin of the meat they consume. In respect of beef, we already have in place a full identification, traceability and labelling system under comprehensive EU regulations. The labelling requirements under those regulations extend up to and including retail level and to the point of delivery into hotels, restaurants and catering establishments.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s priority in this area is to extend the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the country of origin of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. Specific proposals were put to Government at the end of June for a legislative framework to facilitate this by way of an amendment to the Health Act 1947. This will be introduced under the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 which will come before the Oireachtas this session. The appropriate regulations are being worked on and it is intended to have these cleared at EU level as soon as possible. When the Act is amended and the regulations made, country of origin information will be available to consumers in respect of all beef served in restaurants, hotels and the catering sector in Ireland on a mandatory basis.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the various representative bodies in the sector, following discussions with the Department, have agreed in advance of the mandatory legal requirement to commend to their members the introduction on a voluntary basis of a mechanism for giving consumers on their premises information on the country of origin of beef. I support the Minister&rsquo;s endeavours in this regard. My comments indicate clearly the need to keep Ireland&rsquo;s exports clean and green, which is the industry&rsquo;s strongest selling point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The single most important aspect of the prescribing of animal remedies is the need to assure consumers that the food derived from animals which have received such remedies is safe and of good quality. Consumer confidence, which is a top priority, must not be compromised. It is <Col N="1563"/>equally important that the welfare requirements and health status of animals being treated must not be marginalised. As some of my colleagues have said, the consequences of a long delay in providing appropriate treatment for an animal need to be taken into consideration. Our export market must be protected.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the problems encountered by Ireland when hormones and antibiotics were misused in days gone by. It is fair to say that hormones were never intended to be on prescription anyway. The question of their being prescribed or otherwise by certain people did not arise. It was cowboy territory and highly illegal. It was not a question of who had the right to say whether the hormones should have been prescribed. Many cases found their way into the courts. It was cowboy territory and did not have anything to do with prescriptions.</P>
      <P>We need to balance the differing needs of the various stakeholders. Consumers, who are entitled to safe food, are the most significant stakeholders in the long run. The rights of the farming community, which can have great difficulty in accessing appropriate medicines for animals within a reasonable timeframe and at an acceptable cost, should not be compromised. Many of the Minister&rsquo;s remarks seem to be reassuring on the surface. I am sure we will pick some holes in her response later in the debate.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the most significant change proposed in the draft regulations is the requirement that all veterinary medicines, not just anti-inflammatory medicines and antibiotics, will be upgraded to prescription-only status. It is likely that vets will have a monopoly on prescriptions, so it seems probable that they will have a monopoly on the provision of veterinary products. I am glad that the Minister has raised her concerns with the Competition Authority. It seems that the information which was initially provided appears to suggest that the change was anti-competitive and that a monopoly situation was likely to evolve from it.</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked about the possibility of other interests invading the market. The Minister spoke about the possible development of a black market, which is a likely outcome. It is a difficult aspect of the problem. A black market will develop, not for the first time or the last time, if proper means of enforcement are not put in place. Certain conditions must be put in place to ensure that no such scenario evolves.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that people other than vets be allowed to prescribe animal remedies. It could be argued that those who work closely with animals are in a position to determine the need for a particular animal remedy. Equally, it could be argued that the vet treating the animal under his or her care is the only person entitled to make a recommendation. I do not think that is necess<Col N="1564"/>arily the case, however. The concept of herd health is an important one. One of the flaws in these proposals is that vets will have the right to issue prescriptions on the basis of the examinations of herds which they will make once a year. Although many things can happen over 12 months, I understand that under the proposed regulation vets will not be required to examine herds more often than that. This aspect needs to be considered.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies have raised serious concerns about the availability of vets. I agree that we need to consider the number of veterinary practitioners and surgeons available. Members who represent rural constituencies and places like my native territory of west Clare will be familiar with the difficulties encountered by people in such places when they try to access vets at certain times.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta offers a subsidy &mdash; I heard an interesting spat about that precise matter on the radio last week &mdash; but she did not quite answer the question. Subsidies are being considered but they do not represent a solution. There are large gaps in the availability of veterinary services in some parts of the country. I understand that the dearth of vets may be caused by lifestyle considerations. It may be much more attractive for vets to get involved in small animal practice. As that attitude will not change, the matter will have to be addressed in an alternative manner.</P>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister mentioned pharmacists who have a background that allows them to make judgments in many cases on the suitability of particular medicines. I hope we continue to allow them to make such judgments, particularly in consultation with farmers. We need to be given a definition of the phrase &ldquo;suitably qualified persons&rdquo;. As a general principle, such persons should be allowed to write prescriptions, bearing human health and animal welfare considerations in mind. Farmers are entitled to a choice of supplier and to healthy competition in the marketplace, which is most important. The definition of &ldquo;suitability qualified persons&rdquo; is the key question in this context.</P>
      <P>Changes have been made in the training of veterinary surgeons and other associated professions. Those who study agricultural science at UCD, for example, take courses which are also taught to those studying veterinary science. It should be possible to accommodate such changes and to ensure that courses appropriate to each category of student take account of the need for professional skills in dealing with animal health. The level of training offered to students should be designed to ensure that they are suitably qualified to advise on the need for a particular treatment. This proposal has been made by a number of interest groups which have addressed the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. Common <Col N="1565"/>courses are taught to students of animal science, food science and veterinary science. We should bear in mind that those who practice such professions share a common understanding of animal welfare needs, etc.</P>
      <P>I understand that the proposed list system, to which the Minister referred, depends on total agreement at EU level. It is not a matter for just one EU member state. We need to address the real risk that the list which is currently accepted will become smaller and that a number of the animal remedies which are available without prescription will be removed from the list. There are good commercial reasons for ensuring that pharmacists can write prescriptions. I have mentioned the lack of veterinary expertise in some parts of the country. One is much less likely to encounter such a lack of expertise among pharmacists. There are good commercial reasons pharmacists can remain in practice when veterinary practitioners are unable to do so or might not want to remain in a particular part of the country where it can be difficult to deliver the practice.</P>
      <P>Food safety, consumer protection, animal welfare and economic implications need to be borne in mind when decisions are being taken on the proposed regulations. As Deputy Naughten said, there is a chance that new drugs coming on the market will be excluded. It is important that we take action in that regard. This country stands firmly behind its clean and green image. None of us wants to do anything that compromises that image in any way. We need to ensure fair play for the farming community, veterinary practitioners and other qualified people without engaging in any form of compromise that would be detrimental to us.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, are fans of &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo;. It is worth noting the course of action taken by Marge Simpson in the episode in which she discovered that the Simpsons&rsquo; dog had fleas. Rather than putting a flea collar on the dog, Santa&rsquo;s Little Helper, she put it on her children. Although it was a novel way of dealing with an animal health problem, I would not endorse such a prescription from a veterinary point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, said this motion was fatuous and not required. Nevertheless, it was worthwhile to gain clarification from the Minister on a number of issues. I did so because I know the Department of Agriculture and Food officials. I dealt specifically with the Diseases of Animals Act 2001 and spent hours in the House on it. I was given commitments through the Minister by the officials that they would consolidate and codify the 1966 Act <Col N="1566"/>with the 2001 Act. That was almost five years ago but nothing has happened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised to hear that because a lot of work has moved from that Department, given the new system of payments.</P>
      <P>What worries me is that one often sees the stamp of bureaucrats in the implementation of regulations. It is important we, as politicians, ensure that what emerges is practical. It is fine to propose theories but some of the measures implemented in the 2001 Act should be scrapped because they have served their purpose and it is time to get rid of them. Otherwise, as with the emergency legislation of 1939, it will be reviewed on an ongoing basis and never come to an end. It is time we faced up to the reality that some of the measures in place are no longer required. There is no longer an emergency. I debated this legislation <i>ad nauseam</i> and put forward amendments to remove its most draconian aspects. It has achieved its objective and I would like to see areas of it revisited. Perhaps some will not like my saying this but I must do so on behalf of the people who elect me.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated in 2002 during the period in office of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. I made the point that sometimes we are almost too good as Europeans. We rush to the headland to make sure we implement the exact wording of regulations and transpose them verbatim without taking cognisance of particular circumstances. We could learn from the French in this regard. They are good at making sure that all regulations and directives are amended to suit them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton was the first to call for proper labelling of goods, including not only the country of origin but the place of origin, whether it be Wexford, Waterford or the townland of Kilmeaden. She wanted every ingredient to be on the label. I went to the Rungis market in Paris one morning at 4.30 a.m. I saw lamb and beef from the finest place in the country &mdash; Kilbeggan &mdash; where we know how to produce beef and lamb. The French had little blue and white flags on their meat so their consumers would know what lamb and beef was French. We are such good Europeans we are almost terrified of identifying exactly what is good in this country. We should brand our products to show off our good, green image.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to intramammaries. That was an aspect of the bad old days when we were qualifying in agriculture and when perhaps excess was used. However, there are now somatic cell <Col N="1567"/>counts and other processes in creameries and elsewhere throughout the country. If somebody slips up, he or she loses a whole container of milk, not just on one day but for the following two days also. One would want to be the greatest fool to let a 400 gallon tank of milk go down the drain three days in a row. Farmers are as good as guardians of their products as any qualified person &mdash; I speak as a qualified agriculturist. They are as good as anybody else. If they were not, they would be lost and their demise would be accelerated if they did not deal with this issue in a safe way.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister reassured me with some of the points she made. In the early 1970s I qualified at UCD. Some of those I qualified with now practise medicine and dispensation. They have 30 years' experience and are as good as anyone else in this regard. They should be trusted. I know my local vet, who has enough to do.</P>
      <P>It is time the points system for entry to veterinary studies was done away with. It is nonsense that one would need 600 points to become a vet. Some people in rural Ireland would make excellent vets and whether they get an A in honours mathematics has nothing to do with it. One would be better to have a good scientific background. It is time we examined the curriculum to ensure an adequate supply of vets throughout the country. The system for access to a veterinary degree is too restrictive and excludes those who have spent their lives on farms and know animals, which is what it is all about.</P>
      <P>Farmers are the greatest custodians of our produce. They would be fools if they did anything to harm their own products or created a difficulty for the country. That risk is in the past. However, I am concerned that we might place farmers in an unworkable situation. I wrote to the Minister with examples of this. The situation was so tight I was afraid the Minister would return to the bad old days of an unregulated black market.</P>

Yet, the bureaucrats and technocrats in Europe think the like of him are not fit to look after animals. It is time to cry &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1568"/>
      <P>Some might say I am eurosceptic &mdash; I am when I hear of some of the suggestions from the great brain boxes of Europe who try to put impediments in the way of growth. There is jealousy involved. We are a country rich in natural product &mdash; grass, animals and otherwise &mdash; and they want to put impediments in our way. If a prescription is issued for a specific branded product rather than an active ingredient, farmers might not have the opportunity to purchase from an outlet. They need to have outlets of their choice.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not sign off on any regulations before coming back to fools like ourselves. We might know better than the technocrats. I have had enough of this racket. In 2001 I received an assurance in the House and when I receive such an assurance, I take it as the equivalent of an affidavit from the Minister. I am very annoyed. I told farmers the position as I understood it but the commitments were not lived up to. I might be fooled once but not twice.</P>
      <P>What is the position if a vet is not available to issue a prescription for a medicine? I saw a report on television on the situation in Bangor Erris. What happens when a cow has mastitis, grass tetany or other diseases? Is the farmer supposed to wait until the cow puts her four legs up in the air? Let us get real. What is the advice on these diseases? These are practical issues. Some might think that, as a member of the Labour Party, I know nothing about farming; I know a lot more than many. That is why the people of Westmeath have faithfully returned me and will again.</P>

There is too much paternalism in this country and in Europe. It is time to give farmers an opportunity. There is already this racket whereby people cannot produce free range eggs which are the finest eggs in the country. Will we say to farmers they cannot produce a drop of milk because they do not have a prescription for this particular intramammary? It is time we cried stop to the madness and bureaucracy coming from Europe.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>This afternoon I raised with the Minister for Health and Children a letter the consultants in Cavan and Monaghan sent to management flagging the difficulties imminent within the service. I was shocked today when the Minister told me a bed was available for Pat Joe Walsh in Cavan but that it was not made known to staff at Monaghan General Hospital. What makes this more difficult is the fact this issue was flagged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like to explain the manner in which it was flagged. The letter sent by the consultants stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">We, the undersigned consultant surgeons met at a joint Department of Surgery of Cavan and Monaghan Hospitals on Thursday 8th September &rsquo;05 in Cavan General Hospital and unanimously decided that Monaghan General Hospital should go back on call for acute surgical emergencies. This is following an unprecedented number ... of patients waiting for treatment on trolleys in Cavan A&amp;E Department and we would be grateful if you could arrange for adequate resources including hiring of theatre nurses in Monaghan General Hospital for evening and night duties and meetings with the regional ambulance control to ensure there is no delay about Monaghan going back on call for acute surgical services.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That letter clearly states that there is a major problem. All the consultants in Cavan and Monaghan have outlined that the system they are expected to operate is unsafe, not workable and is costing lives. Worse than that, it will cost lives in the future and it is not a matter of if but when these lives will be lost. To date, 16 people have lost their lives in Monaghan General Hospital as a result in the change in services. This requires an urgent remedy.</P>
        <P>It brings health care to a whole new dimension to think surgeons must flag a difficulty. The configuration of services devised by the steering group of chief executive officers was brought in to ensure safe services. These consultants who are asked to deliver the service are the experts and they have told us it is not safe and what they are expected to do is not good. However, we still read about patients on trolleys in Cavan General Hospital. They simply cannot cope with the level of demand for services in Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals.</P>
        <P>The letter sent by the consultants was dated 15 September, yet no action was taken on foot of it. This is unacceptable. If something had been done, a death such as Pat Joe Walsh&rsquo;s could have been avoided. I call on the Health Service Executive to take action.</P><Col N="1570"/>
        <P>There is a new six-day accident and emergency unit at Monaghan General Hospital but resources have not been provided to open it fully and to make it operational. It is state-of-the-art with facilities to deal with infectious disease and so on in that it has positive-negative air ventilation systems. We hear there is no lack of resources but management will say it has not been allocated additional resources to open and increase the six-day accident and emergency unit at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>
        <P>The consultants hit the core of the issue as well and have called for adequate resources, including the hiring of theatre nurses. It beggars belief that this issue has been ignored. Today I felt the Minister hid behind the fact the steering group report stated that this is the level of service we should have. In September 2001 the then chief executive issued what he called a configuration of health services. He made numerous attempts to get people to agree to and endorse what he considered an adequate service for the hospital. The consultants in Cavan and Monaghan have tried this system for a period but it is not working and is unsafe. Safety was allegedly what drove this. Responsibility lies with the Department. When something is not working, the Minister must take a hands-on approach and demand answers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot say I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue because it is one of tragic proportions. I sympathise with the Walsh family on their great loss. I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to visit Monaghan General Hospital. It is a simple request so that she can see for herself the excellent staff, the brand new theatre and the potential to save lives which could have been used in this case.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste has visited other hospitals and I am aware that when she sat opposite a few days ago, she said she had got private individuals to go to one of the hospitals near this town to talk about building a private health sector. Here we have a brand new theatre, capable staff and facilities which could be utilised in the public sector but which are underutilised.</P>
        <P>I listened with interest and some trepidation to the Taoiseach. He said the most important issue was patient safety and that it must come first. Is insurance the main issue? Since Monaghan General Hospital went off call in 2002, there have been 16 deaths. That does not say too much about safety, yet the Taoiseach insisted that he and the Minister for Health and Children must go by the experts.</P>
        <P>Why was Mr. Patrick Walsh transferred, in the first instance, from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to Monaghan General Hospital? Is it correct that three intensive care beds were vacant on that Thursday in Drogheda? If the protocol introduced by the former health board CEO and the <Col N="1571"/>so-called expert group was as good as the Taoiseach said today, why was there not a back-up service in Cavan or why did Drogheda not accept the patient back? Does the T&aacute;naiste have any confidence in the management of the health service in respect of the hospitals in the north east and, if not, what will she do about it?</P>
        <P>Today I was asked where the T&aacute;naiste was hiding and why she could not visit the hospitals in this area, especially Monaghan General Hospital. Has she met the hospital alliance group or the hospital consultants who, as Deputy Connolly said, have demanded that Monaghan General Hospital be put back on call for emergency surgery? Are the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach suggesting that the consultants in Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals know less about the needs of the area and the services they must provide than non-medical executives?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that he cannot understand what is going on in this part of the country. However, it is no secret that he did not visit Monaghan General Hospital when he visited County Monaghan on Friday last. That would have been an opportunity for him to clarify the issue for himself. He did not meet the elected councillors who requested a meeting to deal with the hospital issue. While I welcome the inquiry into the death of Mr. Patrick Walsh, more committees or expert groups are not needed for Monaghan General Hospital. As the hospital alliance committee advised the Taoiseach, if the surgical nurses were put back on staff for night purposes, everything else would be in place.</P>
        <P>I welcome the efforts of the steering committee to bring Monaghan General Hospital back on-call for medicine, as many lives have been saved since last January. However, it is unfair to say, as the Taoiseach did today, that the steering committee was happy or satisfied with the surgery situation in the hospital. The laws were laid down by the chief executive officer and it had no choice but to sign on the agreement. All surgery consultants in the Cavan General Hospital are demanding an emergency surgeon be put back. All consultants in Monaghan General Hospital say the same. I urge the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health and Children to listen to the experts on the ground. She must do as she has done on the IT issue and take control of services at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies Connolly and Crawford for raising this matter. I offer my sincere sympathies, and those of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh, rest in peace, who died tragically at Monaghan General Hospital last Friday.</P><Col N="1572"/>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has commissioned Mr. Patrick Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast, to carry out an independent and external review of these circumstances. This review will be completed and a report issued within a timeframe of eight weeks or less. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children expects the review to answer all questions around this tragic case as a matter of urgent public interest.</P>
        <P>It is disturbing to learn, even in advance of the review, that a fully staffed intensive care bed was available at Cavan General Hospital. It has also emerged that a high dependency bed was available at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The position of Beaumont Hospital is being clarified by the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>On the specific questions raised by the Deputies about surgical services at Monaghan General Hospital, the Health Service Executive has advised the Department that the policy approach in respect of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group was set out in the 2004 report of a steering group established by the former North Eastern Health Board. The group was representative of all key stakeholders and included consultant representation from both hospital sites in the disciplines of surgery, medicine and radiology. The Department is further advised that the members of the group unanimously approved the recommendations of the steering group. The executive board of the former North Eastern Health Board accepted the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations in late 2004.</P>
        <P>The steering group recommended major and emergency surgery should be carried out in Cavan General Hospital and that Monaghan General Hospital should provide selective elective surgery. The report&rsquo;s recommendations took account of advice received from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. In accordance with the recommendations of the steering group, a full surgical team based in Cavan will provide services at Monaghan General Hospital in the form of selective elective surgery on a Monday to Friday basis. The Health Service Executive has also recently appointed a non-practising lead consultant surgeon at the Cavan-Monaghan department of surgery whose remit is to oversee an implementation plan arising from the college of surgeons&rsquo; advice on the future configuration of surgical services in Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the steering group&rsquo;s recommendations, Monaghan Hospital returned to 24-hour, seven-day medical cover in January 2005. A third consultant physician has been in post since November 2004 and five new anaesthetic non-consultant hospital doctors have been recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to medical on-call status.</P><Col N="1573"/>
        <P>The arrangements outlined are being put in place by the Health Service Executive. They are designed to enhance the overall level of surgical services across the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group. The T&aacute;naiste will give her consideration to Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s invitation to visit Monaghan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The case for the western rail corridor has been well made. All the signs of a poorly designed transport system are visible to hard-pressed motorists trying to negotiate their way into and out of their workplaces in every city and provincial town every day of the week, every week of the year. The sharp increase in car ownership is destined to continue and, irrespective of what happens in the road building programme, nobody expects roads alone to solve traffic problems.</P>
        <P>To achieve viable regional and spatial development, few projects could bring as much economic, social, cultural and environmental benefit to the area stretching from Cork to Limerick to Sligo as the western rail corridor. The western rail corridor committee has applied the litmus test under several headings to the project and on all fronts it passes the evaluation with flying colours.</P>
        <P>Most members of the public do not realise the daily traffic flow at Kinnegad, County Westmeath, where the Sligo traffic joins up on the Galway route to Dublin, amounts to 21,599 average daily journeys. However, 120 miles west at Claregalway, near Galway city, this figure jumps to an astonishing 30,000 journeys under the same measurement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The potential service area for the western rail corridor includes the Sligo gateway, Knock International Airport, the Knock Shrine, large-scale industrial development, including that at Oranmore and Athenry with up to 5,000 new skilled <Col N="1574"/>jobs planned, the Galway gateway, including Galway Airport, linked to Shannon Airport and the Limerick gateway. We do not even know what the area will get out of decentralisation, if anything.</P>
        <P>Can one imagine the importance of a rail link running down as the backbone of the entire BMW area when planning new housing estates? For the west, it would be similar to a Luas type train service, with the same effect on the lives of the people of the west as the Luas now has on the lives of many people in Dublin.</P>
        <P>International consultants, Faber Maunsell, commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, estimated that the cost of opening the line would be &euro;366 million, which compares favourably with the strategic rail review figure of &euro;310 million using 2002 prices. In the language of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, where &euro;150 million is small beer, this amounts to two beers. For the price of two beers, we could have a new railway line.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An appraisal of the benefits of the corridor was conducted by a sub-group under the direction of the Rail Procurement Agency. It addressed sustainable regional development, accessibility and social inclusion, interregional economy, environment and quality of life, implementation, efficiency, stakeholder and public support and freight and commercial operation. Out of 36 parameters, 33 were found to be either beneficial or strongly beneficial. The investigation showed it was beneficial on 16 counts, strongly beneficial on 15 counts, neutral in one instance and negative on only two counts. One negative was in regard to the need for multiple handling of certain consignments of rail freight and the other concerned the possibility of some objections to the redevelopment from adjacent landlords.</P>
        <P>Another group looked at the demand for rail travel. Research was carried out on the take-up if an efficient train service at an affordable price was introduced. It suggested the bus and road traffic volumes on the Sligo-Claremorris road, 2.5 million passenger journeys per annum, with 3.5 million extra between Claremorris and Lough George and a further 6 million between Lough George and Galway, represent a pool of 12 million current passenger journeys from which to draw rail passengers. It is estimated the railway enjoys approximately 10% market share of the traffic on the Athlone bypass annually. It is reasonable to believe this type of market share could be taken off the road and onto the trains under similar circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Government has given an undertaking on several occasions that it would approve the western rail corridor. Several Ministers and several commissions later, there is still no approval. The least the Government can do, given it has decided to put a new railway line from Dublin to Kildare, <Col N="1575"/>announced last week, is to approve the restoration of the western rail corridor forthwith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The western rail corridor is the name given to a proposed rail link that would connect Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork. The corridor was one of more than 150 proposals evaluated as part of the strategic rail review which was undertaken on behalf of the Department of Transport and published in 2003. It was not included in the review&rsquo;s recommended investment strategy because, among other things, it was not supported by complementary land use and settlement strategies at that time. The Minister for Transport has stated before that such strategies are essential for the viability of any public transport project because they provide the basis for the travel demand that would justify the level of capital investment, put at approximately &euro;400 million in current terms.</P>
        <P>The western rail corridor was, however, identified by the review as fitting particularly well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, particularly in terms of balanced regional development. To explore fully the issues surrounding the development of this corridor and to allow an opportunity for all aspects of the proposal to be examined, the then Minister for Transport established a working group in 2004. This group, chaired by Mr. Pat McCann, group chief executive of Jurys Doyle hotel group, provided a forum for the proponents of the western rail corridor to put their case to the chairman of the group, as well as to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, CIE and the Department of Transport. The working group met in plenary session on four occasions after its establishment. The group and its sub-groups have now concluded their deliberations and the chairman of the working group delivered his report to the Minister for Transport on 10 May last.</P>
        <P>The chairman&rsquo;s report identifies five main sections of the proposed western rail corridor and proposes that much of it be restored on a phased basis subject to various conditions and reservations. The report recommends that a line survey be carried out on the Athenry to Ennis section with a view to re-opening it in the short term. This would provide direct rail links between Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork and implement one of the main national spatial strategy objectives of creating greater linkages between these four cities. While the Athenry to Galway section is not strictly part of the western rail corridor, the report recommends that improvements on this section would be necessary for Galway-Limerick services to become a reality. The report suggests that a commuter rail service between Athenry and Galway could also be developed relatively quickly and inexpensively.</P>
        <P>According to the report&rsquo;s recommendations, the next section to be considered for restoration <Col N="1576"/>should be the Tuam to Athenry section. It notes that the introduction of a rail service between Tuam and Galway city would serve to strengthen linkages and advance the objectives of the national spatial strategy for the region. Restoring this section would also provide connections to Dublin-Galway intercity train services and the cities and towns to the south via the Athenry-Ennis section. The report concludes that in the short term a commuter service to Galway should be introduced.</P>
        <P>The report notes that the restoration of the line from Tuam to Claremorris would link up the western rail corridor with the Castlebar to Westport and Ballina lines and thereby link these Mayo hub-towns with Galway and the cities in Munster. The development of rail freight could also make this section more viable and the report therefore recommends that a thorough study to quantify the potential for rail freight in the region be initiated.</P>
        <P>The section from Claremorris to Collooney would be by far the most expensive to restore, accounting for 54% of the restoration costs of the entire line. As things stand, the report finds that the case for its restoration is weak. This section is characterised by low population densities with few towns of reasonable size. However, the report acknowledges that restoration of this section would connect, by rail, the Sligo gateway with the other gateways and hubs on the western and southern seaboards. For this reason, it recommends that the section should be preserved in its entirety, that Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo county councils should make the necessary arrangements as soon as possible and that the viability of restoring this section should be reviewed in three years to see whether the objective conditions for line restoration have changed.</P>
        <P>The report also recommends that an implementation group be established to oversee the implementation of the report. The full report is available on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Upon receipt of Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report, the Minister for Transport requested his officials to examine the content to ensure that it is fully appraised in advance of the final preparation of the multi-­annual capital investment framework for transport, as it is in that context that decisions will be made on the future of the western rail corridor. I understand that the framework is being finalised at present and the Minister expects to be in a position to bring his proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <sTitle>School Transport.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise the denial of school transport for 26 pupils from the Dunbeacon area of west Cork to Schull community college. This year marks the re-establishment of <Col N="1577"/>an historic injustice perpetrated by the Government against the parents from the Dunbeacon-Goleen area in west Cork and their children who attend Schull community college. No school transport is being provided this year for the 26 pupils who live four or five miles from and attend that school. An excuse has been given that the arrangement for school transport made last year by the school with the support of the County Cork Vocational Education Committee was exceptional pending a longer-term solution. The only solution offered by the Government this year is to leave them to their own devices and return them to school transport limbo.</P>
        <P>Another excuse that will be offered by the Minister of State is that the pupils in question reside within the Bantry catchment area. This is not correct and I will explain why. I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il some years ago with the former Minister for Education and Science, under Question No. 799 of 6 November 2001. In the reply I discovered that the catchment boundaries were established in the late 1960s in the context of the free education scheme. There were no specific regulations accompanying the determination of catchment areas. Effectively, parish boundaries determined them and revision would take place as the need arose. At that time the catchment boundary extended along the Mizen peninsula between Bantry and Skibbereen. Schull community college did not exist at that time. It was not built until 20 years later and the new catchment boundary between Schull and Bantry was never established.</P>
        <P>It was parents such as those from the Dunbeacon area who campaigned for the school in Schull and naturally sent their children there. Why would they not? It is only four or five miles away. They lived in the same parish, which the Minister of State defines as a relevant consideration. They had been to a primary school in the same parish and had been going there since the local primary school in Dunbeacon had closed. A new catchment area boundary was established between Skibbereen and Schull, including provision of a common catchment area east of Ballydehob, but no catchment boundary was agreed or established between Bantry and Schull. No school transport was provided until the temporary arrangement last year.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will say that the pupils from the Dunbeacon area reside in the Bantry catchment area and are fully eligible for transport to that post-primary centre only. I challenge that assertion; it is not correct. Apart from the ludicrous fact that the distance involved varies from ten to 15 miles, no school bus service is, has been or ever will be provided to Bantry from that area. County Cork VEC came up with a proposal last year and this year it is blocked because of stupid and ridiculous Civil Service gobbledygook that states it encroaches into the Bantry area. No <Col N="1578"/>boundary was ever agreed. There were no specific regulations. There should have been a revision on account of the new school but it never took place.</P>
        <P>All that is needed now is the political will to get rid of this anachronism. If the Government continues to fail the parents and the pupils from the Dunbeacon area, a number of consequences will follow. They will be left in limbo as far as school transport goes. No transport will be provided to Bantry and transport will be refused to a school that they, their sisters and brothers and some of their parents went to since Schull community college was established. The cost is upwards of &euro;1,000 per child. That is the penalty being placed on these parents. A private bus had been arranged by the parents in the past, but it clearly fell by the wayside with the temporary arrangement last year. These people are now left in limbo, with many informal arrangements for getting to school. Some parents drive in and out twice a day. Another issue that concerns me are informal arrangements where pupils themselves are driving to school and bringing colleagues.</P>

        <P>Does the Minister of State know this area? Travelling in Mount Gabriel involves going over mountainous roads in rural Ireland. Does the Minister of State realise what could arise if an accident occurred involving those inexperienced drivers? If that happens, this Government will bear the responsibility, as it will be the consequence of what the Government is forcing these people to do. There is also the consequences of the disadvantage that these pupils are at with regard to education and points attainment in the competitive world of the Leaving Certificate.</P>
        <P>Let us have an end to the Dunbeacon educational anachronism. It can be done and a boundary or common catchment area, or both, should be created. We should move on this issue now and if a political will is there it can be done. If such a will is not there, the Government will bear complete responsibility for the consequences.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe for raising the matter on the Adjournment as it gives me the opportunity to outline to the House my position regarding school transport in respect of pupils from the Dunbeacon area travelling to Schull community college in County Cork.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By way of general comment, I should explain that one of the main objects of the school transport scheme is to provide a basic level of service for children who live long distances from schools and who might otherwise experience difficulty in attending regularly. There are approximately 135,000 primary and post-­primary pupils using the school transport scheme on a regular basis. At post-primary level the country is divided into <Col N="1579"/>catchment areas, with each catchment area having a post-primary centre. A pupil is eligible for transport if he or she resides 4.8 kilometres, three miles, or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which he or she lives. A school transport service will usually be established if there are at least seven pupils residing in a distinct locality. If it is not economically viable to establish a service, the parent of an eligible pupil may be paid a remote area grant to assist with the cost of making private transport arrangements. The maximum grant payable is &euro;5.10 per day based on distance.</P>
        <P>School transport services are operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should deal with the issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>At second level, the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees assist Bus &Eacute;ireann by acting as transport liaison officers. Post-primary pupils who are eligible for school transport to the post-primary centre in their own catchment area may sometimes elect to attend a post-primary centre in a different catchment area to the one in which they reside. In such circumstances, these pupils may apply for school transport to the post-primary centre they have chosen to attend. However, such pupils will only be offered transport if there are <Col N="1580"/>spare seats available on the relevant bus after all eligible pupils have been accommodated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should deal with the issues. This is ridiculous rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Such pupils are referred to as catchment boundary pupils. Pupils from the Dunbeacon area reside in the Bantry catchment area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not so, as I pointed out. The Minister of State should deal with the points raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>These pupils are fully eligible for transport to the Bantry post-primary centre. I must point out, however, that under the school transport scheme these pupils are not eligible for transport to Schull community college.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be eligible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>They may apply, in the normal way, for catchment boundary transport to that college. It may be of interest to the Deputy that I understand that approaches have been made by the transport liaison officer from Cork VEC to initiate discussion on a common catchment area between Bantry and Schull schools. These approaches have been rejected at local level.</P>

	<P>I see as a priority supporting people to stay in their own homes and communities and moving away from the practice of placing people in residential care as a first option. This is the express wish of the majority of our older people.</P>
        <P>The Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined all issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. Following the publication of this report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, has been established.</P>
        <P>The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including improvements in community care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group will report to me and to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, shortly.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The national treatment purchase fund has reported that, in most instances, anyone waiting more than three months for a routine sur<Col N="1582"/>gical procedure will be facilitated by the fund. A patient may contact the fund directly or through his or her general practitioner, hospital or consultant to have his or her treatment arranged. The fund has pointed out, however, that in certain cases, for reasons of clinical or patient complexity, it may not be possible for the fund to arrange treatment immediately.</P>
        <P>Up to the end of September over 35,000 patients have had treatment arranged for them by the national treatment purchase fund. The fund has made significant progress in reducing waiting times for patients.</P>
        <P>I launched the NTPF new patient treatment register, PTR, in early September. The PTR is a new national database of patients waiting for admission to hospital for treatment. The register will allow for more accurate identification of waiting lists and, more importantly, waiting times. The first phase of the register was implemented in September 2005. Phase 1 of the project includes data from seven hospitals which, under the previous waiting list system, accounted for approximately 40% of the total number of patients waiting nationally. The published data for the seven hospitals showed that patients are waiting between two to four months for their operation for 17 out of the 20 most common surgical procedures.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which 83% of hip replacements were done in a public hospital under the national treatment purchase fund, which was established to carry out procedures that could not be carried out in the public sector to be carried out in the private sector; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, was established as one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists arising from the 2001 health strategy. The strategy envisaged that the NTPF might make use of any capacity within public hospitals to arrange treatment for public patients. It was recognised that during the start-up phase of the fund, the use of public capacity could account for 30% of total NTPF activity, once public core service planned activity was not compromised. The Department has recently advised NTPF that use by the fund of public facilities should be limited to 10% of its total referrals for treatment.</P>
        <P>The majority of elective orthopaedic surgery, including hip replacements, takes place in public elective orthopaedic facilities which do not provide accident and emergency services. As elective activity in these hospitals does not take place 24 hours per day and seven days a week, using theatres and beds outside of normal work<Col N="1583"/>ing hours is one way of creating extra elective capacity in the public system. Allowing public hospitals to undertake work under the NTPF initiative also incentivises hospitals to perform extra work and to treat more patients over and above core funded activity. This activity is carried out often by staff working overtime, who come in at weekends or who extend theatre time on occasions.</P>
        <P>Other situations that compelled the use of public or &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; capacity were cases where, for reasons of clinical or patient complexity, it was clearly best practice to have certain patients treated by their own consultant in the hospital where they were on the waiting list. Not to have used this facility would have effectively barred this cohort of patients from accessing the NTPF scheme.</P>

	<P>The National Economic and Social Forum, NESF, report on early childhood care and education was presented to the Government on 20 September 2005. The Government welcomes the publication of this report, which focuses on developing a long-term vision for the provision of integrated early years services for children from birth to six years of age.</P>
        <P>The NESF has a mandate from Government to monitor and analyse measures and programmes concerned with achieving equality and social inclusion and to facilitate dialogue and discussion on these issues. The Government is committed to continuing to develop relevant policies to support child care and early education and the NESF provides a vital forum for discussion and debate by politicians and many interest groupings in our society. The report provides a welcome and valuable input into policy development in the future in this area.</P>
        <P>A high level working group on early childhood care and education was established by the Cabinet committee on children to consider these important issues. The terms of reference of the group, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, were &ldquo;to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education which will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level and which incorporates a child centred approach to service delivery.&rdquo; The Government asked the high level group on early childhood care and education to consider the <Col N="1584"/>recommendations of the NESF report as part of its deliberations. The NESF report has contributed to the preparation of an options paper prepared by the group for the Cabinet committee on children earlier this month and which is currently under consideration.</P>

	<P>I wish to offer my deepest sympathies to the family of the late Mr. Patrick Walsh, RIP, who died tragically at Monaghan General Hospital last Friday. This should not have happened. I have now been informed that there was an intensive care bed vacant in Cavan General Hospital when Mr. Walsh needed to be transferred. The circumstances surrounding this tragedy require thorough investigation.</P>
        <P>Mr. Patrick Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital, and an honorary senior lecturer at Queens University, will carry out an independent and external review of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Walsh&rsquo;s death. This review will be completed and a report issued within an eight week timeframe. I look forward to this review answering all the questions around this tragic case as a matter of urgent public interest.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question, the current position regarding services at Monaghan General Hospital is as follows. Monaghan General Hospital went back on call for medical emergencies in January 2005 and five NCHDs were recruited to facilitate the return of the hospital to medical on-call. A larger treatment room is to be opened on a 24 hour, seven day basis. A capital grant of &euro;750,000 was provided to upgrade the treatment room facilities at the hospital. Construction work commenced in October 2004 and was completed recently. The development consists of a two bay resuscitation facility, two clinical examination rooms and two minor injuries rooms with associated ancillary accommodation. The HSE has advised that it is currently working to ensure that this expanded facility is available as soon as possible. In this regard, the executive will be working with all relevant stakeholders regarding referral protocols.</P>
        <P>With regard to provision of a CT scanner, a regional procurement group has been set up within the HSE north eastern area to examine the provision of CT services within the north east and it is expected to issue its report in the near future. <Col N="1585"/>Three surgical posts are to be provided for the joint department of surgery, Cavan-Monaghan. Interviews were held for these posts and contracts have been issued to the three successful candidates. Selective elective surgery is being provided at Monaghan General Hospital consistent with the recommendations of the steering group report on the joint department of surgery. The scope of this service is expected to increase when the full surgical team is in place.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>A group was established in 2001 by my predecessor to examine, among other issues, the feasibility of introducing a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; compensation scheme for infants who sustain brain damage at, or close to, the time of birth.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two main reasons were advanced for the establishment of the group. First, there existed a body of opinion which believed that the conventional tort system was not best suited to establishing the reasons some infants suffered brain damage before, or during, birth. Uncertainty about the precise cause of the resulting disability was believed to give rise to inconsistencies in the making of awards by the courts. Second, the increasing size of awards made by the courts to brain damaged infants was leading to unsustainable increases in the cost of public liability insurance for health boards and hospitals with maternity units and to similar increases in the cost of professional indemnity cover for consultant obstetricians.</P>
        <P>The group was chaired by Dr. Peter McKenna who was then master of the Rotunda Hospital. It included representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Faculty of Paediatrics, the Incorporated Law Society, the Bar Council of Ireland, an academic expert on medico-legal issues and representatives of Justice and Equality for Brain Injured Babies. The group undertook an intensive work programme over the following two years. At an advanced stage in its activities in early 2003 it had to suspend its work due to hospital consultants&rsquo; withdrawal of co-operation with ministerial working groups as part of the consultants&rsquo; opposition to the introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme. The group has not met since that time.</P>
        <P>In the interim, advice received from the Attorney General about another proposed no fault compensation scheme has raised a number <Col N="1586"/>of constitutional issues which throws doubt on the feasibility of establishing such schemes in Ireland. I am conscious of the huge amount of work which Dr. McKenna and his colleagues on the group invested in this exercise and I hope to meet him in the next few weeks to discuss how the group&rsquo;s analysis and conclusions to date might be made use of by my own Department and other interested agencies.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the clinical indemnity scheme has removed the need for health boards and hospitals to purchase public liability insurance cover for clinical negligence claims. The Government has put in place arrangements which effectively cap the amount of professional indemnity cover which consultant obstetricians in private practice need to purchase at &euro;500,000 for any one claim with a further aggregate cap of &euro;1.5 million per consultant in any one year. These provisions have removed the threat which spiralling insurance costs had posed to the availability of maternity services.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is currently being collated within my Department and will be made available shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department applies stringent controls on the employment of external consultancy assistance. A business case must be prepared to support the need for the consultancy and approved at either principal officer or MAC level as appropriate. Funding to support the procurement, which can be project specific or from within the Department&rsquo;s administrative budget, must be identified and approved before any commitment is made. The procurement of all consultancies must comply with public procurement law, which covers such items as European rules, and also must comply with national guidelines. Once awarded, the procurement contract must then be managed in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s best practice protocols.</P>
        <P>Deputies will also be aware that, in addition to measures to ensure the appropriate use of consultancy assistance across the Civil Service as announced by the Government last week, I have recently introduced measures within my own Department to ensure that all such contracts receive my approval.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 204 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the national task force on medical staffing or Hanly report made a series of important recommendations about the development of hospital services. These covered issues such as: the changes needed in NCHD work patterns; reform of medical education and training; the need for a significantly revised contract for medical consultants and an increase in the number of consultants; the reorganisation of acute hospital services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is working closely with the HSE to build on, and progress, these recom<Col N="1590"/>mendations. I am pleased that the IMO and the IHCA have now agreed to enter into negotiations on a new contract for consultants. It is important that a new contract be put in place as soon as possible. I also want the discussions, which have been under way for some time, about the work patterns of NCHDs to be brought to a successful conclusion at an early date. I am currently considering a report from the medical education and training group relating to postgraduate medical education and training. I hope to bring proposals in this regard to the Government soon in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, who is considering the recommendations of the Fottrel report.</P>
        <P>These measures, combined with ongoing investment in acute hospital facilities, extra consultant posts and the organisation of services around hospital networks, are designed to provide patients with faster access to high quality consultant provided services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 110 and 176 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. As part of the reform of the health service a national ambulance office has been established under the auspices of the national hospitals office within the HSE. The office has responsibility for the provision of pre-hospital emergency care nationally, including the development of the &ldquo;first responder&rdquo; service where required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report of the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Services, 2001 has largely formed the basis for the development of pre-hospital emergency medical services in recent years. One of the recommendations in that report is that all ambulance services should consider setting up first responder programmes to support the ambulance service. Consistent with this recommendation, the HSE eastern region trained over 1,000 people last year in cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the community. My Department is advised that there are a number of community first responder schemes operating in County Wicklow. The Executive has advised that it intends to progress the further roll-out of the community first responder scheme, subject to the pre-hospital care needs of particular regions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the question from Deputy McManus, ambulance services in the eastern region are provided by the HSE and Dublin City Council through Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB. The HSE eastern regional area provides services in counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow while the DFB largely operates in Dublin city under an <Col N="1592"/>arrangement with the executive. The HSE has overall responsibility for the provision of ambulance services and allocates funding annually to Dublin City Council.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the former Eastern Regional Health Authority commissioned a review of an integration agreement relating to the operation of the command and control centre at Townsend Street, Dublin. The centre is staffed by ambulance personnel from the HSE and the DFB. The review was commissioned arising from difficulties which had arisen in operating the centre in a fully integrated fashion. The review was conducted by an independent management consultant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principal recommendation arising from the review was that discussions should take place at senior management level between Dublin City Council and the Health Service Executive. Among the issues to be considered are: the need to establish a fully integrated joint ambulance control based in Townsend Street staffed jointly by the HSE and DFB; the need to ensure that previously agreed protocols on the dispatch of emergency ambulance services are implemented and monitored; and the need for a single information and communication technology system to be introduced for the dispatch of emergency ambulances.</P>
        <P>My Department is advised that the national hospitals office has since had preliminary discussions with Dublin City Council to discuss the implications of the report and with a view to setting up the senior management group as recommended. My Department is further advised that the composition of the group has been agreed and that it is scheduled to meet later this month. The review further recommended that in the absence of agreement to the resolution of difficulties which have arisen in the operation of a fully integrated centre, the HSE should commission a risk management audit to assess the risks to patients arising from a continuation of the existing arrangements at Townsend Street.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly support the recommendations in the report. Furthermore, I consider that risk management-audit should form an integral part of any future arrangements governing the provision of ambulance services nationally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>All aspects of the drug delivery system, from the manufacturer to the patient, are <Col N="1593"/>currently under review. A number of proposals, including better access to generic drugs and supply chain costs such as pharmacy mark-ups, are being considered with a view to addressing the rapidly rising costs in medicines expenditure both by the State and by private individuals. I must stress that no single measure will achieve this by itself. Indeed, international experience has shown that this is a very difficult task, as the sophistication and range of treatments continue to increase along with, quite justifiably, increased expectations on the part of patients.</P>
        <P>With regard to increased use of generic medicines, it is my intention to give patients, and ultimately the taxpayer as the biggest buyer of drugs, better access to generic drugs where this is possible and appropriate. My Department has begun preparatory work for the introduction of structures appropriate to the Irish drug schemes. In addition, negotiations will shortly commence for a new national pricing and supply agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland, APMI, for supply of medicines to the health services and it is intended to address this issue within that agreement.</P>
        <P>In regard to pharmacy fees, both my Department and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union agree that the current remuneration system is inappropriate and in need of revision. My Department is considering proposals to address the anomalies in the current system, with a view to creating fairness and equity across the drug schemes in terms of how pharmacists are paid for their professional services under the community pharmacy contract.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 112, 118, 124 and 152 together.</P>
        <P>I have been advised that the Health Service Executive is currently considering a proposal to put in place, as part of its national hospitals office, four administrative regions for hospital services. These are the western region, Dublin/north-east region, southern region and Dublin/mid-Leinster region. This proposal, if implemented, would not necessarily mean a reduction in the existing ten hospital networks. The proposed administrative regions for acute hospital services would be the same as the existing four regional structures for delivering primary, community and continuing care.</P>
        <P>I understand that the aim of the proposal, which is still being considered within the HSE, is to achieve greater co-ordination of service delivery at regional level. It recognises that one of the problems to date with the health service is the lack of co-ordination between the acute services and the community services. A seamless delivery of services is the key to meeting patient needs and requirements. Lack of cohesion in this area has led to people accessing services in inappropriate settings. Co-ordination is an essential component in the spectrum of health care provision required to achieve responsive and appropriate delivery.</P>
        <P>It is entirely for the board of the HSE to decide how best to organise the management and delivery of health and personal social services. Any measures which impact positively on patients will have my support.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 134 and 177 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act <Col N="1596"/>2004. The national hospitals office is organised into networks. Within each network, hospitals provide full CAT scanning services in one of three ways, on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on-call for emergencies outside normal working hours, or at neighbouring hospitals. The table outlines the numbers of scanners in each hospital and their hours of operation.</P><Col N="1595"/>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 185, 212 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>The primary care strategy aims to develop services in the community so that patients will have direct access to integrated multi-disciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, home helps, occupational therapists and others. The principles set out in the strategy remain Government policy and this document provides a template for the development of primary care services over a period of ten to 15 years. However, the successful implementation of the strategy is about much more than the provision of additional funding. It is first and foremost about developing new ways of working and of reorganising the resources already in the system in line with the service model described in <Col N="1602"/>the strategy. It is in that context that additional resources can be deployed to best effect.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the primary care strategy will require sustained investment, over a period, to expand capacity and enable primary care to become the cornerstone of our health system. Three broad approaches will be taken to enable this to happen, namely, the substantial reorganisation of resources to which I have already referred; further revenue and capital investment by the State to deliver additional services; and a structured role for the private sector in the development of facilities and possibly also the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>The strategy estimated the capital cost of developing a primary care facility at some &euro;2.5 million for each team, which is approximately &euro;1.27 billion for the first 400 to 600 teams. The additional staffing costs involved, allowing for the availability of existing staff and taking account of the composition of typical core teams and the associated network professionals, were estimated to amount to approximately &euro;615 million per annum for the first 400 to 600 teams. The strategy also estimated that up to &euro;63 million in once-off costs and running costs of &euro;12.7 million per annum would be required for ICT supports. However, the required investment can come from a range of sources and not solely from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>With regard to implementation, one of the first steps was to establish an initial group of ten primary care teams, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented. These teams were intended to demonstrate the primary care model in action and also to enable practical experience to be gained of the process involved in developing a primary care team and expanding the range of services available.</P>
        <P>In 2005, I provided an additional &euro;5 million in revenue funding to support the implementation of the primary care strategy. Coupled with the &euro;5 million allocated in 2002 and the &euro;2 million in <Col N="1603"/>2003, this brings total ongoing additional revenue funding to &euro;12 million per annum. To date, capital funding of &euro;2.725 million and a further &euro;1.8 million in respect of ICT supports have been provided for the initial primary care teams. Funding has also been applied to a range of other initiatives intended to advance implementation. These include: planning and mapping work by the HSE; service developments in specific locations; a review of ICT needs in primary care; support to university departments of general practice and the Irish College of General Practitioners; research fellowships in primary care.</P>
        <P>In light of the considerable private sector interest in the development of hospitals and long-term care services, I envisage much potential for such developments in primary care to complement investment by the State. I have asked my Department to consider, in conjunction with the HSE, how this agenda can be advanced in a way that will harness this undoubted potential within the non-State sector and so enable and support the delivery of integrated primary care services in line with national policy.</P>
        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions are also relevant to the management and delivery of health and personal social services which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, under the Health Act 2004. The chief executive officer of the HSE has emphasised the importance of developing our primary care services, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement services provided by our acute hospitals. This is an important priority of the executive which has my full endorsement.</P>

	<P>An analysis by the national cancer registry of treatment data for the years 1994 to 2001 for the commonest cancers showed that treatment rates for chemotherapy and radiotherapy and, to a lesser extent surgery, declined with age.</P>
        <P>Information on reasons for treatment choices in Ireland is limited. However, lower rates of cancer treatment in older patients have been widely reported from many countries. This decline in treatment rates with age is multifactorial. Older <Col N="1604"/>patients tend to present at a later stage with cancer, when curative treatment may not be an option. Older people often have additional medical conditions that are associated with age such as respiratory, cardiac and renal conditions. These conditions can limit treatment options for cancer. Cancer is often a less aggressive disease in older people. In some cases decisions are required in consultation with patients which balance stress of treatment with possible benefits.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making a full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients, including elderly patients, throughout Ireland in line with best international standards.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 137, 143, 151, 201 and 206 together.</P>
        <P>The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, was established as one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists arising from <Col N="1606"/>the 2001 health strategy. The strategy envisaged that the NTPF might make use of any capacity within public hospitals to arrange treatment for public patients. It was recognised that during the start-up phase of the fund, the use of public capacity could account for 30% of total NTPF activity, once public core service planned activity was not compromised. The Department has recently advised NTPF that use by the fund of public facilities should be limited to 10% of its total referrals for treatment. The allocation available to the fund in 2005 is &euro;64 million.</P>
        <P>The majority of elective orthopaedic surgery, including hip replacements, takes place in public elective orthopaedic facilities which do not provide accident and emergency services. As elective activity in these hospitals does not take place 24 hours per day and seven days a week, using theatres and beds outside of normal working hours is one way of creating extra elective capacity in the public system. Allowing public hospitals to undertake work under the NTPF initiative also incentivises hospitals to perform extra work and to treat more patients over and above core funded activity. This activity is carried out often by staff working overtime, who come in at weekends or who extend theatre time on occasions.</P>
        <P>Other situations that compelled the use of public or &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; capacity were cases where, for reasons of clinical or patient complexity, it was clearly best practice to have certain patients treated by their own consultant in the hospital where they were on the waiting list. Not to have used this facility would have effectively barred this cohort of patients from accessing the NTPF scheme.</P>
        <P>With regard to the transport of patients, the policy of the NTPF is to provide transport for patients where it is deemed medically necessary or where there are people with special needs, for example, the elderly or the infirm. The number of patients that require transport is small. In the case of a patient going abroad for treatment the travel costs are paid for by the NTPF. The authorisation of transport is considered on an individual basis, particularly in circumstances where lack of transport would present a barrier to a patient being treated. Otherwise patients are responsible for their own transport to hospital for treatment.</P>
        <P>In the context of his examination of my Department&rsquo;s appropriations account for 2004, the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out a review of the operation of the NTPF in 2004. During his review the Comptroller and Auditor General received the full and comprehensive co-operation of the fund and of my Department. The responses from the fund and my Department to the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report have been fully recorded in the text of the report and are a matter of public record. As a statutory body funded by the <Col N="1607"/>Exchequer, the annual accounts of the national treatment purchase fund will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The fund&rsquo;s accounts for 2004 are currently being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It is a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General to decide which State organisations or State funded programmes are to be the subject of value for money audits.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I decided last June not to commence risk equalisation transfers, having considered the recommendation of the Health Insurance Authority and the subsequent representations made by health insurance undertakings. This also allows time for further corroboration of observed trends in the market. I am due to receive the authority&rsquo;s fourth report by the end of this month.</P>
        <P>The VHI has made a number of representations highlighting the need for risk equalisation. Following my decision not to introduce risk equalisation last June, the VHI, within the context of its submission outlining its proposed price increase, and in a separate submission on the company&rsquo;s annual report and accounts, has continued to emphasise the significance of risk equalisation for the future of the company.</P>
        <P>The provisions of the Health Insurance Acts provide that in considering whether risk equalisation transfers are warranted in the best overall interests of health insurance consumers, there should be reference to the need to maintain the application of community rating across the market and to facilitate competition between undertakings. Any decision on the commencement of risk equalisation cannot therefore be taken by reference only to the position of any one company in the market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>There has been no alteration to Government policy on employment ceilings in the public sector, including the health service. Employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with Government policy on public sector employment and also to take account of specific policy measures aimed at increasing service levels for patients. The employment ceiling for the health service currently stands at 97,550, in wholetime equivalent terms. This ceiling reflects not only the 600 post adjustment required by the Government decision on public sector numbers but also includes an increase of 1,200 posts in respect of the opening of new units in 2005. Further increases in the employment ceiling for the health service in 2005 are being finalised by my Department and the Department of Finance in respect of both the accident and emergency initiative and the Disabilities Act 2005.</P>
        <P>I have repeatedly stressed the need for compliance with approved employment levels consistent with safeguarding and, indeed, enhancing the delivery of front line services and achieving an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical employment levels in the health service. This has been underlined by my Department in direct discussions with the HSE&rsquo;s senior management team and in the context of the finalisation of the executive&rsquo;s national service plan for 2005. I believe there is a general consensus that the organisation of human resources is critical to good service delivery.</P>
        <P>The proper management of employment levels and skill mix together with the prioritisation of front line services is, of course, central to the organisation of human resources and is the most effective mechanism for ensuring the best use of resources overall within the health service. My Department will continue to work closely with the HSE in this matter.</P>

	<P>An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to expand public hospital beds in line with the health strategy commitment to increase total acute hospital bed capacity by 3,000 by 2011. Substantial investment in additional bed capacity in acute hospitals has already taken place.</P>
        <P>Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds/day places in public acute hospitals throughout the country. The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that as of 14 October 2005, 806 of these beds/day places were in place and the remaining 94 beds/day places will come on stream over the coming months.</P>
        <P>In addition, a further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Capital Investment Framework 2005-2009. I announced in July this year an initiative which will provide up to an additional 1,000 beds for public patients in public hospitals over the next five years. The Health Service Executive, HSE, has been asked to begin to develop an implementation plan and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals&rsquo; requirement for additional bed capacity. Initial discussions have already taken place between my Department and the HSE on this matter.</P>
        <P>These additional beds/day places will go most of the way to achieving our commitment in the programme for Government to increase total <Col N="1610"/>acute hospital capacity. The health strategy acknowledges that a significant proportion of additional capacity in the acute hospital system will be supplied in future by private providers. My Department, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, will review public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in light of developments since the health strategy was published and the progress of the initiative I announced in July.</P>

        <P>On the issue of future manpower requirements for general practitioners, my Department has met with the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and accepted in principle its recommendation to increase the number of trainee places on GP vocational training schemes from 84 to 150 on a phased basis, providing 22 additional places each year over three years. Accordingly, funding was provided to the Health Service Executive in 2005 to enable an additional 22 GP trainees to be taken on in the 2005-06 academic year. I understand that the ICGP is in the process of making further proposals in this area and my Department will, in conjunction with the HSE, consider these when they are received.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity. The health strategy recognises that additional capacity will be provided in the future by a combination of public and private providers. In July this year, my Department issued a policy direction to the Health Service Executive which is aimed at freeing up additional beds for public patients in public hospitals through the development of private hospital facilities on public hospital sites. The initiative will provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients over the next five years.</P>
        <P>The Health Services Executive, HSE, has been asked to begin to develop an implementation plan which will identify where these private facilities might be located and to prioritise proposals with reference to the public hospitals&rsquo; requirement for additional bed capacity. Initial discussions have already taken place between my Department and the HSE on this matter.</P>
        <P>I consider that this approach offers better value for money to the Exchequer compared to the traditional approach which would require the Exchequer to cover the full capital costs and to meet, on an ongoing basis, the full staffing and running costs of additional beds. The assessment framework which has been issued to the HSE will require it to undertake a rigorous economic assessment of each individual proposal, which includes estimating the costs to the Exchequer, including tax foregone, and the benefits of the proposed development.</P>

The terms of the current general medical service GP contracts which are held with the HSE require GPs to provide services for 40 hours each week and to put in place suitable arrangements to allow public patients access to services outside of these hours for urgent cases. Such arrangements are a matter between the HSE and the individual contractor.</P>
        <P>The provision of more general practitioner out of hours services is an important element of the ten point plan for accident and emergency services. The decision of the HSE to engage in a public procurement process to put in place arrangements intended to complement and enhance existing out of hours GP services for the north Dublin area has my support. The HSE has indicated to me that its experience in putting this additional service in place will inform future decisions about meeting service needs.</P>

	<P>The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, sets out this Government&rsquo;s vision for the development of health and personal social services into the future. The strategy sets out the key objectives for the health system: better health for everyone; fair access; responsive and appropriate care delivery; high performance. To achieve these objectives it is recognised that major change needs to take place in the health system, including organisational reform, strengthening primary care, reforming the acute hospital system and developing information.</P>
        <P>The national health strategy is backed up by numerous reports which deal with specific areas mentioned above. These reports include: &ldquo;Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Services&rdquo;, Brennan; &ldquo;Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System&rdquo;, Prospectus; &ldquo;Primary Care &mdash; A New Direction&rdquo;; &ldquo;Acute Hospital Bed Capacity &mdash; A National Review&rdquo;; &ldquo;Health Information &mdash; A National Strategy&rdquo; and &ldquo;National Task Force on Medical Staffing&rdquo;, Hanly.

Responsibility for building on the recommendations of the report regarding the organisation of hospital services has been transferred from the Department to the national hospitals office, NHO, of the Health Service Executive. The NHO&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that patients, wherever they live, have equitable and rapid access to high quality hospital care.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 199 together.</P>
        <P>In 1995 a steering group composed of representatives of the health boards was formed to modernise and reform payroll and personnel systems. In 1997, the CEO group sought funding from the Department of Health and Children to support work on the project and to proceed with the implementation of a new system. In 1998, a sum of £7 million was provided to assist with the implementation of the system during the years 1998-2000. In addition, the Department requested the health boards to supplement new capital where necessary with their existing resources, including locally generated funds from the sale of surplus assets.</P>
        <P>In 2001, following shared concerns between the CEO group and the Department, a quality assurance review and investment appraisal was commissioned on the project. This was carried out by Hay Management Consultants and it stated that the project should proceed but that the original costing had been understated. In March 2002 it set the revised costs at &euro;107 million and underlined the need to manage the risks of the project by the health boards. In May 2002, the Department wrote to the health boards indicating that national coverage was an essential element and, given the escalation in costs, that the project would have to have assertive negotiations with suppliers and ensure vigorous project management arrangements.</P>
        <P>In 2004, due to concerns regarding the consultancy and staff costs, an independent review was commissioned and carried out by Gartner. While this concluded that the costs were within industry norms, it was nevertheless a very high and significant cost. The Department raised those issues with the health boards and urged all parties involved to ensure best value for project expenditure and indicated that significant discounts should apply on such a large project. In reply the health boards indicated that significant discounts had been obtained and that factors such as the scale of the programme, organisational complexity, level of variances between agencies and so forth significantly contributed to the cost of PPARS.</P>
        <P>The basis of the PPARS and FISP contracts are as follows: PPARS &mdash; SAP Software licences and annual maintenance; IBM &mdash; managed service contract, technical consulting contract &mdash; these two contracts also covered the FISP project; Deloitte Consulting UK &mdash; programme management, business process design, change management &mdash; this contract was the<i> per diem</i> rates &mdash; no fixed overall contract price.</P>
        <P>The FISP contract is based on fixed price with payment by results, that is, production of project deliverables at defined milestone date. Deloitte is the primary contractor. IBM is the technical <Col N="1616"/>implementation partner &mdash; subcontractors to Deloitte.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, the HSE became a statutory authority with its own vote, with new governance structures and arrangements. As soon as major difficulties with the project were brought to my attention, the Secretary General of my Department met with the HSE and the Department of Finance. This meeting led to the establishment of a review of the system by the HSE and to the decision of the HSE of 6 October 2005.</P>
        <P>The roll out of the PPARS project to other areas of the country has been suspended by the HSE pending further examination. The HSE is setting up a group to establish the long-term value of PPARS by developing a business case to show the full lifetime costs of the project over the next five years, to evaluate any other options to deliver on the HSE&rsquo;s requirement of an integrated payroll/HR management system and to determine the most cost effective and efficient option for the HSE. The Comptroller and Auditor General is carrying out a value for money examination of the PPARS project, which is expected to look at issues such as the development, governance and management of the project.</P>
        <P>The appropriate steps have, therefore, been taken at this stage. With regard to the financial information systems project, FISP, the HSE has also decided to pause this project and evaluate it further. Unlike PPARS, this project is at a much earlier stage of development.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided on a number of new measures to improve the management of consultancies. The level of engagement of consultancies in any Department/agency will necessarily reflect their specific circumstances and the following measures have now been approved. In the context of the formulation of the 2006 Estimates, Ministers will review the financial provisions for consultancy and, in that context, will confirm that the guidelines are being applied in their Departments and that proposed expenditure is necessary. The Department of Finance has been asked to review existing guidelines on the commissioning and management of consultancies to ensure that they accord with best practice and the Government is instructing Secretaries General/Accounting Officers to certify compliance with the terms of the guidelines in respect of major projects.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 211 together.</P>
        <P>The health strategy identified a requirement for additional capacity throughout the health system and a need to reconfigure services to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness. The concerns about capacity and the configuration of services underline the need for ongoing investment, expansion of acute hospital services and substantial strengthening of primary care and community services. There is a need to build up primary care, community services and acute hospital capacity and reform the health system to underpin the achievement of this objective.</P>
        <P>The decision to increase the number of beds in acute hospitals was taken on foot of a detailed national review of bed capacity. The report recognises that acute hospital care is just one component of the health care delivery system. Hospital services cannot be evaluated in isolation from primary care, community and specialist services. The need for hospital services is influenced by the availability and accessibility of those services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the bed capacity review, the Government&rsquo;s health strategy identified a requirement for 3,000 beds in the acute hospital system. Government policy has tackled this in the following ways. Funding has been provided to open an additional 900 inpatient beds and day places in acute hospitals. To date, 806 beds are in place and the remaining beds are to come on stream over the coming months. A further 450 acute beds/day places are in various stages of planning and development under the Capital Investment Framework 2005-2009. I launched an initiative which will provide up to 1,000 beds for public patients over the next five years. Tax reliefs provided under the Finance Act have been successful in attracting additional private capacity. The national treatment purchase fund has used capacity in the private hospital sector to treat some 35,000 public patients who have been waiting longest for admission to hospital.</P><Col N="1618"/>
        <P>On foot of my initiative to provide up to 1,000 beds for public patients over the next five years, I have asked my Department and the Health Service Executive to review public capacity requirements in the acute hospital sector in the light of developments since the health strategy and the progress of this initiative. My Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance regarding the provision of community based capacity for older people. Both Departments in recent times have discussed the possibility of providing 850 beds under a public private initiative and more recently have been looking at an option of providing additional capacity under a service level agreement.</P>
        <P>This would take the form of the Health Service Executive working closely with the private sector to provide the extra long-term beds for older people with a high to maximum dependency. The private providers would work to general admission and policy criteria set down by the executive over, for example, a five to seven year contract period. The present position is that the departmental discussions are proceeding around the service level agreement concept.</P>
        <P>Up to 90-95% of people&rsquo;s health care needs are capable of being met in the primary care setting and, to enable this to happen, it is necessary to continue to develop and enhance the range of services available in the community. I am committed to doing this in line with the principles set out in the strategy, &ldquo;Primary Care: A New Direction&rdquo;. Implementation of the strategy will require the development of new ways of working and the reorganisation of resources already in the system, both those in the statutory sector and those contracted to provide services, in line with the service model described in the strategy. It is in that context that additional resources can be deployed to best effect.</P>

	<P>I believe the Deputy is referring to the services which will be put in place as a result of the multi-annual investment programme announced as part of the national disability strategy, which includes the Disability Act 2005. The multi-annual investment programme is being introduced to support the development of high priority disability services over the period 2006-<Col N="1619"/>09. The cumulative additional spend over this period will total almost &euro;900 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Additional revenue funding of &euro;70 million and capital funding of &euro;60 million provided in 2005 for services for people with physical, sensory, intellectual disabilities, autism and mental illness is being used to put in place a broad range of new and enhanced services throughout the country. These include, among others, new residential, respite, day and home support services, together with enhanced access to child and adolescent mental health treatment services.</P>
        <P>As part of my Department&rsquo;s Estimates discussions with the Department of Finance, an increase in funding is being sought in 2006 to achieve the targets set out for residential, respite, day and other services and for other key supports required which were not provided for in the multi-annual investment programme. The locations and facilities in which these services will be provided are a matter for the Health Service Executive.</P>

The director of the National Children&rsquo;s Office, NCO, which is part of my Department, chairs the group. The terms of reference of the group are &ldquo;to recommend an integrated national policy on child care and early education which will result in improved co-ordination at national and local level and which incorporates a child centred approach to service delivery.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Members of the group initially comprised representatives from the Department of Education and Science, Department of Health and Children, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education. In April 2005, the high level working group prepared an interim report for the Cabinet committee.

        <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s office has liaised closely with the group and while not a formal member, it has participated in the deliberations of the group since then, attending the majority of meetings of the group. A second interim report was prepared for the Cabinet committee in July 2005. The Cabinet committee on children received an options paper from the group in early October and this is being considered at present.</P>

	<P>The HSE has advised that there were 22 home care teams throughout the country at the end of 2004 providing services to the ten former health board areas. The HSE has estimated that the total number of patients who accessed palliative care services provided by the home care teams was 7,203, with an estimated 95,000 home visits.</P><Col N="1622"/>
        <P>The HSE has advised that criteria for accessing palliative care services are based on the needs of the person with regard to their medical condition. However, a patient&rsquo;s medical condition may deteriorate to the extent that it may necessitate admission to hospital or specialist inpatient units for intensive medical and nursing care. In this regard, the HSE has advised that there are eight specialist palliative care inpatient units across the country and there are a number of inpatient units and satellite units at varying stages of operation and planning. There are in the region of 116 designated support beds available for patients needing palliative care in various community hospitals located throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The HSE has further advised that one of the key priorities for it and for voluntary agencies is the continued development of integrated specialist palliative care services. This includes progressing with the design, planning and development of further inpatient and satellite units, increased availability and scope of home care teams nationally and further development of day services and bed capacity at community hospitals.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware that in 2004 some 32,000 patients were readmitted to hospitals within one week of discharge. This figure is derived from the hospital in-patient enquiry, HIPE, system which gives details of activity in all publicly funded acute hospitals in the State. HIPE data only allow the identification of a readmission if it is to the same hospital as the original admission. The above figure includes all inpatient readmissions, that is, readmissions for the same condition, for an unrelated condition and planned readmissions, and excludes day cases. The figure of 32,000 represents just over 3% of the total number of patients discharged in 2004.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Methicillin-resistant staph aureus, MRSA, can exist without affecting people's health and information on the prevalence of such asymptomatic carriage is not routinely reported. For the purposes of the surveillance, prevention and control of this infection, however, the health protection surveillance centre collects data on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or &ldquo;blood poisoning&rdquo;, as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, EARRS. EARSS collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter. EARSS was designed to allow comparison of antimicrobial resistance data between countries and possibly regions but not between <Col N="1624"/>hospitals. In 2001, there was 337 reported cases of MRSA bloodstream infection, 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003 and 550 cases in 2004. The figure for the first six months of 2005 is 314 cases.</P>
        <P>I have already asked the Health Service Executive to develop systems and methodologies of reporting of MRSA infections by hospital so that we may have a fuller picture of the location and extent of these infections. It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors. The prevention and control of hospital acquired infections, HAIs, including MRSA, is a priority issue for the HSE. Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired infections, including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA.</P>
        <P>The HSE health protection surveillance centre has published guidelines on hand hygiene and guidelines on the control of MRSA for hospital and community settings. These significant documents give clear policy and practice guidance to health care workers on the control of hospital acquired infections, including MRSA. Good hand hygiene is one of the simplest and most effective measures that can be used to stop the spread of MRSA and other infections. Attitudes and practices need to change in health care environments to ensure that basic standards of hygiene apply.</P>
        <P>The national hygiene audit has been completed and I expect to receive a report shortly from the director of the national hospitals office. The results of the audit will form the basis for the changes that are required in both work environments and work practices so as to meet the highest possible standards of cleanliness in hospital settings. The results of the hygiene audit will be made public.</P>
        <P>The HSE will also publish national infection control standards and national cleaning standards &mdash; a consistent and robust set of hygiene standards for hospitals. Where previously standards may have depended on the approach of a particular hospital or health board, the HSE can now ensure every hospital will share and meet the same high standards of cleanliness and infection control. Measures to improve facilities and tackle overcrowding in hospitals are being taken as part of the capital investment framework which has and will continue to provide new and improved infrastructure in hospitals all around the country.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to engage with the HSE to agree on a series of actions over the next period of time so that MRSA can be effectively dealt with so as to see a reduction in the incidence and effects of these infections.</P>

Officials in my Department have written to the chairperson of the Mater Hospital ethics committee in regard to this matter and I will review the position when his reply is received.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use) Regulations 2004, S.I. 190 of 2004, govern the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 194 together.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in 2000 and currently covers the eastern, north-eastern, midland and part of the south-eastern regions of the country. There are approximately 160,000 in the target age group in these regions.</P>
        <P>The roll out of the national breast screening programme to the remaining regions in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services. A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for two new clinical units, one at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and one at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process, including the preparation of the tender documentation, will be completed by mid-2006. Approximately &euro;21 million capital funding has been made available and my Department is in discussions with BreastCheck about the revenue requirements for the programme.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions and it is expected that screening will commence in these regions in 2007. This will ensure that all women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P>
        <P>When the national roll out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing the screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age. There is no evidence of the value of population based breast screening programmes for women under 50 years of age and there are no plans to extend the programme to this age group. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>&ldquo;Reach Out&rdquo;&mdash; a national strategy for action on suicide prevention &mdash; was launched by the T&aacute;naiste on 8 September this year. This strategy builds on the work of the national task force on suicide, 1998, and takes account of the efforts and initiatives developed by the former health boards and the voluntary sector in recent years. In the course of the development of the strategy, wide ranging consultation took place throughout the country to draw on the experience, perspectives and ideas of the key stakeholders and interested parties. I believe that this consultation process, combined with continuous monitoring of evidence and best practice, has allowed for both an evidence based and pragmatic approach to be taken to effect real change over the next five to ten years.</P>
        <P>The strategy takes a combined public health and high risk approach to the issue of suicide prevention. Four levels of action comprise the main body of the report. These can be categorised as: a general population approach, a targeted approach, responding to suicide and information and research. At each level, action areas have been identified &mdash; 26 in total &mdash; and specific points of action have been identified to be implemented in three phases over the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Health Services Executive, HSE, will take a lead role in overseeing the implementation of the strategy, in partnership with statutory and voluntary organisations. Driving the implementation of the strategy will be a new national office for suicide prevention. The strategy is based on extensive consultation, sound evidence and international best practice. It is practical and achievable. It is evidence of this Government&rsquo;s determination to take whatever steps we can to reduce the level of suicide in our society and it will enable us to do that in a more comprehensive, co-ordinated and cohesive manner.</P>
        <P>In addition to existing funding, a further &euro;0.5 million has been allocated for the remainder of this year to commence the implementation of the national strategy for action on suicide prevention and funding for 2006 is currently under consideration in the context of the Estimates process. Additional funding allocations will be made available over the coming years to support the strategy and to complement local and national efforts.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in line with best international standards. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care to cancer patients. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in oncology services in the coming years. We will build on the substantial investment in cancer care since 1997 which has resulted in the funding of over 100 additional consultant posts in key areas of cancer care and over 327 cancer care nurses throughout the country.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, covers the eastern, north-eastern and midland regions of the country. The expansion of the programme to the south east has commenced and screening services are now available in counties Wexford and Carlow. The roll out to County Kilkenny will commence in 2006.</P>
        <P>The roll out of the programme to the remaining regions in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services. A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for the construction of two new BreastCheck clinical units, one at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. It is anticipated that, subject to obtaining satisfactory planning approval, the design process, including the preparation of the tender documentation, will be completed by mid-2006. Approximately &euro;21 million capital funding has been made available and my Department is in discussions with BreastCheck about the revenue requirements for the programme. There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions and BreastCheck is confident that the target date of April 2007 for the commencement of the roll out will be met.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the roll out of the national cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. Following the publication of the international expert&rsquo;s report on the feasibility and implications of a national roll out, my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. My Department will now discuss options for a national roll out of the programme with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the report, &ldquo;The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland&rdquo;. Recent developments in Cork and Galway have <Col N="1629"/>resulted in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators and the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Last July, I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Government considers that the best option in terms of improving geographic access for patients in the north-western area is to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North/South co-operation on cancer. I have already met the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, to discuss access by patients, mainly in the north west, to radiation oncology services at Belfast City Hospital. I will meet with him again shortly to further progress the Government&rsquo;s position on radiation oncology. Officials of my Department will also meet shortly with officials of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy. The strategy has been developed in consultation with major stakeholders, including professional and voluntary groups and the general public, and will have regard to the multi-faceted aspects of cancer control. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations on a balanced organisation of cancer services nationally, with defined roles for hospitals in the delivery of cancer care. I expect the national cancer forum to submit the new cancer strategy to me by the end of the year. On receipt, my Department will assess the policy implications, including costs, and I will then bring the new cancer strategy to Government.</P>

	<P>The report of the working group on elder abuse, &ldquo;Protecting Our Future&rdquo;, was launched on 11 November 2002. One of the recommendations in the elder abuse report is the establishment of a national implementation group, which was established in December 2003. Earlier this year the Department appointed a senior policy adviser and a secretary to assist the group in its work and, more recently, the Health Service Executive appointed a senior officer to assist the group with implementation issues.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to developing the services needed to tackle elder abuse and in 2003 provided funding of &euro;0.8 million to commence the implementation of the elder abuse programme. In 2004, an additional &euro;75,000 was allocated to each health board for its continued implementation of the programme and this year an additional &euro;0.9 million has been allocated for the elder abuse programme.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive advised that it has implemented a number of recommendations included in the elder abuse report. These include the establishment of steering groups in each former health board area to provide a common response to elder abuse throughout the State. Steering groups comprise representatives from the public sector, private organisations and voluntary organisations, including groups for older people. Steering groups are in the process of developing clear policies and guidelines for the protection of vulnerable adults following wide consultations with staff, and progress their work through subgroups on legal aspects, policy and procedures and training.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that a senior case worker be appointed to each former community <Col N="1631"/>care area and it is anticipated that the Health Service Executive will shortly recruit a senior case worker for each local health office area. Among the responsibilities of the senior case worker, in conjunction with the appropriate health service providers, will be the assessment of suspected cases of elder abuse referred to the local health office area.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has also advised that awareness training for Health Service Executive staff has been provided in line with paragraph 2.20 of the report and that it has been involved in awareness training with volunteer staff, including the national senior citizens helpline. The issue of elder abuse is being incorporated into professional training courses, including gerontology courses. A number of research projects have been undertaken, including the examination and review of medication in older persons in continuing care settings.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 162, 180, 268, 300, 309 and 348 together.</P>
        <P>I wish to take this opportunity to clarify that avian influenza, &ldquo;bird flu&rdquo;, is an infectious disease of birds caused by the type A strains of the influenza virus. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian influ<Col N="1633"/>enza in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has a contingency plan for avian influenza and all questions relating to this should be referred to my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of outbreaks in poultry in Asia since late 2003. Countries currently affected are Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and the Russian Federation east of the Ural Mountains. Turkey and Romania have now been added to this list. According to the World Health Organisation, the spread of the A/H5N1 virus to poultry in new areas is of concern as it increases opportunities for further human cases to occur. However, all evidence to date indicates that the H5N1 virus does not spread easily from birds to infect humans. The WHO level of pandemic alert remains unchanged at phase 3: a virus new to humans is causing infections, but does not spread easily from one person to another.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Health Service Executive are closely monitoring avian influenza developments with particular reference to the public health implications. Information on avian influenza is available on the health protection surveillance centre website under the health topics section and a factsheet for travellers forms part of this information. There are no special travel restrictions, immunisations or precautions to countries affected by avian influenza, A/H5N1, because of the presence of that virus. Standard precautions for travellers are: to avoid contact with live poultry and wild birds; to avoid visiting live animal markets and poultry farms; to avoid contact with surfaces contaminated with animal faeces; to avoid handling birds found dead; not to eat or handle undercooked or raw poultry, egg or duck dishes; exercise good personal hygiene with frequent hand washing; do not attempt to bring any live poultry products back to Europe.</P>
        <P>The health protection surveillance centre posted the following documents on its website, <i>www.hpsc.ie</i>, on 14 October: Interim guidance for protection of persons involved in Avian Influenza outbreak control and eradication activities in Ireland; Interim guidance on public health actions to be taken on notification of Avian Influenza in animals in Ireland; Avian Influenza Case Surveillance Form. A sub-group of the influenza pandemic expert group had been working on this guidance material. It was published on Friday last due to the increased concern following confirmation of H5N1 infection in Turkey.</P>
        <P>In addition, interim Irish guidelines on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza &mdash; influenza A/H5 &mdash; have been circulated to all health care professionals and are also posted on the HPSC website. A clinical management algorithm has been circulated to hospitals and clinicians on the <Col N="1634"/>appropriate management of travellers returning from countries affected by avian influenza presenting with fever and respiratory symptoms. This will assist in early detection of any influenza A/H5 cases.</P>
        <P>Three times in the last century, the influenza A viruses have undergone major genetic changes, resulting in global pandemics and large tolls in terms of both disease and deaths. The most infamous pandemic was &ldquo;Spanish Flu&rdquo; which affected large parts of the world population and is thought to have killed at least 40 million people in 1918-1919. More recently, two other influenza A pandemics occurred in 1957, Asian influenza, and 1968, Hong Kong influenza, and caused significant morbidity and mortality globally.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects. My Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. A detailed plan for response to an influenza pandemic was prepared in 2004. This plan is currently being updated to reflect the most up to date advice of the influenza pandemic expert group and the World Health Organisation, WHO. This work has continued over the summer.</P>
        <P>Vaccination will be the primary public health intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. Developments are taking place at international level seeking to expedite the pandemic vaccine production process. A vaccine is in development which could offer some protection against an H5N1 flu strain. International experts consider that a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine could be used as a first line of defence for priority groups while a vaccine against the exact pandemic influenza strain is manufactured. It was decided in August on foot of expert advice that a limited amount of H5N1 vaccine should be purchased. It is intended to purchase 400,000 doses, sufficient for 200,000 people. The Department of Health and Children is actively pursuing this matter. H5N1 vaccines will not be available anywhere before March/April 2006.</P>
        <P>Antivirals can shorten the duration of the disease and alleviate symptoms. We already have an emergency supply of over 45,000 treatment packs of antivirals, Tamiflu&reg;, and 10,000 units of paediatric suspension. We are stockpiling a further 1 million treatment packs of Tamiflu&reg;. This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population. A total of 600,000 packs will be delivered by the end of this year. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered next year. Plans for the storage and distribution of antivirals are being developed as part of the planning process. The size of the stockpile is in line with international trends, for example, the UK is also building up a stockpile <Col N="1635"/>to cover 25% of its population. Its stockpile will be complete by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>I am aware of reports regarding research which is to be published later this week regarding the possibility that the use of Tamiflu&reg; may have contributed to the emergence of partial resistance to the drug in a Vietnamese patient. This interesting study will be considered by the expert group in the course of its ongoing work. However, it was already known that the potential for drug resistance exists and the situation is being monitored. Tamiflu&reg; remains the internationally agreed antiviral of choice in the context of a pandemic.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that pandemic planning is a dynamic process. This means that the strategy for use of antivirals must be kept under review. In particular, the expert group will need to review the epidemiological data before final recommendations are decided in the setting of an imminent pandemic. The decision making process will be guided at all times by relevant expert advice from the European Commission and the World Health Organisation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 174, 187 and 328, together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is advancing the implementation of a series of measures to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services. These measures take a wide ranging approach and are aimed at improving access to accident and emergency services, improving patient flows through accident and emergency departments, freeing up of acute beds and providing appropriate longer term care for patients outside of the acute hospital setting.</P>
        <P>A particular focus has been placed on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed <Col N="1637"/>their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The HSE is making sustained efforts to arrange for the discharge of these patients in order to have more acute beds available in hospital for emergency patients. The number of delayed discharges in the major Dublin hospitals now stands at 378. This is the lowest number since January 2005 and has been achieved as a result of the various measures being implemented to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>
        <P>The following is the current position regarding the implementation of these measures. In the care of the elderly area, 48 high dependency beds have been contracted in private nursing homes for those patients with more demanding care needs. A total of 318 patients have been discharged to 95 intermediate care beds for six to eight week stays since contracts with private providers commenced in May. Seventy long-term patients in St. Mary&rsquo;s in the Phoenix Park are being identified in consultation with clinicians and families for transfer to private nursing homes. These beds will allow for the discharge of 35 patients each from the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals. A further 65 patients have been transferred to private nursing homes pending the re-opening of 65 public long-stay beds which were closed in nursing facilities on the southside of Dublin. Additional homecare packages and enhanced subventions have facilitated the discharge of 246 and 94 patients respectively in the Dublin area. It is recognised that a range of short-term, medium-term and long-term measures are needed which transcend the immediate operational issues in accident and emergency departments and which are integrally linked to the development of primary care services and support services for the elderly. My Department and the Health Service Executive will continue to work closely to maintain a focus on the implementation of system-wide measures to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Following a review of all inquiries by the Attorney General during mid-2004, the Government decided in September 2004 that the Dunne post mortem inquiry should submit its report on or before 31 March 2005, on which date the inquiry would cease to exist. The chairman, Ms Anne Dunne SC, submitted her report on the due date. However, following consultation with the Attorney General, I was advised that for legal reasons the report could not be published. On 3 May 2005 the Government approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden BL, to complete a final report on post mortem practice and procedure. I expect Dr. Madden to present her report on 21 December 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In late 1999, my Department wrote to all health boards and hospitals requesting that they ensure that a policy of informed consent should operate in regard to the retention of organs following post mortem examination, pending the issue of guidelines by the faculty of pathology. These guidelines for post mortem consent and retention of tissues at post mortem examination were issued by the faculty in February 2000.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has confirmed that guidelines and protocols are in place for families in regard to both coroners&rsquo; and non-coroners&rsquo; post mortems. In accordance with these guidelines, families are to be informed when retention takes place in a coroner&rsquo;s post mortem and permission is to be sought to retention in the case of a non-coroner&rsquo;s post mortem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">European Directive 2004/23/EC requires member states to endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells for human applications. The directive, which must be transposed into national law by 7 April 2006, will also make informed consent mandatory.</P>

	<P>The most recent report from the <Col N="1640"/>National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994-2002, estimates the annual incidence of prostate cancer to have increased by 5% over the period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A new national cancer strategy is currently being finalised by the national cancer forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts in oncology. As part of this work, the forum has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The forum has also developed criteria against which all future screening programmes will be assessed.</P>
        <P>In regard to screening for prostate cancer, I understand that the forum will decide that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme. This issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised control trials currently being conducted internationally.</P>
        <P>This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country. Any man who has concerns about prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</P>

At present, inpatient services for children and adolescents are provided at Warrenstown House, Dublin and at St. Anne&rsquo;s in Galway.</P>
        <P>The working group on child and adolescent psychiatry also recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric services as the most effective means of providing the required service for children with mental illness. This has been a priority for my Department in recent years. Since 1997, additional funding in excess of &euro;20 million has been provided to allow for the appointment of additional consultants in child and adolescent psychiatry, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. This has resulted in the funding of a further 23 child and adolescent consultant psychiatrists. Nationally, there are now 56 such psychiatrists employed.</P>
        <P>Under the new Disability Act, the definition of disability is based on the degree of disability and not on the type of illness. This means that all severe and enduring, or chronic, mental illnesses would be covered. It is most likely, therefore, that the severity of the eating disorder and the patient&rsquo;s prognosis would determine eligibility for services under the Act.</P>
        <P>The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including services for eating disorders and child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the expert group on mental health policy which is due to complete its work before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, was established as one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists arising from the health strategy. It is used for the purpose of treating public patients who have been waiting longest for surgery. Up to the end of September over 35,000 patients have had treatment arranged for them by the NTPF.</P>
        <P>The management of outpatient waiting lists is, in the first instance, a matter for the National Hospitals Office and the individual hospitals concerned. However, earlier this year I asked the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, to examine the position with a view to further assessing the needs of patients waiting longest on outpatient waiting lists and the most appropriate clinical pathways and protocols required for their care.</P>
        <P>As a result the NTPF set up a number of pilot projects around the country. The intention is that the longest waiters in a number of specialties will receive consultations at outpatient level in private hospitals. It is envisaged that between 4,000 to 5,000 patients will have outpatient appointments arranged for them. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements will be put in place by the NTPF in order to assess the outcome of the outpatient pilot projects. I understand that the pilot projects are under way and I expect to receive a report from the NTPF in due course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">My Department has for some time had concerns in regard to the advertising and marketing of alcohol products, in particular with regard to young people. These concerns relate specifically to the content and placement of alcohol advertising. One of the recommendations contained in the interim report of the strategic task force on alcohol, STFA, was to reduce the exposure of young people to <Col N="1645"/>alcohol advertisements. In pursuance of this recommendation the heads of a Bill were drafted to restrict alcohol advertising.</P>
        <P>In parallel with this process, representatives of the advertising, communications, drinks and media sectors were informed of the Department&rsquo;s concerns and of the proposal to introduce the legislation. The industry representatives acknowledged the Department&rsquo;s concerns and sought time to respond on an incremental basis.</P>
        <P>Following the industry&rsquo;s response a code of practice has now been agreed which will significantly reduce the exposure of alcohol advertising generally but particularly to young people which was the purpose of the task force recommendation. An independently chaired monitoring body is to be established to oversee the operation of the code. Consequently, it has been decided to delay the introduction of the Bill for the moment pending the implementation and evaluation of the code.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those who were charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 <Col N="1648"/>will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years prior to that date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index, since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion and at this stage it is envisaged that it will run until December 2007. Figures provided by the Health Service Executive show an estimated 60,000 people are likely to be due a repayment. Approximately 20,000 of these are living and 40,000 relate to estates of deceased patients.</P>
        <P>Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme. In the case of those who were charged and are still alive, the repayments will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.</P>
        <P>The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services.</P>
        <P>A national oversight committee has been appointed and has already begun its work. It will provide independent input into the design of the scheme and will monitor the operation of the scheme to ensure it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the <i>ex gratia</i> payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>
        <P>An outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to design and manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The company selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the necessary co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. The HSE has received expressions of interest from a number of companies and these have been short-listed. It is anticipated that the successful company will be selected in November and will begin work on the <Col N="1649"/>design of the scheme. The selection of this company will provide independent input into the design and administration of the scheme.</P>
        <P>The national helpline set up by the HSE to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme.</P>

        <P>My Department is further advised that the executive is in regular contact with the chairperson of the SOS group, and that she has expressed satisfaction with the progress made to date. It is evident from the foregoing that considerable progress has been made in putting in place a comprehensive range of support services for patients who have undergone symphysiotomy.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding genetically modified, GM, foods. It carries out checks of the marketplace for compliance with the GM legislation. Under the EU GM food and feed regulation, only authorised GM foods, or foods containing ingredients thereof, can be placed on the market. New legislation, which came into force in 2004, stipulates that persons wishing to place GM foods on the market must provide material and information to enable testing for specific GM organisms, GMOs, before they may be authorised for marketing. The GM labelling threshold provided for in the regulation requires that a food or ingredient be labelled if it has a GM content of more than 0.9%. This labelling threshold is intended to cater for adventitious contamination that may occur as a result of mixing during production, processing, storage or transport.</P>
        <P>The FSAI has carried out a number of surveys of the food supply chain in recent years and has employed both the State Laboratory as well as a private laboratory to carry out testing of the genetic material &mdash; DNA &mdash; in a range of foods using a technique called polymerase chain reaction, PCR. One of the uses of this highly sensitive technique is to allow for the testing for the presence, and sometimes the amount, of a GMO present in a food. The EU Joint Research Centre, based in Ispra in Italy, has undertaken to standardise how GMOs and derived food and feed are tested using PCR, and a number of tests have already been developed.</P>
        <P>The FSAI&rsquo;s recently published report concentrated on its surveillance of foods carrying GM-free labels as this type of label had been identified as a potential problem in previous surveys. Terms such as &ldquo;non-GM&rdquo; and &ldquo;GM-free&rdquo; are not defined by EU or national legislation and thus are subject to the general food labelling directive which stipulates that labels should not mislead the purchaser. Therefore, a food labelled to indicate that no GM ingredients are present may not contain any level of GM ingredients.</P>
        <P>The results show that a small number of products with GM-free labels contained low levels of GM ingredients. In addition, a number of foods with GM-free labels had no ingredients that could be from a GM source meaning that such labels in <Col N="1653"/>those cases were merely a marketing tool rather than for consumer information. The FSAI is following up on this matter with the companies concerned. The FSAI has requested that retailers remove all batches of foods carrying GM free type labels identified in survey as containing GM ingredients.</P>
        <P>In the best interests of the consumer, food business operators are warned that the FSAI will continue to test foods with GM-free-type labels and that legal proceedings will be considered where products bearing GM-free-type labels are found to contain any level of GM ingredients.</P>

	<P>Since the launch of &ldquo;Building Healthier Hearts&rdquo; in 1999, approximately &euro;60 million has been invested by the Government towards the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy. This has resulted in substantial improvements in treatment and detection of heart disease both nationally and in western counties.</P>
        <P>In the HSE western area two additional consultant cardiologist posts have been funded through the cardiovascular health strategy as well as the necessary infrastructure and facilities required to support these appointments. A chest pain clinic in University College Hospital, Galway, UCHG, has also been funded as has the employment of supporting staff providing a structured link between the primary care and hospital settings and the rapid diagnosis of angina, enabling further diagnostic tests and treatment as <Col N="1654"/>appropriate. Cardiac rehabilitation is now available in UCHG and Mayo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>As a result of the investment through the cardiovascular health strategy there has been a considerable increase in the number of certain coronary procedures in the HSE western area. For example, the figures for coronary arteriography in 1996 were 3.7 per 10,000 population compared with a national average of 16.5. The corresponding figure for 2004 was 26.5, compared to a national average of 25.7. There have been similar increases in other cardiac interventions.</P>

	<P>The HSE has advised that it is aware of the different practices around the country in the past in relation to the inspection of residential homes for older people and is committed to implementing a coordinated standardised approach. The HSE has further advised that it has agreed a national standardised inspection process, to include unannounced inspections, which will be implemented by all inspection teams throughout the country by the end of October 2005.</P>
        <P>Moving forward, it is the intention of my Department to put in place a more robust regulatory system as quickly as possible to protect vulnerable older people in long-stay facilities. The process has begun to review the current system with a view to strengthening the powers available to those involved in inspecting facilities and to extend a strengthened inspection system to public facilities. It is intended that the Health Bill 2005 will establish both the HIQA and the SSI on a statutory basis and will contain provisions to underpin a more robust inspectorial system.</P>

        <P>The information sought by the Deputy about the proportion of the training budget spent and details of courses funded by the Department of the Taoiseach in the last three years is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of the Taoiseach continues to work towards the target of 4% of payroll being spent on training and development as committed to in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and Sustaining Progress. The Department of the Taoiseach is committed to ensuring that every member of staff has the opportunity to develop the competencies required to meet work objectives, thus contributing to meeting the Department&rsquo;s goals and objectives, now and in the future, and to further personal and career development goals at each stage of the work life cycle from induction to retirement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In compliance with circular 21-78, third level courses of education, all courses funded in the Department of the Taoiseach are accepted as relevant to employment in the Civil Service generally. To be eligible for a refund of course fees, each person is required to sign a necessary form of undertaking. Therefore, he or she is committed to reimbursing, in full, to the Department of the Taoiseach, the amount paid in respect of their academic studies if he or she discontinues the course or if he or she leaves the Civil Service without having worked a period equal to the duration of the course following its completion.</P><Col N="1661"/>

	<P>The Shape of the Nations survey was commissioned by Sanofi-Aventis, a pharmaceutical company and was conducted in 27 countries, excluding Ireland, during July 2005. The survey was carried out among the general public, people identified as at risk for heart disease, and primary care physicians, to assess knowledge and understanding of the increased risk of heart disease posed by excess abdominal fat.</P>
        <P>The survey concluded that six out of ten physicians recognise abdominal fat as a significant risk factor for heart disease. However, only a minority of the public is aware of the waist size that puts them at risk for heart disease and fewer than one in five people can expect to have their waist circumference measured by their doctor.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The heart health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts 1999, acknowledged that fat deposits in the abdominal area were a better predictor of coronary artery disease than the degree of obesity. According to the 2004 report of the national task force on obesity, Obesity: the Policy Chal<Col N="1665"/>lenges, obese individuals with excess fat deposited around the abdomen are more likely to develop health problems. The report made a number of recommendations in relation to the measurement of waist circumference, for example, that it be part of routine clinical health care practice and that this information be included in a national database of growth measurements.</P>
        <P>An implementation strategy for the report is being developed by the Department of Health and Children in order to progress implementation of the recommendations.</P>

	<P>Prior to the establishment of the Health Service Executive, HSE, parliamentary questions concerning access to services by individuals or in specific geographic areas, were referred to the chief executive officer of the relevant health board for direct reply.</P>
        <P>Pursuant to the Health Act 2004, the functions of the health boards were transferred to the HSE. Under the Act, the HSE has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. <Col N="1666"/>Consequently, operational questions fall within the statutory responsibility of the HSE.</P>
        <P>In addition, the establishment of the HSE brought into being a new unitary system for the delivery and management of health services. Under the 2004 Act, the HSE has its own Vote. Accordingly, it is also responsible for service delivery and management questions of a national dimension, including the establishment of service priorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Health Act 2004 contains significant provisions dealing with the accountability of the HSE. These include specific provision for attendance by its chief executive officer before Oireachtas committees to give an account of the general administration of the executive. The chief executive officer is also accountable to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as the accounting officer in regard to the appropriation accounts of the executive. Part 7 of the Act provides for the corporate plan, annual service plan, annual report and accounts, prepared by the executive, to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As Minister, I am responsible for the legislative and regulatory framework underpinning the delivery of health and personal social services, national policy issues including overall service, human resources and industrial relations, workforce planning, resource allocation, performance management and health service reform issues, and issues relating to my own Department.</P>

Two grant schemes were put in place in 2004 as a direct result of the publi<Col N="1671"/>cation of the policy to provide for increased play provision for children, as follows. The local authority playground grants scheme, launched in 2004, was jointly administered by the National Children&rsquo;s Office, NCO, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and provided up to 50% funding for the development of new, or renovation of existing, playgrounds. A total of just over &euro;2 million was allocated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the county and city councils under the scheme. The 32 new or refurbished playgrounds being developed under this scheme represent a total investment of approximately &euro;4,200,000 and the locations are set out in Appendix 1.</P>

Each local authority was allocated a grant of &euro;60,000 to meet the cost of purchase and delivery of playground equipment which could be spent on one or more facilities. The total expenditure under this scheme in 2005 is &euro;2,040,000 and the locations are set out in Appendix 2.</P>
        <P>The RAPID playground grants scheme was also launched in 2004. Funding of &euro;3 million &mdash;&euro;1.5 million from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and &euro;1.5 million from the Department of Health and Children &mdash; was provided to support the development of new or refurbishment of existing playgrounds in RAPID areas. Each Strand I RAPID area received a total allocation of &euro;72,000 and each Strand II RAPID area received a total allocation <Col N="1672"/>of &euro;60,000. The local authority in consultation with the relevant area implementation team selected the projects to be supported. A total of 22 playgrounds have been built, to date, in some of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, at the locations set out in Appendix 3. This scheme was also continued in 2005 with RAPID areas again receiving grants totalling &euro;3 million.</P>
        <P>It was a condition of both schemes outlined above, drawn up in consultation with the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, that insurance and maintenance costs of playgrounds built under the scheme would be met by the local authority.</P>
        <P>While playgrounds are usually aimed at pre-school and primary school children, some of the playgrounds funded under the schemes were for older children, particularly in the large Dublin areas. The most recent figures available to the NCO suggest that a total of 43 playgrounds have been completed and are now open to the public since the publication of the play policy. It should be noted that in recent years, many local authorities have been putting additional investment into play facilities over and above the matching funding required in the scheme outlined above, thus further increasing the numbers of playgrounds.</P>
        <P>While the NCO, which is fully funded by my Department, has an overall role in supporting implementation of the national play policy, individual Departments retain responsibility for implementation of actions falling within their remit. In the context of playgrounds, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has lead responsibility in relation to the provision of playgrounds. </P><Col N="1671"/>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if it is Government policy for the value of a person&rsquo;s residence to be taken into account when decisions are being taken regarding levels of subvention or enhanced subvention to be paid in respect of nursing home assistance for persons with Alzheimer&rsquo;s or dementia; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of private nursing home care based on a dependency and means assessment. The criteria used in determining a person&rsquo;s eligibility for subvention are set out in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. The subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care. It should be noted that the regulations governing means assessment were devised to try to provide an equitable system of payment and to direct available resources to those most in need. These regulations apply to all applicants for a subvention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Second Schedule to the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 sets out the general rules for the assessment of means in respect of an application for a nursing home subvention. &ldquo;Means&rdquo; for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Article 13 of the Second Schedule to the regulations states that the Health Service Executive &ldquo;may impute an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence of the person, if it was not occupied immediately prior to or at the time of the application by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pernsion, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Article 22 of the Second Schedule provides that the executive may refuse to pay a subvention to a person if his or her principal residence is valued at £75,000, &euro;95,230, or more and is not occupied <Col N="1680"/>by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 years or in full time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension and the person&rsquo;s income is greater than &euro;6,350 per annum.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently reviewing the subvention scheme and the current thresholds set out in the regulations will be examined as part of that review.</P>

	<P>Further to the meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Russian Foreign Minister in July 2005 at which it was decided to follow up at official level the question of pursuing a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Russia on intercountry adoption, the Adoption Board has been in ongoing contact with the Irish Embassy in Moscow. Ambassador Harman met with the director of the department of governmental youth policy, upbringing and social welfare of children on 21 September 2005 to further discuss the matter and follow up action is being taken on foot of that meeting. It is important to note, however, that it is not possible at this stage to confirm either a timeframe for the completion of the negotiations or whether or not such negotiations will result in a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>Legislation to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993 was prepared by my Department and forwarded to the parliamentary counsel for drafting. It is hoped the Bill will be published in early 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that I share his concerns regarding the use of sunbeds. I am advised by the medical staff in my Department that ultraviolet light, either through natural exposure or sunbed exposure increases the risk of developing skin cancer, particularly melanoma. The use of sunbeds leads to damage from ultraviolet radiation in the same way as sunlight exposure. Exposure in childhood is associated with even greater risks of subsequent melanoma.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am aware that the national cancer forum has been considering measures to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the context of the development of the new national cancer strategy. <Col N="1682"/>I expect that the forum will consider it necessary to complement current efforts to promote safe sun practices and to reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation with the regulation and restriction of the use of sunbeds to use by adults only. The forum is currently finalising the strategy and I expect it to be completed by the end of the year. I will then bring the document to Government and publish it as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
        <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works in partnership with the Irish Cancer Society to develop health promotion programmes with communities and workplaces and to undertake regular public information and awareness campaigns that focus on cancer prevention, risk prevention and early detection. A consumer information sheet on possible risks from sunbeds and sunlamps and the appropriate precautions is available from the Irish Cancer Society. A &ldquo;Sunsmart&rdquo; campaign is organised each year by the society to increase awareness of risk factors for skin cancer. With regard to sunbeds the society advises that they are not a safe way to tan. In particular, the society advises that people should not use sunbeds if they have skin which always sunburns with no ability to tan or sunburns quite easily with only an ability to develop a light tan; are less than 18 years of age; have large numbers of moles; tend to freckle; have a history of frequent childhood sunburn; have pre-malignant or malignant skin lesions; have sun damaged skin; are wearing cosmetics, which may increase sensitivity to UV exposure; or are taking medication. In this case persons should seek advice from their doctor to determine if the medication will make them UV radiation sensitive. This advice is in line with the World Health Organisation recommendations for the management of sunbed operations which incorporate the recommendations of the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>if the potential to change the system through which orthodontic services are delivered will be investigated; and the need to respond to those requiring these critical services.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In recent years there have been several reviews of the orthodontic service. Formed at the invitation of the Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic service and produced a report in 1998 entitled the Moran report. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of ortho<Col N="1683"/>dontic treatment throughout the health boards. Furthermore, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, OJCHC, also carried out a review of orthodontic services which culminated in the publication of its report, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland, in 2002. This was followed by a further review by the health board chief executive officers of the orthodontic service to consider the OJCHC&rsquo;s report and assess progress with implementing the Moran report. The OJCHC has also published a follow up to its 2002 report on the orthodontic service in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a number of measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the orthodontic service. My Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, have funded 22 dentists from various HSE areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. The most recent group of 13 trainees have now completed their training and have taken up posts in the HSE since 1 October 2005. This means that almost half the orthodontists in Ireland are now working in the public health service.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that, at the end of the June 2005 quarter, there were 23,216 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many patients getting orthodontic treatment as there are waiting to be treated and more than 7,000 extra patients are getting treatment from the HSE since the end of the June 2001 quarter. The improvement in quality of treatment and numbers being treated is directly attributable to the steps that have already been taken and will continue to be taken to ensure ongoing improvements to the service. The addition of 13 specialists in orthodontics to the service since 1 October 2005 will have a further significant impact on numbers in treatment and waiting lists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department has met the HSE regarding the latest Oireachtas joint committee report. Since that meeting the HSE, in order to ensure ongoing training, has committed funding for the training of a further four orthodontists. My Department, in conjunction with the HSE, is considering each of the recommendations set out in the report of the Oireachtas joint committee.</P>

        <P>In response to this action a working group was established comprising statutory and non-statutory representation. The group undertook a number of initiatives including a review of services within the former ERHA and of service gaps nationally. The group&rsquo;s report sets out a framework for the delivery of drug treatment services for under 18 year olds.</P>

	<P>I intend to bring a motion before the Oireachtas shortly seeking approval for the ratification by Ireland of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The convention is an initiative of the World Health <Col N="1688"/>Organisation in response to the global epidemic of tobacco addiction. The treaty, which was adopted unanimously by the World Health Assembly in May 2003 and signed by Ireland in September 2003, provides an agreed approach to tobacco control at a global level. This will be the first binding international treaty that addresses all aspects of tobacco control &mdash; the traditional health interventions such as advertising and sponsorship bans; passive smoking; and retail licensing. It also addresses economic and trade issues including taxation policy, international trade and smuggling. Other areas include product specification and issues of compensation and liability.</P>
        <P>Ireland is a strong advocate of effective tobacco control policies and of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and has consistently pressed these policies nationally and internationally in order to protect public health and reduce deaths from tobacco related illness. To enable the treaty to come into force, ratification by 40 states is necessary and this figure was achieved at the end of last year. Ireland is committed to effective tobacco control policies. Our smoke-free workplace initiative which commenced in March 2004 has drawn favourable comment from public health authorities around the world as an effective public health instrument in tackling the negative health effects of tobacco smoking. A number of other jurisdictions are using the Irish experience as a basis for similar health interventions.</P>

	<P>Equal access for equal need is a core value for the delivery of publicly funded services including access in terms of timing and geographic location and is a key principle of the national health strategy. The establishment of the Health Service Executive, arising from the rationalisation of the health boards and other health service agencies under the health service reform programme, has reduced fragmentation in the health system and is aimed at achieving consistency in service delivery across the country.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.

This includes responsibility for the provision of therapies. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief officer of the HSE to reply directly regarding the issue of staffing levels.</P>

	<P>In April 2000, the South Eastern Health Board sought tenders for a suite of hospital information systems on behalf of five health boards and selected hospitals within the Eastern Regional Health Authority. With the creation of HeBE, the proposal became a national one and was handled by HeBE in terms of a national approach. HeBE approached the Department for funding in the context of the national health information strategy and indicated that they wished to place the contract with iSoft on behalf of the health service. The business case for taking that particular supplier was made as a result of a consultancy study carried out by Deloitte &amp; Touche in October 2003.</P>
        <P>In late 2003 HeBE had been pressing the Department for an approval to sign the contract and a submission was made to the Minister setting out the case for a hospital information system. The Secretary General raised issues concerning the operational support of the system and indicated that time should be allowed to ensure <Col N="1700"/>that a correct decision was made. The Minister raised issues regarding tendering requirements, suitability for major hospitals and the approval that would be required from the Department of Finance. The Minister decided to await a report on these issues before making any decisions on the project.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the interim Health Service Executive sought independent advice on the system and the Health Service Executive sought approval for the system early in 2005. Department of Finance approval of 2005, which was essentially for the replacement of two old health board sites and approval for national rollout was subject to a number of stringent conditions. There has to be further agreement from the Department of Finance before the project as originally submitted can begin.</P>

Successive Ministers have been involved in agreeing the overall capital requirement for ICT, which was also examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and approved by the D&aacute;il. In particular, the health service capital programme which includes PPARS was discussed at the Department&rsquo;s MAC meetings attended by Ministers during 2003 and 2004. It is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s practice not to attend MAC meetings of her Department but officials have on occasion discussed the capital programme with the T&aacute;naiste.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. However, full details of the scheme have yet to be finalised. The Health Service Executive has informed my Department that an outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged by it in November to provide an independent input into the design and administration of the scheme. It is my intention to have legislation brought before the Oireachtas during the next parliamentary session and to commence repayments shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>A national helpline has been set up by the Health Service Executive to allow people to register if they believe they or a family member may be due a repayment. More than 18,000 applications have been registered with the executive to date. This helpline will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact again to register for the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that the total number of nurses overpaid under PPARS is 258, in a total of 49 hospitals. To put this in context, I advise the Deputy that for the three HSE regions concerned &mdash; the midland, mid-western and north-western regions but excluding St. James&rsquo;s Hospital &mdash; there are 9,568 nurses on the payroll, almost 190,000 payments have been made through PPARS, and 130 nurses were overpaid in these areas. The HSE is satisfied that the overpayments in the main have resulted from incorrect entry of data on the system or the late input of data, rather than from flaws in the configuration of the PPARS system. In interpreting this figure, the Deputy should note that, unlike the old systems, PPARS deems even a single cent over to be an overpayment and hence the numbers of overpayments can appear much greater in comparison to the old systems.</P>
        <P>I am advised that an upgrade of the system has occurred on the weekend of 2 October 2005, which will result in staff being more accurately paid, and a further 651 nurses will be impacted. The net value of these payments is very small, as a number of employees had also been underpaid. This upgrade will result in more accurate payments for allowances and deductions for part-periods, which were not dealt with automatically under the old manual payroll systems.</P>

	<P>Each agency had its specific procedure for recoupments except for recoupments identified as part of the upgrade in September 2005 where a national agreement was made. Prior to the upgrade in September 2005 there was no national agreement in place for overpayments. The following was agreed nationally and communicated to trade unions at national and local level, namely, that for recoupment values less than &euro;15, employees were notified in advance through internal notification &mdash; notices on notice boards, internal e-mail and through line managers. The recoupment value is listed on <Col N="1706"/>employees&rsquo; October 2005 payslips as advance notice. The recoupments will be deducted from employees in November 2005. For recoupment values greater than &euro;15, a separate letter is being issued to the individual employees advising them of the arrangements. The recoupment value is listed on employees&rsquo; October 2005 payslips as advance notice. Employees are being contacted during October 2005 to agree a repayment process. Repayments can be made over a number of pay periods and this is based on the amount due.</P>
        <P>Prior to the upgrade in September 2005 there was no national agreement in place for overpayments, and the following agency agreements were operated. The process for recovery of overpayments in the north-western area is as follows: identification of overpayment is made; the recoupment is agreed with the employee; for smaller amounts recoupment is made in the next available pay cycle; and for larger amounts the period is agreed with the employee and, as a rule of thumb, should be less than one year. The amount may extend beyond one year on occasions if the amount involved is large.</P>

        <Quest>the state of the inquiry conducted by Dr. Deirdre Madden, BL, into post mortem practice and procedure, especially in relation to children; the reason the abandoned Dunne report could not be published in its then state; the further reason it merely reported on three hospitals out of approximately 200; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following a review of all inquiries by the Attorney General during mid-2004, the Government decided in September 2004 that the Dunne post mortem inquiry should submit its report on or before 31 March 2005, on which date the inquiry would cease to exist. The chairman, Ms Anne Dunne, SC, submitted her report on the due date. However, following consultation with the Attorney General, I was advised that for legal reasons the report could not be published. On 3 May 2005 the Government approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden, BL, to complete a final report on post mortem practice and procedure. I expect Dr. Madden to present her report on 21 December 2005.</P>
        <P>In late 1999, my Department wrote to all health boards and hospitals requesting that they ensure that a policy of informed consent should operate in respect of the retention of organs following post mortem examination, pending the issue of guidelines by the faculty of pathology. These guidelines for post mortem consent and retention of tissues at post mortem examination were issued by the faculty in February 2000.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has confirmed that guidelines and protocols are in place for <Col N="1709"/>families in relation to both coroners&rsquo; and non-coroners&rsquo; post mortems. In accordance with these guidelines, families are to be informed when retention takes place in a coroner&rsquo;s post mortem and permission is to be sought to retention in the case of a non-coroner&rsquo;s post mortem.</P>
        <P>European Directive 2004/23/EC requires member states to endeavour to ensure voluntary and unpaid donation of tissues and cells for human applications. The directive, which must be transposed into national law by 7 April 2006, will also make informed consent mandatory.</P>

	<P>Payments made by my Department to the firm in question during the period 2000 to date relate solely to work undertaken by it in respect of the civil registration modernisation programme. The work undertaken relates primarily to the development of and support for the information technology system required to support the modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme was a programme of work undertaken jointly by my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. One of the main elements of the programme was the development of an information technology system for electronic registration of life events and sharing of registration data. The programme was overseen by a steering committee with representatives from a number of Departments and agencies and was managed by a programme management group which reported to the steering committee. The procurement exercise for the appointment of consultants to develop the computer system was undertaken by the Department of Social and <Col N="1716"/>Family Affairs. I understand that the procurement exercise was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance requirements. Moneys in respect of this contract were paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the firm in question during 2001 and 2002 and my Department, as the ultimate owner of the new system, took over responsibility for payments in respect of the contract in 2003. The total amount paid by my Department in 2003 was &euro;1,271,662.40.</P>
        <P>The civil registration information technology system went live in the former southern health board region in late 2003 and was subsequently rolled out to all other former health boards during 2004. The system has brought considerable benefits to members of the public and other Departments and public bodies. The registration of life events and production of certificates is now electronic and the time taken to complete these transactions has been significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>Data is passed electronically from the General Register Office, GRO, to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for the purpose of processing claims and payments for child benefit. The processing time for child benefit applications has been reduced from 20 days to two days as a result. This process is further enhanced by the transfer of births data electronically from maternity hospitals to GRO and the electronic allocation of PPS numbers in respect of newly registered births.</P>
        <P>Deaths data are made available to all public bodies through REACH via the inter-agency messaging service. This is of considerable value <Col N="1717"/>to public bodies in managing schemes such as medical cards, pensions and so on. Statistical data are also transferred electronically to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and this greatly improves the ability of the CSO to manage, analyse and report such data which is essential for public policy and planning.</P>
        <P>A further contract was subsequently entered into by my Department with the same firm for the provision of support and maintenance and for minor enhancements to the civil registration computer system. This contract was awarded following a competitive tendering process which was carried out in accordance with EU and Department of Finance procurement rules. The contract is for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2005. The amounts paid to date to the firm in question are as follows: 2004, &euro;560,457.60 and 2005, &euro;491,219.28.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme has been recognised nationally and internationally as an excellent example of best practice in public administration and has received awards from the EU, the European Institute of Public Administration, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Computerworld</i> magazine. I am satisfied that the modernisation programme has resulted in a greatly improved service to the public and to public service organisations and represents value for money.</P>

	<P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the delivery of health services. The Health Act 2004 provides that the object of the executive is to use the resources available to it in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public. I fully support the work of the board of the executive and its chief executive officer in the pursuit of these objectives. Under Section 31 of the 2004 Act, the executive is obliged to prepare, adopt and then submit to me for approval a service plan for the financial year or other period as may be determined by me.</P>
        <P>I approved the executive&rsquo;s national service plan for 2005. The plan covers all the main programmes of care and treatment for the health services and sets down projected activity levels for those programmes. The plan also describes the objectives of the programmes and the actions to achieve these objectives. It outlines the key issues for the year ahead and the mechanisms to monitor it. Initiatives in regard to research, quality, evaluation and value for money are also covered. In line with the provisions of the Act, I ensured that a copy of the 2005 service plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The implementation of the plan is the operational responsibility of the executive and is the subject of ongoing monitoring by my Department and the executive. The executive reports to me on a regular basis in regard to the achievement of targets described for each programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under Section 29 of the 2004 Act, the executive is obliged to prepare, adopt and then submit to me for approval a corporate plan for the three year period following its submission. The executive has submitted its corporate plan for 2005-08 in accordance with the provisions of this section. It incorporates a vision and mission informed by the goals of the health strategy and tailored to reflect the functions of the executive as a body with responsibility for delivering services. I have approved the corporate plan and I will ensure that a copy is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 21 October 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 347 and 356 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed that, on the initiative of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s chief executive officer, work is under way to examine organisational arrangements. The overall aim is to simplify a number of key management functions, with a view to more integration, consistency and accountability for patients and frontline staff in the management and delivery of services.</P>
        <P>The executive has advised my Department that a proposal is being considered to put in place four administrative regions for hospital services. These regions would be co-terminus with the existing four regional structures for the delivery of primary community and continuing care. This is being considered with a view to achieving greater integration and co-ordination in the management of health services between hospital services and primary, community and continuing care services.</P>
        <P>The executive has emphasised that the examination of the organisational structures is at an early stage and that no final proposals have emerged as yet. During the coming weeks, the board and senior management group will be advancing the initiative. Under the Health Act 2004, the executive has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services. The organisational arrangements currently under consideration are a matter for the executive.</P>

	<P>The prevention and control of hospital acquired infections, including MRSA, is a priority issue for the Health Service Executive. Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired infections, including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has published guidelines on hand hygiene and guidelines on the control of MRSA for hospital and community settings. These significant documents give clear policy and practice guidance to health care workers on the control of hospital acquired infections, including MRSA. Good hand hygiene is one of the simplest and most effective measures that can be used to stop the spread of MRSA and other infections.</P>
        <P>The national hygiene audit has been completed and a report has been sent to the director of the national hospitals office. The results of the audit <Col N="1721"/>will form the basis for the changes that are required in both work environments and work practices so as to meet the highest possible standards of cleanliness in hospital settings. As I have already promised, the results of the hygiene audit will be made public.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive will also publish national infection control standards and national cleaning standards &mdash; a consistent and robust set of hygiene standards for hospitals. Where previously standards may have depended on the approach of a particular hospital or health board, the Health Service Executive can now ensure every hospital will share and meet the same high standards of cleanliness and infection control.</P>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield from taxation of child benefit at each taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal tax rate is tentatively estimated at &euro;377 million in 2005 terms. This figure is provisional and likely to be revised. Furthermore, it does not include the yield from income earners whose current income levels do not exceed the existing thresholds of exemption limits or tax credits and who could be brought into the tax net if child benefit payments were included as taxable income. If this amount was also taken into account, the yield in a full year is very tentatively estimated at approximately &euro;400 million.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking, the tax system treats members of cohabiting couples as separate and unconnected individuals. Each partner is a separate entity for tax purposes and credits, and bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other. There are no special favourable tax arrangements for cohabiting couples with dependent children.</P>
        <P>The working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, which reported in August 1999, was sympathetic, in principle, to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options it set out should be considered further. However, it acknowledged in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples that a key issue is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law.</P>
        <P>The Law Reform Commission published a consultation paper on the rights and duties of cohabitees in April 2004. That paper indicated that in the light of the current policy with regard to individualisation of the tax bands, the commission was not recommending any change to the income tax treatment of cohabiting couples.</P>
        <P>Child benefit is the main instrument through which support is provided to parents in respect of qualifying children and this is available whether the parents are single, cohabiting or married. The Government has substantially increased child benefit since coming into office in 1997. Overall expenditure on child benefit has increased by 279% from &euro;506 million in 1997 to an estimated &euro;1.916 billion in 2005. At the same time, I have indicated to the House previously that I believe there is a need to examine pragmatically and practically what can be done in regard to providing child care support to parents.</P>
        <P>I have also put on the record of the House that I would view as problematic and unwise a situation where changes in the tax code relating <Col N="1727"/>to the treatment of couples would set a headline in advance of developments in other relevant areas of public policy, for example, in the area of legal recognition of relationships other than married relationships. I am still of that view.</P>

	<P>The OPW is committed to incorporating principles of sustainable design and energy efficiency into all of its building projects in line with Government policy on sustainable design and its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol. In relation to the decentralisation programme it has prepared a substantial briefing document that forms part of the tender documentation for locations that are being procured on a design build basis. This document has issued already to tenderers for locations at Athlone, Newcastlewest and Killarney.</P>
        <P>The briefing document provides a qualitative definition of the requirements to be provided by contractors in the design and construction of the building as well as referring them to relevant guidelines and publications. It also sets out for <Col N="1728"/>each location the scope of the project and the requirements of the building particularly in relation to the building regulations, the local planning authority and the Safety Health and Welfare Act, accessibility, sustainability, environment and building performance and so on. Moreover, in the award process for these projects the approach will be to reward sustainable design.</P>

        <P>Under the per cent for art scheme, the OPW purchases and commissions art works for all capital construction projects under its management. Art works have been acquired by the OPW for hundreds of public buildings throughout Ireland <Col N="1730"/>&mdash; including Garda stations, court houses, offices of the Revenue Commissioners, offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other regional Government offices. The OPW is also responsible for the management of art works in hundreds of heritage properties and major parks that are all easily accessible to the public.</P>
        <P>Other Government Departments, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Department of Health and Children, Department of Education and Science, and Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, are responsible for the management and implementation of the per cent for art scheme in their own capital projects.</P>
        <P>The OPW has no role in the distribution of per cent for art funds for local authority projects &mdash; these fall under the management of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Arts officers and public arts officers in the local authorities are involved in the administration of per cent for art projects in communities throughout Ireland. The OPW is committed to maximum use of the per cent for art scheme and has embraced its use fully in public buildings throughout Ireland. This commitment is demonstrated in all the building projects in which the OPW has been involved in recent years.</P>

	<P>In the 2005 budget, I announced a comprehensive programme of reviews of a broad range of tax incentive schemes and tax exemptions. Many of these schemes are being reviewed internally within the Department of Finance and the Office of the <Col N="1732"/>Revenue Commissioners. In addition, following a competitive tendering process, two external consultancy firms were retained to conduct reviews of the range of property-based tax incentive schemes. The two firms in question are Goodbody Economic Consultants and Indecon International Economic Consultants.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference for the consultancy studies are set out in a press release issued on 6 January 2005, which is publicly available on the press releases section of my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.finance.gov.ie</i>. Completed reports from the two consultancy firms are expected shortly. I am not yet in a position to indicate any likely publication date for these studies.</P>
        <P>As regards costs, the contracts stipulate that Indecon International Economic Consultants are to be paid the sum of &euro;224,004, before VAT, in respect of the review of certain property-based schemes, and that Goodbody Economic Consultants are to be paid the sum of &euro;155,400, before VAT, in respect of the review of area-based tax incentive renewal schemes.</P>

As indicated already in reply to other questions on this issue, my Department and Revenue are also carrying out an examination on a series of other reliefs within Civil Service resources.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 389 together.</P>
        <P>The staffing of my Department&rsquo;s press office consists of a press officer, a higher executive officer, an executive officer and a clerical officer. With the exception of the press officer, each of the other staff members is entitled to claim overtime at standard Civil Service rates in respect of additional attendance outside normal office hours. They do not receive any other type of payment to compensate for such attendance. The press officer, who is also a civil servant but is in a non-overtime grade, is in receipt of an allowance equivalent to 10% of salary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with established procedures in Civil Service employment, my Department permits time off in lieu to grades which are entitled to paid overtime, generally staff up to the level of higher executive officer. This permits staff to avail of extra time off rather than pay for extra attendance. Such agreements are agreed in advance and must be consistent with the work demands. This is dealt with in individual sections and a central record is not maintained. Officers at APO level and above are not entitled to paid overtime. The salary and terms and conditions for such officers are intended to cover significant extra attendance. However, in the case of one such officer, who undertook significant additional attendance over a prolonged period between 2002 and 2004, arrangements are being made to recognise this attendance through a combination of annual leave, additional leave and paid study leave.</P>

	<P>The holding and use of personal information is governed by the Data Protection Act 1988 and the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003. On commencing employment with the Department, all staff are informed of these requirements and sign confirming knowledge and acceptance of these requirements. In addition, staff with access to personnel files are briefed on the confidential nature of their work. All personnel files in this Department are safely and securely maintained in the personnel unit.</P>
        <P>In the course of matters relating to sick leave, an employee&rsquo;s personal sick leave details may be passed to the office of the chief medical officer for the Civil Service for advice in the normal course of events. Where requests for information from other bodies are received, the advice of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is obtained, and the matter dealt with accordingly.</P>

	<P>Since 2003, my Department has permitted two staff at HEO-AO-APO grades, to participate in the masters programme in policy analysis administered by the Centre for Management and Organisation Development, leading to an MSc in policy analysis from UCD.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Participants enter into a contract which provides for refund of course fees and salary in the event of the person leaving the Civil Service within two years of completion of the course. Participants are also required to reach a satisfactory standard for attendance, course work and satisfactory performance in the programme. The selected candidates from 2003 have satisfactorily completed the two-year course of study and have been placed in work units appropriate to their newly acquired skills. A further four staff are currently engaged in the programme, two in first year and two in second year.</P>
        <P>My Department supported, as a pilot project, participation of two staff at administrative officer level, in the masters programme in economics in UCD in the academic year 2004-05. The course fees were pre-funded and full paid leave for one academic year was approved with strict pre-conditions, signed and agreed by staff and management, that they attend all lectures, complete all <Col N="1737"/>project work satisfactorily, pass all exams and agree to work in an appropriate area of the Department for a further period of three years following completion of the course. All fees must be refunded if these staff leave the public service within two years of completing the course. Both participants in the pilot project have completed the programme successfully.</P>
        <P>The Department has granted career breaks, that is unpaid special leave, to six staff, from clerical officer to assistant principal level since 2002. The career breaks ranged from six months duration to five years.</P>

The expected total cost of the scheme for 2005 is approximately &euro;62,000. Three staff members who were approved to undertake a course under the scheme in the academic year 2004-05 did not subsequently apply for a refund of fees, as they did not pursue the particular courses.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which nursing homes that cease to operate will be identified by Revenue in order to recoup the allowances and grant as is specified in law in view of the fact that since nursing homes which have availed of the capital allowances tax clawback must continue to operate as such for ten years after opting into this scheme, and since the Revenue Commissioners do not identify where capital allowances are applied.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of registered nursing homes may be written off for tax purposes over seven years at the rate of 15% per annum over the first six years and 10% in the seventh year. To qualify for allowances the home must be operated or managed as a registered nursing home within the meaning of section 2 of the Health (Nursing <Col N="1742"/>Homes) Act 1990 and be registered under section 4 of that Act.</P>
        <P>Where a nursing home ceases to operate, entitlement to further allowances is lost. Also, there is provision for the clawback of any allowances already claimed where a nursing home is sold, for instance, or ceases to be used. The clawback, known as a balancing charge, can be applied at any time up to ten years after a nursing home was first used.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, under the self-assessment system, the onus is on the taxpayer in the first instance to advise Revenue of changes in his or her circumstances, including when a business ceases. I am further informed that when tax returns are submitted to the tax district for processing, all cessation cases are specifically reviewed by an officer and the question of clawback, if appropriate, would be considered as part of that review. Where a tax return is not submitted, it will be pursued under the annual returns compliance programme and <Col N="1743"/>followed through to prosecution if appropriate. Nursing homes, in common with all businesses, are also included in Revenue&rsquo;s audit programme.</P>

	<P>The Government is supporting <Col N="1744"/>the development of the seafood industry through a number of programmes under the aegis of the national development plan. This development support is supplemented by measures such as the recent Government decision to introduce a fleet decommissioning scheme over the next two years at a cost of &euro;45 million to enhance the overall economic viability of the whitefish and shellfish sectors.</P>
        <P>The scope for further development of the industry over the next ten to 15 years will be determined in the context of the next national plan for the period 2007 to 2013. In this regard, extensive discussions have already been held at EU level regarding a new European fisheries fund to apply over the period 2007 to 2013.</P>
        <P>Once the terms of the new European Fisheries Fund have been agreed at EU level, the Department and BIM, in consultation with the industry stakeholders, will commence the process of preparing a national strategic plan and operational programmes for the various sectors of the seafood industry which will clearly set out the potential for future development of the industry in terms of output, income and employment over the next ten years.</P>
        <P>The future turnover and growth potential of the fishing industry in Ireland and elsewhere will critically depend on having healthy fish stocks and ensuring that they are harvested on a sustainable basis. In light of the increased emphasis on stock conservation in recent years under the successfully reformed Common Fisheries Policy in 2002, I am satisfied the industry can have a bright future and that will be the driving aim in the formulation of future development plans for the industry.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407, 408 and 412 together.</P>
        <P>A scheme to decommission fishing vessels was launched on 4 October. This scheme has been introduced to remove excess capacity in our whitefish and shellfish fleets, in the face of decreasing fishing opportunities brought about by cuts in fish quotas. As there can be no expectation of increased catches in the short term, this scheme is designed to target those fishermen who find themselves in a position where they are no longer getting an economic return and to deliver a sustainable future for those that remain in the industry. The aim of the scheme is to remove up to 25% from the whitefish fleet and reduce the scallop fleet to 4,800 kW. This is necessary to achieve balance between the available fishing opportunities and the economic requirements of these sections of the fleet.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;45 million has been allocated for this scheme to decommission fishing boats. Of this total, &euro;8.8 million is already provided for under the national development plan which runs to 2006, of which 75%, &euro;6.6 million, is funded from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, FIFG, with the remaining 25%, &euro;2.2 million, being met through matching Exchequer funding. The future mechanism for EU funding after 2006 has yet to be finalised at EU level. Given that the decommissioning scheme has only just been launched, no spend has taken place so far in 2005.</P>

        <P>With regard to the monitoring and regulation of managed sea fisheries the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has an inspectorate composed of sea fishery officers. These officers attend to the dual responsibilities of the control and regulation of managed fisheries and regulation of food safety related to fish, fishery products and shellfish. The total expenditure incurred in discharging these responsibilities, including the salaries paid to the inspectors and the administrative support personnel involved in this work and any ancillary expenses for equipment and activities, is estimated as being &euro;4.3 million for 2005.</P>
        <P>The projected budgetary requirement for 2006 for these inspection and control activities is estimated at being approximately &euro;6 million. This reflects the emerging trend in European Community legislation that requires member states to provide a system of control for fisheries conservation that meets specific standards laid down in Community law. This, in turn, has placed additional demands on the existing complement of sea fishery officers and consequently the Department has had to seek additional inspection personnel to ensure Ireland can meet its legal obligations as a European Union member state. Following recent Government sanction the Department has now advertised to fill these additional sea fishery officer posts.</P>

However, an analysis of the 1996 census data carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute on behalf of the national strategy review group on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy covering the ports of Greencastle, Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere and Dunmore East, found that the percentage of employment in these ports in fishing and related industries ranged between 43% and 69%.

	<P>There is no definitive list held in the Department of all commercial fishing vessels lost at sea. Furthermore, not all vessels lost at sea are reported as being lost. In the period from January 1995 to December 2004 there have been 23 vessels that were the subject of a marine investigation or inquiry following the sinking or loss of that vessel at sea. These vessels were described as fishing vessels in the context of the investigation or inquiry held. The number of deaths that occurred as a result of the loss of these vessels is 32 persons.</P>
        <P>There is no State funding as suggested by the Deputy other than supports available under the social welfare code. There was a limited lost at sea scheme put in place in 2001 by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural <Col N="1751"/>Resources, enabling the provision of fishing boat capacity to qualifying applicants in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and 1990. The purpose of this scheme was not to compensate families for loss of family earnings but to facilitate a family member in continuing a family tradition of commercial fishing. The scheme did not apply to fishing boats lost at sea after 1990 when the current sea-fishing boat register was set up because the capacity of vessels which were included on the register after 1990 is available for transfer to another person, whether it be a family member or otherwise, in accordance with the provisions of sea-fishing boat licensing policy.</P>

	<P>It is presumed that the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to &ldquo;valuable marine life&rdquo; concerns the exploitation of fishery resources. The management of fishery resources in an EU context is governed by the Common Fisheries Policy. This policy sets out a number of strategies for the protection of fishery resources, including a strengthened control and enforcement system, recovery plans for stocks outside safe biological limits, action to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches, and catch and effort limitations. Furthermore, following a conference organised by the Irish Presidency in 2004 on environmentally friendly fishing methods, and discussions to be held with member states and stakeholders, the Commission is expected to <Col N="1752"/>bring forward a new proposal on technical conservation measures in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>A high level of co-operation already exists between Ireland and other EU member states in the marine area, in particular in relation to marine emergency preparedness and response, maritime safety, ship and port security, and fisheries policy. The Department has taken a leading co-ordination role for the EU representative group on the proposed Green Paper on European maritime policy. The first consultation meeting of member states was held on 29 September 2005. It is expected that the proposed Green Paper will cover a wide range of issues including transport, shipbuilding, tourism, fishing, water quality, oil and gas extraction, the conservation of species, and the protection of the marine environment.</P>
        <P>With reference to fisheries policy, a key objective of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, is to ensure that there is co-operation and co-ordination between member states to achieve compliance with the rules of the CFP. In particular the CFP places considerable emphasis on the need for co-operation in the area of control and enforcement. In this regard the Council of Fisheries Ministers agreed in March of this year to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency. A key objective of this agency is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between member states in areas of control and enforcement. It is expected the agency will become operational in 2006 and I am confident it will succeed in the objective outlined above.</P>
        <P>There are also significant moves under way to improve co-operation between member states at stakeholder level. Regional advisory councils, RACs, have been established for pelagic stocks, north western waters and the North Sea. These are three of a proposed seven RACs to come into being. The principle of establishing RACs was agreed as part of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002, as a means of increasing stakeholder involvement in and ownership of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, as well as improving communications and relations between fishermen and other stakeholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Since taking up my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I have reaffirmed the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the scientific advice that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits as soon as possible. In keeping with this policy, when setting the commercial salmon quotas for the 2005 season, I gave a firm commitment to fully align the exploitation of salmon, both at national and district levels, on the scientific advice by 2007.</P>
        <P>To achieve this, I have asked the new National Salmon Commission to advise as to how best the alignment of exploitation of salmon with the scientific advice can be implemented by 2007, bearing in mind the requirement to ensure the future biological viability of the salmon resource in all catchments and also the needs of all stakeholders, including those who derive their living from the wild salmon resource. I will examine carefully all recommendations, including those relevant to drift netting, made by the salmon commission in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the potential for economic development of the salmon resource, I am fully aware of the suggestions to the effect that there may be greater economic potential for the State to be derived from the development of the angling tourism sector than from the commercial fishing sector where salmon is concerned. I am also aware, however, that consultations conducted by State agencies on these claims have elicited widely divergent views among stakeholders not only on the relative value of the sectors but also on the methodology adopted to arrive at those values. No consensus has been reached on any suggestions that a rebalancing of exploitation of the salmon resource in favour of tourism angling would deliver significant benefits to the State from a public good perspective.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To provide some clarity on this particular issue, however, the Department has asked the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the relevant State agencies under its aegis, to apply their expertise in evaluating the role and contribution of salmon angling tourism and to present a definitive view of its potential within the broader tour<Col N="1754"/>ism sector. It is my belief that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long term sustainable fishery for both sectors.</P>

	<P>Work on geothermal energy in Ireland has been undertaken by the Geological Survey of Ireland since the late 1970s in co-operation with university departments and the private sector and supported by the European Commission. Most of the work focused on areas where warm springs indicated medium-depth resources. Exploitation has been on a small scale and inhibited by relatively low prices for other energy sources.</P>
        <P>Recent sharp rises in hydrocarbon fuel prices have rightly stimulated fresh interest in geothermal energy. Most recently a geothermal resource map of Ireland was produced on behalf of Sustainable Energy Ireland by the CSA Group, in co-operation with Cork Institute of Technology and the Geological Survey of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The study aimed to identify potential resources of geothermal energy in Ireland, gather the necessary data for geothermal models of Ireland, produce geothermal maps of Ireland and a geothermal database, review the current status and use of geothermal resources in Ireland, and make recommendations for future geothermal exploitation in Ireland. The review indicated good potential for using ground source heat pumps and significant deeper geothermal resources with potential for commercial development. Defining the extent and quantity of those resources will require additional work.</P>
        <P>The Geological Survey of Ireland, in co-operation with a wide range of public and private geoscience interests, has recently presented a new geoscience initiative for consideration by Government. Among other things, this proposes substantial new research into geothermal potential in Ireland.</P>

        <P>My Northern Ireland counterpart, Angela Smith MP, and I jointly issued a consultation paper on an all-island 2020 vision for renewable energy electricity. This document indicates a potential wave and tidal energy electricity generation installed capacity of approximately 5 MW in the 2010 to 2012 period. It estimates an installed capacity for wave energy alone of 6 MW by 2020 for the all Ireland electricity market.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that wave energy systems are in a development stage worldwide and are not commercially available. Wave and marine tidal energy are typically considered under the same heading as ocean energy. The development status and issues facing both technologies are closely related. SEI and the Marine Institute have made recent estimates for the potential growth rate for ocean energy systems assuming the first reliable ocean energy systems become available in Ireland by 2010. It is estimated that 4 MW of demonstration systems could be generating electricity by 2010 in Ireland and increasing incrementally thereafter.</P>

	<P>I have instructed my officials to draft a comprehensive policy statement which fully addresses the issues and challenges that lie ahead in the energy area. It is my intention that the policy paper will have both a medium and a long-term perspective, explaining the policies that are in place now and which will have a direct effect over the next five years or so, and also looking forward to 2020 and beyond to assess what our energy needs might be and what policies we might adopt to ensure that those needs can be met in a sustainable way. Estimates of energy demand in the future will always depend on assumptions about a range of variables, including fuel prices. Work on all aspects of the policy paper, including estimates of energy demand in 2020, are under way but have not been completed. I aim to have a completed paper ready for publication in 2006.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Balbriggan and Skerries harbours were transferred to the control of Fingal County Council in 2004 under the Harbours Act 1996. Government policy in relation to ports, including the 11 regional harbours, is set out in the ports policy statement published in January this year by the Department. The policy statement notes that many regional harbours have neither the resources nor the capability to comply with aspects of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, whereas their transfer to local authority control would bring improved corporate governance and allow the harbours to realise their amenity potential. The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of regional harbours to local authority control.</P>
        <P>The Department has invested in essential public safety works at a number of regional harbours in 2004 and plans to continue with a similar programme of works in 2005 and 2006. The Department proposes to make funds available to allow additional works to be undertaken at the regional harbours where appropriate and justifiable, to protect the public and the fabric of the harbours. The Department is assessing what essential works might be undertaken in 2005 and 2006 within the limited budget available. A submission regarding works required at Balbriggan and Skerries harbours has been received in the Department and forwarded to the Department&rsquo;s engineering division for its evaluation.</P>

	<P>The central and regional fisher<Col N="1761"/>ies boards devote considerable effort and resources, in collaboration with Tourism Ireland, to the promotion of angling abroad. I understand, however, that the overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003, observes a decline in activity holidays which is not confined to angling but also includes cycling and hillwalking.</P>
        <P>While I am aware of the argument that the effect of drift netting on salmon stocks is a reason for the decline in angling tourism in Ireland I am not, however, aware of any study having been carried out that supports this particular premise. I am advised that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is carrying out research among tour operators involved in promoting special activity holidays and special activity holidaymakers.</P>
        <P>Problems identified include rising costs and access to activities. F&aacute;ilte Ireland has, I understand, also identified angling among main areas of activity for which detailed marketing plans have been agreed, targeting the markets offering the best short-term return. Several other supporting activities are identified across all products including greater understanding of international trends in demand for special interest products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is my belief that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long-term sustainable fishery for both sectors.</P>

        <Quest>if the personnel files of staff in his Department have been copied or given to external parties; if so, the safeguards which have been put in place to ensure that no personal data of any member of staff in his Department will be released to third parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department places great emphasis on safeguarding the confidentiality of all personal data held on staff&rsquo;s personnel files. To that end, systems are in place to ensure that all such data is kept secure and is only accessible to a limited number of authorised staff within the Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are only three circumstances in which personnel files of staff in my Department may be copied or given to external parties. First, in the case of long-term absenteeism on sick leave, the practice until recently had been for the individual&rsquo;s personnel file to be referred to the chief medical officer for review. In such instances, a strict operational regime was in place which involved the file in question being delivered by hand from my Department directly to the chief medical officer, whose office is keenly aware of the confidential nature of personnel files. This system has recently been revised with the introduction of a case referral form, which obviates the need for transmitting the entire personnel file. <Col N="1764"/>Second, my Department has occasionally released data from individual personnel files to solicitors representing those individuals, but only with the consent of the individuals themselves.</P>
        <P>Third, in the case of investigations carried out under the Civil Service disciplinary code, it may be necessary, in the event of the individuals concerned invoking their right of appeal against the findings of the investigation, to make available to the Civil Service disciplinary appeals board all, or relevant papers from, the individual&rsquo;s personnel file. The entire disciplinary procedure is, however, carried out to the highest standards of confidentiality.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>the number of staff in his Department to whom leave of absence, or any other absence from normal duties or place of work, in excess of two months was granted for educational purposes in any year since 2002; the nature of the educational course undertaken in each case; if there are terms or conditions relating to academic achievement attached to the granting of such leave; if personnel who were granted such leave failed to complete their courses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The accompanying table shows the position regarding five members of staff in my Department who have been granted leave of absence for a period in excess of two months for educational purposes. The granting of special leave or career breaks for educational purposes is not conditional on attaining any particular level of academic achievement or on completion of the course in question.</P>
        <P>A further two members of staff of my Department were released from duty for a period of two years in order to pursue an MSc in public policy analysis programme under the terms and conditions of Department of Finance circular 13/2003 and have successfully completed their studies. Another two staff members are partaking in subsequent programmes.</P><Col N="1763"/>

	<P>My Department has purchased 77 personal digital assistants over the last four years, at a total cost of &euro;10,105. The most expensive single unit was purchased for &euro;756 in 2002, when units were considerably more expensive than today. The personal digital assistants are issued to individual officers based on a business case endorsed by their superior and accepted by the service delivery manager in information systems division who has effective final say in the matter.</P>
        <P>The use of personal digital assistants enhances accessibility and business efficiency, particularly for technical professional staff operating in the field and staff engaged in regular travel on official business. The increasing convergence of these devices with voice communication and remote access to back-office systems such as electronic mail is rapidly enhancing their utility.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question arises from the publication, earlier this month, of Ireland and the European Union: Identifying Priorities and Pursuing Goals . Following the referendum results in France and the Netherlands, the European Council decided at its meeting in June to initiate a period of reflection and national debate with regard to the European constitution, involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliamentarians and political parties.</P>
        <P>The Government intends to use this period of reflection to promote enhanced public awareness of EU issues vital to Ireland, including the European constitution, whose ratification remains a key objective. The White Paper on the European constitution, which was published on 13 October, is an important step in this direction. It provides the public with a clear and factual explanation of the various elements in the constitution.</P>
        <P>The national forum on Europe will continue to play a leading role in facilitating increased public engagement with the range of EU issues that are vital for Ireland. It is envisaged that there will be an Oireachtas debate on the European constitution and the challenges facing Europe. Non-governmental and voluntary organisations also have vital roles to play in raising awareness of European issues. My Department&rsquo;s communicating Europe initiative will be supporting a range of projects, carried out by NGOs, aimed at improving public awareness of how the EU works and what it means for Ireland.</P>

        <P>The White Paper was written within the Department of Foreign Affairs and provides a clear and factual explanation of the various elements of the constitution and the Government&rsquo;s approach to its negotiation. The text of the original foreword was updated to reflect the European Council&rsquo;s decision to opt for a period of reflection, thus delaying the ratification process.

	<P>Ireland established resident diplomatic relations with Russia in 1973. Relations with Russia are important to Ireland, as they are to our EU partners and to the European Union. A number of high level bilateral visits have taken place in recent years. During my visit to Moscow on 4 July <Col N="1772"/>2005, in my capacity as special envoy of the UNSG on UN reform, I discussed Ireland-Russia relations in some depth with the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov. I availed of the opportunity to reactivate bilateral links following the Troika presidency period during which our focus was on EU relations with Russia. A number of regional issues of mutual interest also came up.</P>
        <P>In line with understandings reached during my visit in July, a meeting of the joint intergovernmental commission for the development of business co-operation in Dublin at the start of next year is being actively prepared. A visit by the foreign affairs committee of the Russian Duma is also expected next year, in reciprocation of the visit of the Ceann Comhairle and a parliamentary delegation to Russia in late March and early April 2005. In recent years there have been regular ministerial visits to Russia for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. This year the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keefe, visited Moscow over this period.</P>
        <P>Other significant recent visits include that by the Taoiseach in May 2004, as President of the European Council, for the EU-Russia summit. The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, visited Ireland in April 2004 to meet with the EU Troika during our Presidency.</P>
        <P>The total value of trade between Ireland and Russia in 2004 was &euro;273 million and Russia is our 36th largest trade partner. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, visited Russia in May and June of this year, with Irish companies in the software and education sectors and in the meat sector, respectively. A range of cultural and educational links has also been developed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 453 and 454 together.</P>
        <P>We have all been shocked and saddened by the destruction wreaked by the natural disasters which hit Pakistan and Central America. I made a detailed statement on the Government&rsquo;s response to these crises during the special D&aacute;il debate on the matter last Wednesday.</P><Col N="1773"/>
        <P>With regard to northern Pakistan and affected neighbouring areas, Ireland has allocated &euro;3 million to assist in the immediate relief effort. I have been closely following the situation since the earthquake on Saturday, 8 October. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, I pledged &euro;1 million towards relief efforts in northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions at a time when the first estimates of casualties were only a fraction of the current assessments. I remained in contact over the following days with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, other colleagues in Government, my senior officials and key individuals such as the Ambassador of Pakistan, H.E. Mr. Toheed Ahmad, and representatives of the Pakistani community in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Following an updated assessment of the situation on Monday, 10 October, I made a further pledge of &euro;2 million, to bring to &euro;3 million the amount pledged by Ireland in assistance to the region. A total of &euro;1.2 million of this funding has been allocated to UN agencies, including UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. A sum of &euro;300,000 has been allocated to the International Federation of the Red Cross. Up to &euro;1.5 million is available for non-governmental organisations which are active in the provision of services on the ground. Priority areas in the relief effort have been identified by the United Nations as health, nutrition, logistics, shelter, camp management, water and sanitation, protection, information and telecommunications and recovery.</P>
        <P>With respect to the humanitarian emergency situation in Central America, Ireland has been liaising with the UN, the International Red Cross and Irish non-governmental organisations, working directly or through partners in the area, to define immediate needs. Severe flooding made worse by the remnants of Hurricane Stan has deluged vast areas of Central America, including El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. In response to this appalling disaster, I have allocated funding of &euro;1 million for humanitarian relief. These funds are being allocated among the Red Cross, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs and non-governmental organisations providing services locally.</P>
        <P>On a global funding basis, in 2005 Ireland has already made separate contributions of over &euro;9.5 million to the UN High Commission for Refugees and &euro;3 million to UNICEF for their worldwide operations. These funds are deliberately not earmarked to ensure that they can be utilised quickly and effectively for emergency and humanitarian planning and rapid responses by these key UN agencies. Over &euro;2 million was released to the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Activities to facilitate that agency&rsquo;s <Col N="1774"/>capacity to co-ordinate relief efforts. Our early funding provides much needed cash flow for these agencies so that they are better equipped to deal with sudden-onset emergencies.</P>
        <P>Funding to develop NGO capacity has also been made available through the multiannual programme scheme, which offers predictable funding over a period of years around which the NGOs can plan. This type of funding has helped them to respond to major humanitarian emergencies in a more effective and timely manner.</P>
        <P>We will continue to monitor the situation in both of these regions closely, with the assistance of UN agencies and partner organisations, particularly in the NGO community, to ensure that our assistance is being effectively targeted.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am aware of the concern expressed by the special representative of the UN Secretary General in Kosovo and head of the United Nations interim administration mission in Kosovo, UNMIK, Mr Soren Jessen-Petersen, at the conditions in which many displaced families from minority Serb, Roma and other communities are still living in Kosovo and in neighbouring regions of Serbia. I share his specific concerns regarding the conditions in which Roma families are living in northern Kosovo, including the effect on their health of emissions from a toxic waste dump in the area.</P>
        <P>Mr. Jessen-Petersen has stated that &euro;1.3 million is required to enable the relocation of these families. In July, Ireland agreed to provide funding of &euro;250,000 to the Roma Mahala project, administered by UNMIK, which is intended to achieve this. This amount has been pledged over two years; &euro;100,000 in 2005 and &euro;150,000 in 2006.</P>
        <P>The issue of displaced persons from the conflict must be resolved if there is to be a truly multiethnic society in Kosovo, as provided for under UN Security Council Resolution 1244. UNMIK, with the full support of the EU, is seeking to uphold the right of all internally displaced persons in Kosovo to return to their homes. Realistically, this will not be fully achieved in the absence of substantial political progress.</P>
        <P>Kosovo has been under UN administration since the end of the conflict in June 1999, in accordance with UNSCR 1244. The UN Secretary General has appointed a special representative, Ambassador Kai Eide of Norway, to prepare a comprehensive review of the implementation of reforms based on European standards in Kosovo. <Col N="1775"/>Last week Ambassador Eide presented his report to the UN Secretary General in New York and I look forward to the Security Council&rsquo;s consideration of the report in the near future. It is widely expected that there will be a decision to open a process to agree the constitutional status of Kosovo.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two aspects to this issue, namely, the provision of grievance and discipline procedures for locally recruited staff in Irish missions abroad and, second, determining how such staff pursue pay, grade and related matters in the absence of agreement with management.</P>
        <P>In the former case, following consultation with union representatives and with heads of Irish missions abroad, as well as the examination of best practice in other foreign services, detailed circulars outlining procedures for dealing with grievances and disciplinary issues have now been prepared and will issue shortly to missions.</P>
        <P>The grievance circular is designed to ensure that locally recruited staff at missions are entitled, in the same way as their Civil Service colleagues in Ireland, to carry out their duties free from any form of harassment, including sexual harassment or bullying. It will not, however, deal with pay, grade or related issues.</P>
        <P>The disciplinary circular is designed to ensure that locally recruited staff are dealt with in a fair and equitable manner and to provide a procedure by which impropriety can be dealt with effectively, thus ensuring the highest standard of conduct are maintained.</P>
        <P>With regard to pay, grade and related matters, and following the Labour Court recommendation <Col N="1776"/>referred to by the Deputy, the feasibility of having Irish union representation for locally recruited staff in missions is under consideration. The Department is well disposed towards this.</P>
        <P>The Department has also undertaken a wider review of all the issues involved. In view of the legal complexity of some of the issues, this is being conducted jointly by the human resources and legal divisions of the Department. It will also be necessary to seek the views and guidance of the Attorney General. This review is being given the highest priority.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the traditional procedure for dealing with pay, grade and related claims remains in place. This, in summary, provides for the relevant head of mission to consider claims by local staff and to make a recommendation to the Department, where it is fully considered. If considered necessary, and in particular in circumstances where a satisfactory outcome for all sides is not achieved, the public service division of the Department of Finance is consulted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.</P>
        <P>The press adviser, who is a non-established State employee, remains on call after normal hours and does not receive any additional payment over and above his stated salary. An officer of the Department&rsquo;s press section is on duty each weekend to co-ordinate the issuing of press statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers of State in response to unanticipated events and to enable media queries to be responded to promptly. The weekend press duty officer receives an allowance of &euro;120.</P>
        <P>Each weekday morning, from 8 a.m. onwards, a third secretary and a clerical officer attached to the press section prepare press summaries for the Minister and the Ministers of State. These are also widely circulated throughout the Department at headquarters and to our 75 missions abroad. Overtime payments in respect of that and any other extra attendance approved from time to time are made in line with standard Civil Service rates. The Department&rsquo;s press officer, a first secretary, receives an annual allowance of &euro;2,539.48 in respect of being on call and for additional attendance after normal working hours.</P>

	<P>The arrangements agreed centrally between the Department of Finance and relevant Civil Service unions under which officers serving in certain general service and departmental grades may be compensated, financially or by way of leave in lieu, for extra attendance are set out in Department of Finance circular 27/99. Under this circular, where leave in lieu is preferred to payment, overtime hours worked during the period Monday to Friday accrue at the flat rate. More favourable rates apply in respect of Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, when leave in lieu generally accrues at the rate of time plus one half.</P>
        <P>The above arrangements apply only to officers serving in grades up to and including higher executive officer and equivalent. It would be inappropriate to publicise the names of the individual officers who have accrued or availed of leave in lieu of overtime.</P>

        <Quest>if the personnel files of staff in his Department have been copied or given to external parties; if so, the safeguards which have been put in place to ensure that no personal data of any member of staff in his Department will be released to third parties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The only case where personnel files of staff have been copied or given to external parties has been where they have been transferred, on request, to the chief medical officer at the Civil Service occupational health department. Until recently, it had been the practice of the Department&rsquo;s human resources section to send personnel files to the chief medical officer in cases where professional medical advice was required by the Department. That practice was discontinued on the advice of the chief medical officer and instead a written report on the case in a format suggested by the chief medical officer is now normally sent. The full files are forwarded only if requested by the chief medical officer.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>The personnel files of the staff of the Department are treated as strictly confidential. They are held in a secure area within the human resources section. Neither the files nor the data thereon would be released or made available to third parties by the personnel officer, with the exception of the chief medical officer, without the consent of the officer concerned. A request from the Garda for information from a personnel file as part of a criminal investigation would be granted.</P>

	<P>I presume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to cases involving leave of absence where the officer continued to receive his or her salary. Four such cases have arisen in the Department of Foreign Affairs in the period in question.</P>
        <P>Department of Finance circular 15/2004 invited applications from officers serving as higher executive officers or administrative officers or in equivalent grades to compete to participate in a masters programme in public policy analysis. This is a two-year programme involving one year of <Col N="1779"/>academic study followed by a year involving projects in public policy evaluation. Successful completion of the programme results in the award of a National University of Ireland accredited MSc Econ in public policy analysis. Officers who successful complete the programme will also be appointed to the grade of assistant principal officer. Following competitive interviews, one officer of this Department, a third secretary, was selected by the Department of Finance to participate in the programme and has successfully completed the first year of full-time academic study.</P>
        <P>The three other cases relate to attendance at the &Eacute;cole Nationale d&rsquo;Administration, &Eacute;NA in France under a scheme also operated by the Department of Finance. &Eacute;NA was established in 1945 as one of a number of fundamental reforms of the French Civil Service, with the purpose of selecting, training and developing future senior civil servants for positions throughout the public sector. Since 1964, the French authorities have reserved a number of places at &Eacute;NA for foreign students from public administrations throughout the world. Selection of foreign students for &Eacute;NA is on a competitive basis, with the final decision resting with the French authorities. The course provides an opportunity for Irish civil servants to gain first-hand experience of the work of the French public sector in a wide range of areas and to make contacts with existing and future senior French civil servants and with civil servants from more than 20 countries represented on the course. It also provides an opportunity to further develop French language skills.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?><P>The selection process for &Eacute;NA includes French oral and written examinations conducted by the Civil Service training and development centre at the Department of Finance. Selected candidates are then invited to attend for interview and an oral language test at the French Embassy in Dublin.</P> <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>Two officers of the Department were selected for, attended and successfully completed the course at the &Eacute;cole in the period in question. These were a third secretary, from September 2001 to March 2003 and an executive officer, from October 2002 to July 2003. A third officer, a third secretary, has been studying at the &Eacute;cole since September 2004 and will resume duty with the Department next March.</P>

	<P>One of the key objectives of the training and <Col N="1780"/>development strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to foster a culture of continuous learning within the Department to help staff develop the competencies necessary to perform to the best of their ability. In addition to the provision of classroom style and, in some cases, individualised training courses, the Department also operates a refund of fees scheme through which course fees relating to study by staff in their own time may be refunded in full. Such support is dependent on certain criteria. In particular, the course must be relevant to the officer&rsquo;s career in the Civil Service. To qualify for a refund under the scheme, the applicant must also complete the course and sit the relevant examinations.</P>
        <P>To date, 24 of the Department&rsquo;s staff have applied for refunds of fees in respect of courses being undertaken during the 2005-06 academic year. The total value of refunds in 2005 is expected to amount to about &euro;113,000, including final payments in respect of the 2004 to 2005 academic year. Two staff applied for prior approval to attend courses on a refund of fees basis in respect of the 2004 to 2005 academic year but did not subsequently apply for refunds.</P>

Departmental practice currently allows expenditure of up to a maximum of &euro;100 on any one briefcase.

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 468 to 470, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s position on Burma is clear. As I said on previous occasions, most recently in response to a series of parliamentary questions on 6 October, the Government&rsquo;s continuing goal, and that of the EU, remains the return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations, the release and restoration of liberty to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.</P>
        <P>The Government has consistently highlighted the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and condemned the lack of progress towards democracy. In my statement on behalf of Ireland at the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly on 19 September, I referred to the continuing denial of human rights and democracy in Burma. I stated that this was most acutely symbolised by the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and that her ordeal was not forgotten by the people of Ireland. I pointed out that the cumulative length of her detention is now very close to ten years. The Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who represented Ireland at the Asia-Europe Meeting, ASEM, of Foreign Ministers in Japan last May stated our position in the presence of representatives of the Burmese authorities. We also encourage Asian partners to use their influence to press the Burmese authorities on the situation there. As recently as last week, I availed of a meeting with Thailand&rsquo;s Deputy Prime Minister to raise our concerns.</P>
        <P>Last week also, my colleague in the Department, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met with a delegation from the National <Col N="1786"/>Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and associated groups accompanied by representatives of Burma Action Ireland. This meeting was part of a regular dialogue we have with those concerned with the situation in Burma.</P>
        <P>The EU applies sanctions against Burma, including a travel ban on senior members of the regime, which is referred to as the EU Common Position on Burma. The current common position is up for renewal in April 2006. In the absence of progress in the period ahead, the expectation is that measures will be renewed for a further year. There has been no discussion of the common position at EU level since the measures were renewed last April. It is expected that consideration of this issue will begin shortly, starting in the relevant working groups in Brussels.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any plans by the UN Security Council to consider the question of Burma. We would be pleased if this were to occur. Ireland will use relevant opportunities to press that the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s special representative, Mr. Razali Ismail, and the special rapporteur on the situation on human rights in Burma, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro, be allowed to visit and to meet all the key players in Burma.</P>
        <P>As regards funding, Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, funded an NGO project in 2003 entitled &lsquo;Burma: the funding of conflict and corruption through the unsustainable logging of Burma&rsquo;s forests&rsquo;, aimed at improving the prospects for the sustainable and equitable management of natural resources throughout Burma. Funding for this project amounted to &euro;81,629. In June of this year, DCI agreed to fund a three year project with another NGO. Total funding will amount to &euro;297,254. This project aims to ensure that women and young people from five Burmese ethnic minorities living along the Thai-Burma border possess the skills and knowledge to realise their rights, achieve democratisation and pursue reconciliation. Burma Action Ireland was also approved funding this year of &euro;7,685 to publish two reports documenting and raising awareness of human rights violations in Burma.</P>
        <P>Development Co-operation Ireland is open to receiving further appropriate funding requests from non-governmental organisations working to support human rights and democratisation in Burma. In addition, Tr&oacute;caire also received funding in 2004 from Development Co-operation Ireland of &euro;265,445 in support of its ongoing programme to strengthen civil society in Burma. Ireland pledged &euro;500,000 for humanitarian assistance in Burma in 2005 following the tsunami disaster in south east Asia in December 2004. This funding was allocated to the International Federation of the Red Cross and has been fully committed.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 473 to 477, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Ireland monitors the human rights situation in Haiti along with our partners in the European Union. In this context, Ireland supported the statement made by the European Union to the United Nations Security Council on 13 May 2005. This statement reiterates our concerns regarding the continuing human rights abuses in Haiti and calls on the Haitian national police to investigate thoroughly all allegations of human rights violations.</P>
        <P>In his report to the Security Council on 6 October 2005, the UN Secretary General highlighted the progressive improvements in the security environment in Haiti since his previous report in May. He reported on MINUSTAH&rsquo;s, United Nations Stabilization Mission to Haiti, assistance to the Haitian national police in the development of a reform plan aimed at enhancing professionalism and technical skills, but noted that respect for human rights of the Haitian population continued to be compromised by a mixture of criminal violence and institutional deficiencies. MINUSTAH was working to develop local capacities, including by training and <Col N="1789"/>advising local human rights organizations, while continuing to monitor human rights on the ground.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>The Secretary General has also reported that on 6 July 2005, MINUSTAH conducted a large-scale operation in the Cit&eacute; Soleil district of Port-au-Prince aimed at apprehending and bringing to justice a prominent gang leader. MINUSTAH encountered heavy gunfire, and while it took precautions to avoid civilian casualties, given the densely populated urban nature of the terrain, civilians appear to have been caught in the crossfire. However, reports of civilian casualties could not be verified by MINUSTAH due to the strength of the armed response from gang members, which forced MINUSTAH troops to withdraw from the area. Allegations were also made by the Haitian national police, and others, that gangs were seen killing civilians following the operation. MINUSTAH&rsquo;s joint special investigation unit is investigating these acts of reprisal, as well as allegations of excessive use of force by MINUSTAH. The prevailing fragile security situation in Cit&eacute; Soleil has complicated the investigation.</P>
        <P>With respect to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions in regard to the upcoming elections in Haiti, I can confirm that the EU has received an official invitation to send a delegation of observers to monitor the elections. The European Commission recently undertook an exploratory visit to Haiti in this connection and planning for the election observation mission is well underway and nominations are now being sought for observers. A memorandum of understanding concerning the EU election observation mission should be signed with the Haitian Transitional Government shortly. My Department will be nominating at least two individuals to participate in an EU mission.</P>
        <P>Recently, there have been reports of good progress in regard to the process of election registration, with 3 million out of a possible 4 million voters now registered. Nevertheless, I am aware that there have been a number of complaints in regard to decisions taken with respect to the organisation of the upcoming elections. The Haitian courts are investigating these complaints prior to the confirmation of a polling date. Ireland, along with its EU partners and the UN, fully supports efforts to ensure that free and fair elections take place. It is a matter for the Haitian authorities to decide whether former President Aristide should be permitted to participate in the elections.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the EU, fully supports the presence of the United Nations in Haiti and, as already mentioned, UN forces are playing a key role in facilitating the elections as well as improving the security environment there. MINUSTAH is working with local authorities to launch civic education programmes to prepare for the elections. It is also cooperating in demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration efforts. In <Col N="1790"/>June 2005, the Security Council extended MINUSTAH until February 2006 and approved a temporary increase in its strength in order to provide increased security in advance of the elections. The Security Council has also urged the Haitian authorities to increase and accelerate efforts to prepare for and ensure the smooth conduct of the elections, and called on international donors to provide the necessary resources to support the election process.</P>
        <P>At an EU-Latin American ministerial meeting which I attended in Luxembourg on 27 May 2005, the importance of comprehensive long-term aid to enable the Haitian people to work towards the establishment of a violence-free inclusive democratic system was acknowledged. The EU pledged &euro;294 million for comprehensive development projects in the country at the Washington Donor Conference for Haiti which took place in July 2004. The European Commission is taking the lead role in administering these funds, up to &euro;20.5 million of which is being used to support the election process.</P>

The requirement for such a deed is standard practice in regard to State funding and provides for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. The CSSO is currently in contact with the organisation&rsquo;s solicitors to progress the execution of the deed of covenant and charge, following which my Department will be in a position to progress payments to the organisation in question.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 493, 494 and 504 to 511, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The filling of the post in question was undertaken as part of a package of measures in the area of science co-ordination and oversight. In June 2004 the Government approved the putting in place of a Cabinet Sub-committee on Science, Technology and Innovation, STI, an interdepartmental committee for STI and the creation of the post in question &mdash; chief science adviser to the Government and the appointment of the current incumbent to it. The individual in question was returning from a position at director general level in the European Commission, having previously worked in a number of senior STI positions in the Irish public service.</P>
        <P>The post was filled on the basis of the availability of the individual concerned and his track record in the development of science policy and programmes at national and European level and was not the subject of advertisement or competition. The nature of the position is such that no formal qualifications have been stipulated with the key criterion being a broad background in science, technology and innovation. The individual in question supplied a curriculum vitae prior to appointment detailing his experience and academic background including details of his qualifications and experience at graduate and postgraduate level &mdash; BSc, MSc and PhD. Following its publication on 9 October 2005, I am aware of the media report referred to which has raised issues in respect of the individual&rsquo;s PhD and the awarding institution. I have had a discussion with the individual concerned and I am examining the issues further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In August 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Fahey, established an expert advisory group on workplace bullying, the terms of reference of which were to advise and report on the effectiveness of measures relating to the prevention of workplace bullying, the identification of improvements in procedures and how to address the contribution made by bullying to the incidence of workplace stress. In May 2005, I received the report of the expert group and on 17 August 2005, I launched the report, a copy of which is available free of charge on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.entemp.ie</i>. The principles laid down by the group in its report will underpin future consideration of the issue by the Government, as anything less is not acceptable in a fair, safe and equitable workplace. These principles are workplace bullying is unacceptable in all circumstances; it is the responsibility of management to ensure that bullying is not tolerated at the workplace; and that incidents of bulling are adequately dealt with and brought to a fair and conclusive resolution in a timely fashion.</P>
        <P>The group was chaired by Mr. Paul J. Farrell, partner at IBM&rsquo;s business consulting services and was widely representative of the social partners, the Health and Safety Authority, Equality Authority, Labour Relations Commission, National Centre for Partnership and Performance, anti-bullying centre at Trinity College Dublin, human resources practitioners, a solicitor and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The group determined that workplace bullying is an increasing problem. Whether this is due to an increase in the incidence of bullying or an increasing awareness of the unacceptability of bullying behaviour is not clearly demonstrable. However, the end result is the same &mdash; increased numbers of complaints; higher levels of work<Col N="1799"/>place stress; great frustration with a lack of formal channels for resolving such complaints; and an increased burden on all parties to resolve disputes; workplace bullying is not a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; industrial relations issue; existing measures to tackle the problem are insufficient; responsibility for tackling the problem is diffuse &mdash; clarity of process and resolution is required; and the impact of bullying on the individual is such that immediate action on the part of employers and the State is called for.</P>
        <P>The key recommendation of the group is legislation should be brought forward to deal with workplace bullying. This legislation should apply to all employees in the workforce, irrespective of employment status. In this regard, on 2 September 2005, as part of the follow up consultation process, my Department placed a notice in the national newspapers and on my Department&rsquo;s website seeking the views of interested parties on how the recommendations of the group might be implemented. A number of submissions have been received to date and they are being considered. I have also sought and obtained the views of the social partners and their views are also being considered.</P>
        <P>My Department will also shortly be implementing the group&rsquo;s recommendation to conduct a follow up survey on workplace bullying, which is similar to the survey conducted for the last report on this subject, published in 2001, to obtain an up-to-date picture of the incidence of the problem. When the views of the social partners and other interested parties have been considered and the results of the survey have been received, I intend to bring a report to Government for a decision on the way forward.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s code of practice for the prevention of workplace bullying 2002 and safety, health and welfare at work legislation refer to the employer&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of the his or her employees at work. The new Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which commenced on 1 September last, extends the employer&rsquo;s duty to managing and conducting work activities in such a way as to prevent, so far as is reasonably practicable, any improper conduct or behaviour likely to put the safety, health or welfare at work of his or her employees at risk. The duty on the employer in this new section of the Act is matched by a duty on employees in section 13(<i>e</i>) of the same Act not to engage in improper conduct or behaviour.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s anti-bullying unit is the focal point for dealing with requests for information and for the receipt of workplace complaints on bullying. It assists those employers who do not have an adequate anti-bullying policy, to upgrade what they have, and to bring it in line with the authority&rsquo;s code of practice for the prevention of workplace bullying.</P>

	<P>Planning of a ministerial trade mission from Ireland to the Ukraine is under way and it is hoped the timing of the mission, probably early 2006, will be finalised in the near future. This initiative follows a seminar organised by Enterprise Ireland in June last on doing business in the Ukraine which was extremely well attended. The proposed trade mission will act as focus for existing Irish interest in Ukraine and attract other Irish companies wishing to enter the Ukrainian market. The Ukraine is one of Europe&rsquo;s fastest growing economies and several sectors are especially interesting to Irish companies, for example, telecommunications, technology transfer, software, the food sector, healthcare, pharmaceuticals-medical devices, international consulting services, automotive components and aviation services.</P>

	<P>I have been informed that, in common with many other public bodies, Shannon Development employs external specialists to fulfil its internal audit function. Shannon Development uses the services of Deloitte (Limerick) to provide this function. The internal audit programme is agreed with the audit committee of Shannon Development and is approved by the full board. On occasion, Deloitte is also engaged to undertake specific assignments by the board that would not fall within the agreed internal audit programme.</P>
        <P>In the case of the sale of the former Burlington plant at Gillogue, County Clare, the board engaged Deloitte to review the process whereby the factory and adjacent lands at Gillogue were offered for sale. Following legal advice and concerns about a possible legal challenge the commission was cancelled and an alternative review process instituted. No report has issued on foot of this process. The day-to-day operation of Shannon Development is a matter for the board and management of the company. However, my Department has requested and received a number of updates from the company regarding the sale of the Gillogue property. In accordance with the relevant reporting obligations on State bodies the chairman of Shannon Development has confirmed to me that the Shannon Development has adopted and is complying with the Government&rsquo;s code of practice for corporate governance.</P>

However, a public consultation process, which I <Col N="1802"/>initiated following the consumer strategy group&rsquo;s recommendation that the groceries order should be revoked, recently generated more than 550 submissions.

The submissions have all been considered and a comprehensive report on the consultation process is currently being finalised within my Department. I expect that the report will include recommendations as to what action is appropriate in relation to the order. I will carefully consider my Department&rsquo;s findings before making any recommendations to Government.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the Competition Act is to prohibit anti-competitive practices by undertakings such as price fixing and-or the abuse of a dominant position. The Act applies to all sectors of the economy. An &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;. This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law. The view expressed by the Competition Authority in its investigation into price fixing involving the Equity trade union and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland was in respect of that particular case only. The parties to the investigation do not appear to have taken issue with the authority&rsquo;s view as they entered into undertakings with the authority in settlement of the case, thereby avoiding the necessity of going to court. Only the courts who can interpret the law. The authority&rsquo;s decision, which describes how it came to its view in the matter, is published on its website, <i>www.tca.ie</i>. The authority, in its decision, states that while it is perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective <Col N="1803"/>bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle cannot exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed contractors.</P>
        <P>In considering the question of whether an exemption from competition law should be provided for actors, musicians and freelance journalists, therefore, we need to bear in mind that a similar argument could be made for almost any group of self-employed contractors, such as barristers, farmers, publicans, doctors, pharmacists etc, who, by coming together, adding union to their name and getting a negotiating licence, could circumvent the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas under the Competition Act.</P>

	<P>The process of developing proposals for new regulations under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which came into operation on 1 September 2005, has commenced in respect of new general application regulations and new construction regulations.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is undertaking a public consultation process on the general application regulations. These proposed regulations will revoke and replace those provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 1993 &mdash; SI No. 44 of 2003, as amended &mdash; which were not incorporated in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and which were not revoked under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application)(Revocation) Regulations 2005, SI No. 392 of 2005.</P>
        <P>The proposed general application regulations will revoke and replace a range of existing regulations, including Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Signs) Regulations 1995, SI No. 132 of 1995; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Miscellaneous Welfare Provisions) Regulations 1995, SI No. 358 of 1995; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Children and Young Persons) Regulations 1998, SI No. 504 of 1998; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Night Work and Shift Work) Regulations 2000, SI No. 11 of 2000; Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Pregnant Employees, etc.) Regulations 2000, SI No. 218 of 2000; and Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) (Amendment) Regulations 2001, S.I. No. 188 of 2001.</P>
        <P>These regulations retranspose 11 EU directives and transpose for the first time the following EU directives relating to occupational safety, health and welfare: Directive 2001/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 amending Council Directive 89/655/EEC concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work, including work at height and Directive 2002/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents, vibration.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is also undertaking a parallel consultation exercise on draft safety, health and welfare at work (construction) regulations designed to revoke and replace the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001 and 2003. The <Col N="1805"/>proposed changes in those regulations fall within four main categories: the addition of requirements to make existing obligations more explicit and tangible; the reallocation of duties between duty holders to ensure clarity and achieve more effective and timely intervention by key persons; changes of a technical nature to the main body of the regulations; and the removal generally of provision relating to work at height and to lifting operations, which it is intended to cover in the proposed new general applications regulations and in proposed new lifting operations regulations respectively.</P>
        <P>Other replacement regulations for progression in 2006 include safety, health and welfare at work (quarries) regulations; safety, health and welfare at work (extractive industries) regulations; safety, health and welfare at work (mines) regulations; safety, health and welfare at work (carcinogens, mutagens, chemicals and biological agents) regulations; safety, health and welfare at work (fishing vessels) regulations; safety, health and welfare at work (noise) regulations, transposing Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council; safety, health and welfare at work (noise) regulations, transposing Directive 2003/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise); and safety, health and welfare at work (asbestos) regulations, transposing Directive 2003/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 March 2003 amending Council Directive 83/477/EEC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work.</P>
        <P>New regulations to be developed under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 include safety, health and welfare at work (diving) regulations and regulations relating to medical fitness to work under section 23 of the 2005 Act.</P>
        <P>It is intended that codes of practice and-or other appropriate guidance material will be produced in respect of the various regulations referred to above. I recently requested the chairman and board of the authority to bring forward proposals for regulations to implement the following: section 79 of the 2005 Act in respect of on-the-spot fines and section 13(1)(<i>c</i>) in regard to testing for intoxicants. I also asked the authority&rsquo;s board to consider appropriate ways to promote the concept of joint safety and health agreements between trade unions of employers and employees, as provided for under section 24 of the Act.</P>

	<P>The table that follows sets out the number of jobs created by agency supported companies in County Kildare in 2002, 2003 and 2004. These data are only compiled on an annual basis. As the requirement to notify the Department in advance of redundancies was replaced in early 2005 by a system of recording redundancies as they occur, the Department does not, as yet, have reliable figures for 2005 for such redundancies at county level.</P>
        <P>Overall permanent employment in agency supported firms in County Kildare has increased from 8,847 in 1995 to 15,698 in 2004, an increase of more than 75% which is significantly above than the national average. The most recent live register analysis from the Central Statistics Office &mdash; October 2005 &mdash; shows a reduction in the numbers on the live register in County Kildare, in the 12 month period ending September 2005, which indicates that job losses incurred in the county in that period have been more than offset by employment opportunities in other sectors.</P>
        <P>Over the past few years the enterprise support agencies under my Department have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to meet both the needs of society in terms of high quality employment opportunities and the needs of businesses that generate and sustain those jobs. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Kildare is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so the county can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment; encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment companies and third level institutions in the county; work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presence; provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county.</P>
        <P>Almost 60% of total employment in Kildare is in companies that are part of the technologically advanced sectors, compared to 45% nationally. While this development is welcome, new jobs are being created by established firms in the county. Green Isle Foods, for example, announced a major expansion earlier this year at its plant in Naas generating 130 new jobs. The services sector <Col N="1807"/>is the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy in County Kildare.</P>
        <P>County Kildare has benefited from significant investment in recent years in technological infrastructure in NUI Maynooth. This will be the key to ensuring that the county is an attractive location for knowledge-based industry in future years. Since 2002, Enterprise Ireland has approved more than &euro;3.3 million to support innovation partnerships between NUI Maynooth and industry. In addition to providing direct financial <Col N="1808"/>assistance, Kildare County Enterprise Board also provides indirect assistance such as advice, mentoring and a broad range of training programmes for prospective entrants or established participants in the micro-enterprise sector.</P>
        <P>Kildare continues to thrive across a broad range of activities in a number of important sectors; as a result, many job opportunities are being created within the county. I am confident the strategies and policies been pursued by the enterprise development agencies will continue to maximise sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Kildare.</P><Col N="1807"/>

	<P>In recent years there has been a substantial overall increase in apprentice registrations. In response to this challenge, my Department, through F&Aacute;S and in co-operation with the Department of Education and Science, increased the overall capacity of training places to meet this demand. Data on apprenticeship registration in the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 are set out in the table that follows.</P>
        <P>The phase 2 off-the-job training provision is funded by my Department and provided by F&Aacute;S. The provision for phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training courses is funded by the Department of <Col N="1808"/>Education and Science through the network of institutes of technology. The provision requirements for all of the respective off-the-job training courses are constantly under review. F&Aacute;S liaises with my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the institutes of technology on an ongoing basis to ensure adequate capacity is available for all of the off-the-job training courses. Ultimately, the provision requirements for phase 4 and phase 6 off-the-job training courses in IT colleges are at the discretion and resources of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>To address the falling number of apprentices being registered to the trades of printing, the national apprenticeship advisory committee, which advises the board of F&Aacute;S on all matters pertaining to apprenticeship and traineeship, recently endorsed the printing industry stakeholders&rsquo; request to convert the trades of printing to a three-year apprenticeship from a four-year apprenticeship. The industry stakeholders are reviewing the respective trades of printing curricula to ensure the curricula reflect the new three-year structure. </P><Col N="1807"/>

	<P>My Department uses the Blackberry as its PDA-type device of preference. This device gives selected officers of the Department the ability to keep up-to-date with their e-mail and appointments schedule while away from the office, while also providing mobile phone services.</P>
        <P>At present there are 83 of these devices in use in my Department and its associated offices, out of a total staff serving at end of September of 979.17. The device is normally only made available to officers at principal level and above; however, it can also be made available to other officers where there is a clear benefit to the Department. In such instances, a business case supported by the relevant assistant secretary is required before issue of a Blackberry. The current grade breakdown of those supplied with Blackberry devices is as follows:- Minister: 1, Secretary General: 1, Assistant Secretary: 7, Principal Officer: 24, Assistant Principal Officer: 13, Assistant. Sec/PO/AP equivalent grades: 10, Private Secretary: 3, Higher Executive Officer: 3, ODCA Inspectors: 20 and  Clerical Officer: 1. The cost of the Blackberry is currently around &euro;250 plus VAT per device, plus an ongoing monthly service charge of between &euro;30 and &euro;36 plus VAT, depending on the service provider. To avoid unnecessary equipment and line rental charges, officers are required to use the Blackberry device as their mobile phone. Prior to the move to the Blackberry, the dearest PDA purchased cost &euro;395 plus VAT.</P>

	<P>The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, in its annual competitiveness report 2005, found that of the 16 countries benchmarked, Irish expenditure on non-life insurance was the fourth highest. However, the NCC also found that the rate of growth in the cost of insurance has slowed down substantially in recent years. This can be attributed to the series of initiatives the Government has pushed through to reform the insurance sector. The action taken by Government to ensure healthy competition in the insurance sector had already seen benefits for consumers.</P>
        <P>The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, is one of the key initiatives of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme. The PIAB&rsquo;s first annual report shows that PIAB assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than under the litigation system.</P>
        <P>Supervision of insurance undertakings is the responsibility of the financial regulator, formerly known as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The financial regulator has a wide regulatory remit covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services industry, including insurance, and the services provided by it.</P>
        <P>It will be noted that the annual report of the financial regulator for the 2003-04 period highlights its role in addressing its mandate in the areas of consumer protection, the prudential supervision of financial service providers, including providers of insurance, and in establishing and building a new regulatory structure. Indeed the regulator&rsquo;s mission statement is &ldquo;to help consumers make informed financial decisions in a safe and fair market and to foster sound dynamic financial institutions in Ireland, thereby contributing to financial stability&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In addition, the regulator&rsquo;s strategic plan 2004-06, has identified two of its three high level goals in addressing its mandate as helping consumers to make informed choices through education and codes of practice in a fair financial services market&rdquo; and &ldquo;having a regulatory system that fosters safe and sound financial institutions while operating in a competitive and expanding market of high reputation&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1817"/>
        <P>Before the establishment of the Financial Regulator my Department regulated and supervised insurance undertakings. I had ministerial responsibility and my Department had access to detailed statutory returns which would have allowed my Department make judgments relating to levels of reserves and profits in insurance undertakings. The Financial Regulator now receives these statutory returns and has responsibility for protecting consumer interests in respect of insurance. The Financial Regulator comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, administered on behalf of my Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, a recipient of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment who has exceptional heating cost due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.</P>
        <P>Due to the different nature and format of applications for heating supplements, details of the number of applications to the executive for these supplements are not readily available in the north-eastern area or elsewhere. Details of the number of recipients of heating supplements in counties in the north-east area are shown in the following table.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the Family and Community Services Resource Centre, FRC, programme was transferred to the Family Support Agency on its establishment in May 2003. Applications to join the FRC programme then fell to be addressed by the newly established agency.</P>
        <P>The Ballyduff Family and Community Support Forum Limited&rsquo;s application to join the programme, originally submitted to the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 2001, was submitted to a sub-group of the Family Support Agency for consideration in 2004. The sub-group, established to assess such applications, decided at that time to postpone any decision until a regional support agency was in place covering the southern region. These support agencies play a vital role in the establishment of family resource centres by providing advice and support and by setting standards for their work.</P>
        <P>Following the award of a contract for the region to the south and mid-west Regional Support Agency in June 2005, the Family Support Agency asked them to meet Ballyduff Family and Community Support Forum Limited and to provide an update on the group&rsquo;s application.</P>
        <P>The application was re-submitted to the sub-group of the Family Support Agency for consideration earlier this month. The decision of the sub-group will be forwarded to the board of the agency for approval at their next meeting, which is scheduled for Monday 24 October. It will then be forwarded to me for final approval after which Ballyduff Family and Community Support Forum Limited will be notified of the decision in their case.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the parents of a single person living at home are subject to a means test when their child makes an application for unemployment assistance; his views on whether it is unfair to do so; if he will change this rule in any circumstance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[28611/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>For unemployment assistance purposes, the assessment of means for non-householders resident in the parental home has always taken into account the yearly value of any benefit and privilege enjoyed by him or her by virtue of residing with a parent or step-parent. In practice, this is taken to mean the value of free board and <Col N="1819"/>lodging to a claimant and such value is ascribed having regard to the level of parental income.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Social Welfare, 1986, examined the then operation of the benefit and privilege arrangements. The commission recommended the abolition of the concept of benefit and privilege for those aged 25 years and over. In reaching this conclusion, the commission stated: The reason for this cut-off point, 25, is that by that age young adults would normally have become financially independent of the parental home. The minority, however, unable to obtain employment by that age or those who become unemployed at a later age should also be entitled to financial independence and it can be argued that such persons should, therefore, be entitled to a payment in their own right, irrespective of parental means. Payment at the full basic rate is appropriate in such cases.</P>
        <P>In budget 2003, the assessment of benefit and privilege for UA claimants aged 29 years and over was abolished. Budget 2004 abolished the assessment for those aged 27 and 28 years of age. In budget 2005, I further reduced the age above which the assessment of benefit and privilege does not apply to 26 years of age. Any further change in these arrangements would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if he will increase the earnings threshold for the dependants of old age pensioners, contributory and non-contributory, from between &euro;88.88 and &euro;220.00 gross earnings per week to a range that is more reflective of the increase in the cost of living since this figure was last revised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[28763/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Across the majority of social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based, <i>inter alia</i>, on the spouse or partner&rsquo;s income. An increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse or partner&rsquo;s income is &euro;88.88 per week or less, with a reduced, or tapered rate payable where this income is between &euro;88.88 and &euro;220. This lower threshold of &euro;88.88 was last increased in budget 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then, from &euro;171.41, £135, in 2000 to &euro;220 in budget 2005.</P>
        <P>Since this Government came into office, a number of changes to these tapered arrangements have been introduced with a view to ensuring that the impact of increases in earnings are not negated for families where the spouse is the sole earner and is in low-paid employment. First, the range of income over which the IQA is withdrawn has been progressively extended. Second, provision was made for the deferral of the loss <Col N="1820"/>of half the child dependant allowance until the earnings of the spouse or partner exceeds the upper bound of the income range. Third, the IQA weekly rates have been increased annually in each budget package.</P>
        <P>One of the key objectives of the 2005 social welfare budget package was to protect and enhance the real value of all rates of payment. In this context, budget 2005 provided for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 8.4% to 13.1%.</P>
        <P>The main IQA rates were also increased by the same percentages thereby ensuring that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate. Thus, since the year 2000 the rate of IQA payable with old age, contributory, pension has increased by 56.3%, &euro;43.06, while the consumer price index has risen by 18.8%. Similarly, since 1995, the rate of IQA has increased by 95.7%, &euro;58.43, while the consumer price index has risen by 34.6%. This has given real increases of 31.6% and 45.4% respectively.</P>
        <P>Any change in the current arrangements relating to entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>if he will extend the benefits of the Class S PRSI contributions to enable those contributing to receive assistance such as disability benefit or invalidity pension during an illness; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[28766/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The social insurance system in Ireland is generally based on compulsory paid PRSI contributions on which entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments are established. Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors. Employees and their employers generally pay contributions at PRSI Class A, whereas self-employed workers generally pay Class S contributions. The class and number of contributions paid determines the range of benefits and pensions towards which contributors can build up entitlement.</P>
        <P>The range of benefits to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work and this is reflected in the rate of contributions payable. Self-employed individuals pay Class S contributions at a rate of 3% and are potentially eligible to a narrower range of benefits than employees who, together with their employers, are potentially liable for a total contribution of 14.05% under PRSI Class A. Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments: widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s contributory pension; orphan&rsquo;s contributory allowance; old age contributory pen<Col N="1821"/>sion; maternity benefit; adoptive benefit, and bereavement grant.</P>
        <P>When Class S was introduced for self-employed persons in 1988, coverage for both short-term insurance-based payments such as disability benefit and for illness was excluded on the grounds that it would prove administratively and legally complex and would be costly to implement.</P>
        <P>There are no immediate plans to extend short-term income support benefits or invalidity pensions to self-employed persons. Such an extension would not only necessitate a significant increase in the rate of Class S contribution to fund it but also require considerable changes to existing administration and control procedures. Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may claim supplementary welfare allowance, which is subject to a means test.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The basis for the restriction is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. It is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission wrote to the Government on 22 December 2004 raising a number of issues concerning its compliance with EU law in respect of workers and their families. Officials of my Department have engaged in discussion with the EU Commission officials, clarifying the operation of the condition and addressing the issues raised. In particular, it was pointed out that the question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with the criteria set out in European Court of Justice case law.</P>
        <P>These are: the length and continuity of residence in a particular country, length and purpose of absence from Ireland, nature and pattern of the employment, applicant&rsquo;s main centre of interest, future intention of applicant concerned as it appears from all the circumstances.</P>
        <P>In addition, full consideration is given in the decision making process to the requirements of EU Regulation 1408/71 which coordinates the social security rights of people who move within the EU. A response by the Commission to the points made is still awaited. It is expected that the <Col N="1822"/>Commission&rsquo;s examination of the matter will be concluded to the satisfaction of both parties by the end of this year.</P>

        <P>Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by deciding officers at local level throughout the country. Since 1 August 2005, decisions on child benefit cases are being dealt with in child benefit section in Letterkenny. At present decisions on complex cases for other scheme types are being made in the central unit.</P>
        <P>The main policy and administrative developments to date have included the drafting of guidelines, overseen by the Department&rsquo;s decisions advisory office, and the posting of these guidelines on the Department&rsquo;s website and on the Department&rsquo;s internal computer network for access by staff.</P><Col N="1824"/>
        <P>Administrative guidelines on the operation of the condition have also been compiled and furnished to staff in social welfare offices, social welfare scheme areas and the community welfare service. Training has also been provided to 1,300 departmental staff. The habitual residence condition is being operated in a considered manner, to ensure that people whose cases are appropriate to the Irish social welfare system have access to the system when they need it. In the period from May 2004 to 13 October a total of 22,810 cases has been decided. Almost 75% of these cases were found to satisfy the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. The purpose of the review is to assess the impact of the condition on different categories of claimants, the organisational arrangements and the level of service provided to customers, to identify opportunities for improvements in the administration of the scheme and identify emerging policy issues and consider how these should be addressed.</P>
        <P>Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in the area. I expect to be in a position to draw conclusions from the review by the end of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Regulation (EC) No 647/2005 came into force on 5 May 2005. The main element of the proposal concerns amendments to Article 4(2a) and Annex IIa of EEC Regulation 1408/71, details regarding special non-contributory cash benefits, to take account of new benefits of this type in national legislation and of developments in the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the classification of such benefits.</P>
        <P>Annex IIa of Regulation 1408/71 contains a list of special non-contributory benefits granted by member states to people exclusively within the territory of the member state in which they reside. In other words, they cannot be exported. The benefits in the annex were entered by each member state on the basis that they had <Col N="1825"/>characteristics of both social insurance and social assistance typically means tested payments.</P>
        <P>The European Court has ruled, Case C-215/99 Jauch and Case C-160/96 Molenaar, that for a benefit to be special it must be clear that it is neither a conventional social insurance nor a social assistance scheme; and have as its prime objective to react to the financial need of the persons concerned and guarantee them a minimum subsistence income, namely, it should be aimed at preventing poverty; or be exclusively designed to provide specific support for disabled people.</P>
        <P>In light of case law of the Court, the Commission considered it essential to review the list for each member state in order to ascertain whether the benefits listed meet the special and non-contributory criteria laid down by the Court. Annex IIa as a consequence has been amended to include only those benefits which satisfy the new definition as outlined by the Court, and reflected in Article 4(2a). Member states who wished to retain entries in Annex IIa were required to justify them by reference to the new definition.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland accepted that the eight entries listed in Annex IIa of Regulation 1408/71 would have to be removed in the light of the jurisprudence. Four of these entries come within the remit of the Department of Health and Children, and are: infectious diseases maintenance allowance, domiciliary care allowance, blind welfare allowance, and disabled person&rsquo;s rehabilitation allowance.</P>
        <P>Regarding the benefits outlined the Council decided that they should properly be reclassified as sickness benefits in cash, and should be coordinated by the rules relating to sickness benefits set out in Regulation 1408/71 which provides for export of benefits. In addition, and having regard to the jurisprudence of the Court, it was decided that carer&rsquo;s benefit, which is an insurance based payment, is properly classified a sickness benefit in cash within the meaning of Regulation 1408/71. This means that claimants of this benefit can rely to the extent necessary on periods of insurance completed in another member state in order to meet the PRSI contribution conditions. It also means that the benefit can be paid outside the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The remaining four entries removed from Annex IIa come within the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and are as follows: one parent family payment, family income supplement, orphan&rsquo;s non-contributory allowance, and carer&rsquo;s allowance Regarding the first three benefits outlined, the Council decided they should be coordinated as family benefits resulting in these benefits being exportable from Ireland in certain circumstances. Child benefit is already being coordinated as family benefit. In respect of carer&rsquo;s allowance it was agreed this benefit falls outside the scope of Regulation 1408/71 and thus, <Col N="1826"/>would continue to be paid only to recipients while resident in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Based on what I have said, the Irish entries that are maintained in Annex IIa with effect from 5 May 2005 are: unemployment assistance; old age and blind non-contributory pension; widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension; disability allowance; and mobility allowance While certain benefits are no longer listed in Annex IIa it does not mean that in all cases the benefits would be exported without restriction. For instance, child benefit as a family benefit is coordinated so that in the case, for example, of a family living in Northern Ireland with one parent working in the South, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is responsible for paying family benefits by virtue of the person&rsquo;s employment. If family benefits in Northern Ireland were higher that State would pay a supplement representing the difference in the two benefits. This ensures that the family gets the benefit of the highest rates of family benefits payable by the state of employment and the state of residence.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the payment of the fuel allowance to the tenants of Dublin City Council senior citizen flat schemes and flat schemes generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health service executive payments towards their additional heating needs during the winter season.</P>
        <P>As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowances are not payable in cases where a person has access to their own fuel supply, or is benefiting from a subsidised or low cost heating service, such as those provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes.</P>
        <P>In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, the Department recently ceased fuel allowance entitlement which had been paid in error in a number of cases where recipients were in local authority accommodation with subsidised or low cost heating.</P>
        <P>The allowances were withdrawn in these cases with effect from the start of the winter heating season and my Department will not be seeking repayment. The basis for this policy condition of the fuel allowance scheme is that the contribution that tenants in communal heating situations make towards their heating costs is limited to a fixed amount, typically around &euro;6 per week, included as part of their overall rent charge. Unlike other social welfare clients who must buy their own fuel at prevailing retail cost, these tenants are pro<Col N="1827"/>tected from increases in heating costs, the true cost of which is subsidised significantly by Dublin City Council and the other local authorities concerned. I have no plans at present to change the fuel allowance eligibility rules in such cases.</P>
        <P>More generally, the rates of fuel allowance payable and the season duration are under active review currently in my Department, particularly in view of the significant recent increases in domestic heating fuel prices. However, any change to the scheme would have very significant ongoing cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget, and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the launch of the Tallaght west childhood development initiative, to which the Deputy refers. The initiative aims to improve significantly the lives of disadvantaged children living in Tallaght west, who are amongst our most vulnerable citizens.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the initiative follows on from a study published last year entitled &lsquo;How are our Kids?&rsquo;, based on a sample of 187 children drawn from 79 households in Tallaght West. The study found that families and children in the area are at a much higher risk of poverty than the national average and that this is due to a combination of factors including: levels of unemployment more than twice the national average; a high proportion of children leaving school early; and almost one in three of households headed by a lone parent. In addition, the area has a much greater proportion of persons under the age of 25 than the national average.</P>
        <P>The childhood development initiative contains proposals across a range of policy areas including health, safety, education and child care. These proposals are designed to tackle the disadvantages experienced by young persons in the area and to increase their sense of community belonging.</P>
        <P>I met Dr. Katherine Zappone, project leader for the initiative, during her development of the plan and expressed my support for policies which would improve the lives of children living in west Tallaght. Persons living in such areas can experience multiple forms of disadvantage, whose resolution requires co-ordinated and joined-up activity <Col N="1828"/>across all areas of Government, together with co-operation from the local community.</P>
        <P>My Department is one of many public organisations providing services on the ground to persons in the Tallaght west area, designed to help unemployed persons to get into the work force and to provide income and other supports to those who are not in a position to work. In addition, the office for social inclusion, located in my Department, has responsibility for monitoring implementation of the national action against poverty and social exclusion. Eliminating child poverty is one of the key aims of the plan which contains a number of targets, across several policy areas, designed to break the cycle of disadvantage and exclusion experienced by certain children in society. Ending child poverty is also one of the special initiatives in the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently considering with other Departments and agencies how best to respond to the opportunity presented by the childhood development initiative, including how to make the most efficient use of the significant resources which are currently targeted at the area. It will be important in this regard to ensure synergy with the work of other co-ordinating mechanisms already operating in the community. I am confident that, by taking a Government-wide approach to this issue, and by working closely with the local community, we can deliver comprehensive and innovative policy responses which will make a major contribution to ensuring that vulnerable families and their children have a fair share of life chances and quality of life.</P>

	<P>My Department is committed to providing quality customer service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may include establishment of the customer&rsquo;s social insurance record, the provision of medical certificates of incapacity, verification of a customer&rsquo;s identity, satisfying residency conditions and an assessment of means where appropriate. In some cases there is an unavoidable time lag involved in making the necessary inquiries to enable decisions to be made. Time can also elapse <Col N="1829"/>through delays caused by applicants not supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim.</P>
        <P>On average, the current length of time taken to award claims for disability benefit is one week. Claims for unemployment benefit take from two to three weeks and unemployment assistance range from three to four weeks. Claims for invalidity pension take an average of nine to ten weeks to process and cases where the conditions of entitlement are more complex, such as in disability allowance, currently require between 13 and 14 weeks on average to finalise. Once a claim is decided, payment is normally made within one week, with arrears backdated to the application date of the claim.</P>
        <P>Improving customer service is a priority on my Department&rsquo;s agenda. The over-riding consideration in processing claims is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and decisions are not taken until all appropriate information is received. Customers who are in need of financial support while their claims are being processed can obtain supplementary welfare allowance during this period from local community welfare officers.</P>

        <P>There are no special on-call allowances or <i>ex-gratia</i> payments paid to staff working in my Department&rsquo;s press office.

        <P FLI="0">My Department has identified the issue of addressing and minimising absenteeism as one of the priorities within its human resources strategy. This is of vital importance in ensuring that the Department provides a high quality service to its customers. My Department has developed, through its partnership process and consultation with unions and staff associations, a comprehensive attendance management policy, aimed at addressing the issues arising in the context of sickness absence in an effective and balanced <Col N="1834"/>manner. The policy was circulated to all members of staff in June 2005.</P>
        <P>As a general rule, the cases of employees who have been on sick leave for approximately six to eight weeks are referred to the Office of the Chief Medical Officer for the Civil Service, CMO, for review. The CMO plays a crucial role in advising the Department on employees&rsquo; fitness for work from a medical perspective. In these situations, the employee is required to provide a detailed medical report for the CMO. In certain circumstances, the CMO may request the staff member to attend for medical examination.</P>
        <P>Long-term absences can increase the workloads of staff who have to provide cover for absent colleagues, particularly in areas that are working under considerable pressure. Under the attendance management policy, my Department is committed to dealing with such absences in a supportive manner and facilitating the return to work of employees as soon as possible, subject to medical approval. If necessary, a staff member may return to work, initially for a short period, on a reduced attendance basis. Generally, this is after a long-term absence and usually on the advice of the CMO. It must be recognised, however, as emphasised in the policy, that people who are ill should not be at work.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In addition, payments were made in respect of Reach, financed by the Information Society Fund, as follows: 2000, &euro;7,742; 2001, &euro;29,043; 2002, &euro;43,174; 2003, &euro;39,322; 2004, &euro;18,876; and 2005, &euro;22,152.</P>
        <P>The company is internationally recognised as one that provides vendor-independent detailed ICT industry expertise. It provides industry analysis and access to its analysts through a number of membership services. It has clients in every industry sector and is ideally placed to provide examples of international good practice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">General membership services provide my Department&rsquo;s information systems managers with access to independent reports and research papers on various aspects of new technologies and architectures. Executive Program membership further allows senior IT management in my Department to benefit from regular access to a designated highly qualified local consultant, unlimited access to analysts worldwide and specific guidance on enterprise level industry best practice as well as access to a network of senior IT organisations.</P>
        <P>Membership is through subscription services for which the normal public procurement tender process is not applicable. My Department has enrolled for membership at various levels over the years and the quality of the non-vendor specific material and data available has met its expectations. Given the scale and complexity of the Department&rsquo;s ICT, the budgets involved, and the long-term implications of decisions taken, it considers that this access to quality independent advice represents good value for money.</P>
        <P>My Department has also engaged the company on a small number of projects over the years. Information systems division organisational review: My Department engaged the company to carry out a resource review of its IS division in 2000 and to benchmark against similar organisations. The company was chosen as a result of a public procurement process, for which eight companies submitted tenders. I am satisfied that value <Col N="1836"/>for money was achieved because the report delivered on the requirements and expectations. Aspects of it have been implemented and it continues to inform ISD organisational policies.</P>
        <P>Information systems strategy: In 2004, the company was engaged to review and validate the information systems strategy, prepared by the Department&rsquo;s management team. The contract was placed in accordance with guidelines for single tender procurement. The review represented value for money because it confirmed the validity of the Department&rsquo;s approach to its future IS strategy, as well as highlighting gaps and informing the resolution of its strategic approach.</P>
        <P>Review of application integration architecture strategies: The company was asked to carry out an independent validation of the business case and the approaches to improving the quality of data interfaces between different types of computer applications, current and future. It was the only company requested to tender for this work because of the nature and relatively small size of the contract. It was chosen for its expertise in the research and analysis of emerging trends in the software market, including integration between current and future application platforms. Value for money was achieved because the review confirmed the business case and the range of approaches that needed to be considered for future developments, including integration of existing applications with the emerging service delivery modernisation programme.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Service delivery modernisation prototype: In October 1999, the Department held a competitive tendering exercise in which it invited proposals to <Col N="1836"/>prove the technical feasibility of building applications using a business object model approach. A flat fee of IEP £50,000, &euro;63,500, plus VAT was <Col N="1837"/>offered for each prototype. Following an evaluation process, three companies-consortiums were selected to develop suitable prototypes, one of which was led by the company in question. The prototypes were successfully delivered in the first half of 2000 and payment was made on 7 July 2000. Procurement was carried out in strict adherence to all relevant procurement legislation and resulting contracts were drawn up on a fixed price basis. I am satisfied that value for money has been achieved in this case.</P>
        <P>Information systems services management support: This contract was for programme, project and change management support. The procurement was carried out in accordance with national and EU procurement guidelines. The recommendation of the Department&rsquo;s evaluation group was submitted to and approved by the Government Contracts Committee.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s IS services area underwent a successful major reorganisation in that period and the consultancy support received played a significant role in that process. A major review of the Department&rsquo;s ICT infrastructure, to meet emerging needs and avail of new technologies, was carried out also and is currently being implemented. The advice received by my Department under this contract is considered to have delivered significant value for money.</P>
        <P>Civil registration modernisation programme: The civil registration modernisation programme was a joint programme of work between my Department and the Department of Health and Children, which implemented a modern civil registration service and provided a building block for the integration of related public services. The programme was overseen by a steering committee, drawn from a number of Departments and agencies.</P>
        <P>The public procurement exercise was carried out in accordance with EU and national procurement guidelines. The contract was awarded from 1 March 2001. The Department of Health and Children, as the owner of the implemented system, has been responsible for payments made since 2003.</P>
        <P>The civil registration modernisation programme and the consequent integration with the processing of child benefit claims has been recognised internationally as one of the finest examples of best practice in public administration in recent years. I am satisfied that the modernisation programme has resulted in the provision of a greatly enhanced service to the public, delivered on the wider e-Government agenda and represents excellent value for money.</P>
        <P>Reach: Payments to the company were made in respect of a technical architect, for advice on the design approach to the project and in respect of a contracted amount, &euro;15, 000 plus VAT, paid to a number of companies, including the company named, in respect of some of the overhead costs <Col N="1838"/>of preparing &lsquo;prototypes&rsquo; as part of the material to be submitted with their tender to build the public services broker.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the profit generated by National Toll Roads for operating the East Link and West Link facilities rose by 24% to &euro;26.1 million for the first half of 2005.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the 2005 interim results published in September by NTR plc. Those interim results indicate that the figure of &euro;26.1 million quoted by the Deputy is the amount of group revenue attributable to roads of a total group revenue of &euro;169 million for the first half of 2005. Group operating profit based on this revenue is declared at &euro;12.4 million. This profit figure is not broken down by sector and includes profits from other business areas.</P>
        <P>The tolling of the West Link bridge and agreements relating thereto are matters for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the toll operator, National Toll Roads, NTR. Issues relating to the operation of the East Link bridge are matters for Dublin City Council and NTR.</P>
        <P>Revenues accruing to NTR from the operation of the West Link bridge and the rate of return on the operator&rsquo;s investment are a function, <i>inter alia</i>, of the volume of traffic using the bridge and the operating costs of the concession. Traffic volumes have changed substantially since the agreement was concluded and the bridge opened to traffic. Traffic volumes and growth were substantially lower, both when the agreement was concluded and up to the mid-1990s, to what has transpired since the mid-1990s. The NRA is currently in negotiations with NTR regarding the upgrade of the West Link, including a move to barrier free tolling, as part of the overall plans to reduce congestion on the M50 through the upgrade of the full M50.</P>

	<P>The rail line to Maynooth was recently double tracked to enable the operation of a higher level of frequency along the line to service demand in the north Kildare and Fingal county areas. Since completing this network enhancement a number of new services have been added to the timetable from Maynooth and from Longford serving the town of Kilcock.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by Irish Rail that with the introduction of the new timetable in December it will be increasing service frequency on the Maynooth line in the morning and evening peaks. This will be another service enhancement for customers in the Kildare area.</P>
        <P>Service levels can and will continue to be increased, west of Maynooth, without double tracking the line. As population grows and demand changes, further consideration will be given to extending the double track section west of Maynooth but the priority for the short term will be on increasing service frequencies between Maynooth and the city centre where demand is greatest.</P>

	<P>There are currently 1,062 buses in the Dublin Bus fleet. The capacity of the fleet has increased by more than 25% at peak time under the NDP through the replacement of mini and single deck buses with higher capacity double deck buses.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus has purchased 497 new buses under the NDP, of which 93 are additional and 404 are replacement buses. The company has plans for further purchases this year.</P>

        <P>Dublin Bus is currently carrying out a review of the bus network in Dublin and future bus needs. I consider this appropriate given the significant changes in the greater Dublin area since 1999 when the NDP was drawn up.

	<P>In January 2005 I made regulations, the Road Traffic (Speed Limit-Traffic Signs) Regulations 2005, SI No. 10 of 2005, prescribing the regulatory traffic signs displaying metric units of measurement, km/h, that the road authorities must provide on public roads to indicate the speed limit in force. The range of traffic signs can be deployed to indicate that a default speed limit, a special speed limit or a road works speed limit is in force.</P>
        <P>While proposals for new formats of traffic signs are examined from time to time in my Department, the traffic sign regulations that I made in January of this year and the range of sign options already available under those regulations are adequate to support the implementation of any special speed limit options. The actual provision and installation of traffic signs on public roads is a matter for each road authority and advice is set out in the traffic signs manual in this regard. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in my earlier reply, to which the Deputy refers, the restructuring of the State Airports, including Shannon, is intended to enhance their regional focus and I am encouraged by the close co-operation between the new Shannon Airport <Col N="1844"/>Authority and the other regional development bodies in the area.</P>
        <P>There is work under way in my Department on a ten year transport investment framework which will address the future infrastructural requirements of the mid-west region. As the Deputy will also be aware, the restructuring of the State Airports, including Shannon, will be progressed in the light of the assessment in due course, by both myself and the Minister for Finance, of the business plans which are currently under preparation by the three airport authorities.</P>
        <P>As I have stated in previous replies, the development of an EU-US open skies regime provides many opportunities for Shannon Airport to contribute to the development of the mid-west. The liberalisation of the aviation market between the EU and US will mean more, not fewer, opportunities for Shannon to develop new routes into North America. This is because, at present, Irish airlines are restricted to only five cities in the US for normal scheduled services. However, the advent of open skies would mean that Irish or European airlines can fly into any airport in the US. The opening up of US airports to services from Ireland, for example, provides an opportunity for the development of Shannon as a hub for passengers or cargo coming from eastern Europe going onwards to the US. It is clearly a matter for Shannon airport to pursue these kinds of opportunities. However, without open skies, these opportunities simply will not exist.</P>
        <P>There is clearly pent up demand for service between Ireland and the US. Aer Lingus, for example, has been approached by several airports in the US with a view to beginning services. It will be a matter for Shannon airport to compete and to lobby Irish, European and US airlines to take advantage of this potentially huge increase in new services. This is the central thrust behind the Government&rsquo;s policy of making the State airports independent of each other so that they can compete with each other and therefore collectively provide the best and most optimal level of services for Ireland.</P>
        <P>The report the Deputy refers to concludes that an EU-US open skies agreement will be beneficial for Ireland, and that Irish business, tourism and aviation will all get a boost. The report is clear that Shannon will maintain links to the US but that it must improve its links to Dublin and Europe as a way of underpinning its US services. In that context, I am encouraged by the recent new services that are starting up from Shannon into Europe and the UK. The report mentions improving transport links around the west of Ireland, and this is being addressed in the ten year infrastructural plan that is being prepared.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that it has been the consistent policy of this Government that any change in transatlantic arrangements will be accompanied <Col N="1845"/>by an appropriate transitional arrangement to enable a smooth phasing in of open skies with the US in the future.</P>

	<P>The rural transport initiative, RTI, is a pilot programme that provides funding up to the end of 2006 for 34 rural community organisations to address the public transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department. ADM and the individual RTI project groups are solely responsible for all operational aspects of the initiative at project level. Neither my Department nor I have a role in such matters.</P>
        <P>While I have no specific information on south Kildare, I can tell the Deputy that an overall <Col N="1848"/>national appraisal of the RTI in 2004 found that it represented good value for money. It also found that, under it, over 300,000 passenger trips had been provided in 2003, with usage growing substantially during the course of 2004, and that 16,000 rural residents were benefiting from the programme.</P>
        <P>The appraisal found clear evidence of an improved quality of life for those availing of the services in that it promotes independent living, with improvements to the well-being and health of users.</P>
        <P>It makes a daily difference to the lives of thousands of citizens who otherwise would not have access to transport. Earlier this year I announced that, at the end of the pilot phase of the initiative in 2006, the RTI will be put on a permanent footing in 2007.</P>

	<P>Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys in the initial round of funding are a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. The board is an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. It engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf.</P>
        <P>I understand the process of assessing and approving applications has now been completed and the board has approved 521 projects totalling approximately &euro;63 million. The draw-down of funding is subject to the satisfactory completion of legal contracts between the individual groups and the board. As part of this process, groups are required to submit necessary documentation, such as agreed budgets, tax clearance certificates, evidence of insurance and so on, to ADM before payments are made. I understand that to date approximately &euro;7.2 million has been paid by ADM to groups approved for funding.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the new entrant or recent entrant category under the milk quota restructuring scheme is to encourage the assimilation of younger farmers into dairying in order to provide for the future development of the sector in circumstances where successors to existing dairy farmers are less available than heretofore. In common with other such schemes, it is necessary to establish criteria to limit the applicability of such measures so that their specific objectives are met. In this case, some 25% of the restructuring quota pool has been reserved for applicants under the age of 35 years.</P>
        <P>The scheme makes an important contribution to securing the commitment to dairying of the next generation of producers and complements other policies that seek to make careers in farming more attractive for younger farmers. Such policies are neither discriminatory nor unfair. Rather, they are targeted measures that indirectly benefit the farming sector by supporting its future development. They are necessary incentives to maintaining the commitment of young trained farmers in the sector against the competing and expanding range of alternative opportunities for <Col N="1885"/>them outside of farming. The policy of providing specific incentives to young farmers has the support of all farm organisations.</P>

	<P>An application under the disadvantaged areas scheme was received from the person named on 10 May 2005. Following computer validation, it was found that one parcel which had been included by the person named on his application had also been included on the application of another scheme applicant.</P>
        <P>The person named was written to on 1 September 2005 and asked to confirm his right to claim the parcel in question or otherwise. If claiming the right to this parcel, the person named was requested to provide a copy of Land Registry deeds, or a copy of a lease or rental agreement, that clearly shows entitlement to this parcel. In response, by letter received 7 September 2005, the person named confirmed that he was not entitled to claim the parcel in question. The application of the person named is now being processed further by my Department.</P>

	<P>An application under the disadvantaged areas scheme was received from the person in question on 14 April 2005. Follow<Col N="1886"/>ing computer validation, it was found that two land parcels, which had been claimed by the person in question, were also the subject of a claim by another scheme applicant. The person in question was, therefore, written to on 7 September 2005 and asked to confirm his right to claim the parcels in question, or otherwise. If claiming the right to these parcels, the person named was requested to provide a copy of Land Registry deeds, or a copy of a lease or rental agreement, that clearly shows his entitlement to these parcels. While a reply was received from the person in question on 15 September 2005, the reply was incomplete in that it did not confirm entitlement to claim one of the parcels concerned, nor were any of the documents sought from the person named provided. Accordingly, the person named has again been written to, asking that the questions raised be specifically addressed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The forest service of the Department of Agriculture and Food operates a public consultation procedure for afforestation proposals in environmentally sensitive areas, as defined under the European Communities Environmental Impact Assessment (Amendment) Regulations, SI 538 of 2001. Observations and objections from prescribed bodies and from members of the public are invited and assessed. If, following assessment, it is decided to approve the proposed afforestation, each of the parties who objected originally is notified in writing of the decision to proceed. Appeals against that decision must be lodged within 21 days of receipt of the notification from the forest service.</P>
        <P>All appeals must be made in writing, setting out the grounds of appeal and addressed to the appeal unit, forest service, the Department of Agriculture and Food, Johnstown Castle Estate, County Wexford.</P>

	<P>The appeals procedure is handled by an administrative unit of the forest service. The unit is staffed by one higher executive officer, 50% of time and one clerical officer. The appeals committee comprises a senior inspector and an assistant principal officer.</P>
        <P>The unit deals with two main categories of appellants. There are applicants whose proposals for afforestation have either been rejected or modified, or who are dissatisfied with any decision made in their entitlements under the forestry grant and premium schemes. There are third parties who, having previously been consulted, object to a subsequent decision to approve afforestation in certain areas. The majority of appeals fall into the first category.</P>
        <P>Eight appeals against decisions to approve afforestation have been considered. The grounds for objection include a range of issues, such as environmental, amenity, economic and ecological concerns. The following table provides details of the appeals to-date against decisions to approve such afforestation projects.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The person named was not an applicant under the livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes during 2000 to 2002 or earlier during 1997 to 1999. Consequently, no entitlements under the single payment scheme have been established for the person named. The Department of Agriculture and Food does have a record of an application from the person named for consolidation of entitlements. However, since there are no entitlements established it is not possible to consolidate. My officials have been in contact with the person in question on the submission of a 2005 single payment scheme application form.</P>
        <P>The person named submitted an application to the 2005 single payment scheme national reserve <Col N="1889"/>under category D which caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year. Applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received from over 17,500 farmers. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants by 1 December next. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed.</P>

        <P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, including silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market, or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the <Col N="1895"/>waste in question.

My Department has no involvement in the running of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Participants in REPS are required to avail of a recycling collection facility, such as the IFFPG scheme, where one exists, and to store such waste plastics neatly and safely on the farm pending disposal.

In 2002, The company was asked to provide expertise to build a multi-project method of secure access to systems within DAF. This was to be built upon their own security modules.
	         </entry>
                <entry>
As The company had provided the technical framework for the J2EE environment and had prepared the technical architecture design for that environment, they were commissioned to undertake the building of a system to provide secure access for all our staff to all new IT systems with the flexibility to move seamlessly and efficiently between these systems. This was a force majeure measure as other projects were being delayed, with potential cost implications, due to the lack of such a secure access facility and issues had been raised during EU certification audit. Also, the essential skills and expertise were not available within the Department and the underlying environment had been designed and built by the company.

                <entry>
The Department now had a secure method of access to all systems for its internal staff. The system was now capable of handling multi-application access. This meant less coding and time savings for future developers. This increased security had been an essential requirement which had been identified by the certifying body during part of the annual accreditation audit of the Department as an EU paying agency

	<P>Following confirmation of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in cattle and pigs on a farm in the Eldorado district of Mato Grosso do Sul in the southern part of Brazil, the European Commission presented a proposal on 12 October to suspend imports of de-boned and matured beef from the regions of Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, and also Sao Paulo.</P>
        <P>The Commission extended the scope of the measure to include the region of Sao Paulo on the basis of concerns in relation to the possible movement of animals from the area where the outbreak occurred. The proposal was adopted at a meeting of the standing committee on the food chain and animal health at which my Department is represented. Accordingly beef produced in the affected regions from cattle slaughtered since 29 September 2005 may not now be traded. The measures have immediate effect throughout the EU and are being applied to direct imports of beef by my Department&rsquo;s approved border inspection posts.</P>

        <P>The system will be extended nationwide in respect of existing penalty point offences in conjunction with the commencement of an outsourced fixed charge payment collection service. Subject to finalisation of contract negotiations between the Department and the preferred service provider, rollout will commence later this year.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is proposed to roll out additional penalty point offences under regulations under the Road Traffic Act 2002 which will be prepared by the Department of Transport in consultation with my Department.</P>

	<P>First not all travellers to the State require a visa. The list of states whose citizens do not require an Irish visa is contained in Schedule 1 of the Immigration Act (Visas) Order 2005. All other nationals must be in possession of a valid Irish visa each time they travel to the State.</P>
        <P>The granting of an Irish visa is, in effect, only a form of pre-entry clearance enabling a visa-required national to travel to the State for the specific purpose stated. A visa does not grant permission to enter the State and visa holders are subject to normal immigration control at the port of entry. The actual permission to enter the State is given by the immigration officer at the port of entry who will also indicate the duration of stay permitted.</P>
        <P>Irish visas are sought for a wide variety of purposes, such as holidays, a visit, business, conference, employment, exam, interview, to join family, medical reasons, sports tournaments, study, training, etc. The period of validity of an Irish visa, i.e. the time during which it can be used to travel to the State, is generally three months, <Col N="1914"/>but this may be reduced or increased having regard to circumstances of particular cases.</P>
        <P>There are two types of visa: a C visa, where the traveller is proposing to remain in the State for a maximum period of up to three months and a D visa, where the traveller is proposing to remain for extended periods over three months. The stated purpose of journey will be indicated on the visa.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Applications for visas must normally be made through the Irish embassy or consulate in the applicant&rsquo;s country of permanent residence or, if there is no embassy or consulate, through the applicant&rsquo;s reference in Ireland or direct by post to the visa office of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The question of visa fees is a matter for that Department and I understand its current fees are: single journey visa, &euro;60; multiple journey visa, &euro;100; and transit visa, &euro;25.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Foreign Affairs has been given delegated sanction to approve visas in a wide variety of circumstances and in fact the vast majority of visa applications are approved under this delegated sanction without reference to my Department. Applications not within the delegated sanction are referred to my Department for processing. The actual issuing of the visas, that is, the affixing of the visa sticker into the passport of the prospective traveller, is the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am informed that the number of visas issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs over recent years is as follows; 104,900 in 2002; 120,200 in 2003; 113,550 in 2004; and 104,100 to date in 2005. These visas are issued by the extensive network of Irish embassies and consulates around the world. The Department of Foreign Affairs is not in a position to provide a breakdown of the variety of visas issued.</P>
        <P>Access to employment in the State by non-nationals comes under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A national of a country outside the European Economic Area who wishes to come to Ireland to work requires the authorisation of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, normally a work permit. There is however a concession whereby non-national students registered as attending a course of study leading to a qualification recognised by the Department of Education and Science, a list of which courses is available on <i>www.education.ie,</i> can enter part-time casual employment, defined as up to 20 hours per week or full-time work during normal college vacation periods.</P>

A visa does not grant permission to enter the State and visa holders are subject to normal immigration control at the port of entry. The actual permission to enter the State is given by the immigration officer at the port of entry who will also indicate the duration of stay permitted.</P>
        <P>The type of visa as referred to by the Deputy enables the holder to travel to the frontiers of the State and to seek permission to enter and reside in the State on the basis indicated on the visa, that is, to join his or her spouse. The term D visa indicates to the immigration authorities that the visit is not short term in nature. The endorsement &ldquo;Bearer Only&rdquo; indicates that the visa is valid for the passport holder only and does not cover any persons travelling with the holder.</P>
        <P>A single journey visa is valid for one journey to the State. Should the holder subsequently wish to depart the State and return on a later date they will require a re-entry visa. A re-entry visa can be obtained prior to departing the State from the visa office of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.</P>

	<P>I established the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime in March 2005 with a remit to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and disburse funding for victim support measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission&rsquo;s term of office is for three years and its members are Mr. Jim Mc Hugh, retired assistant commissioner &mdash;chairman, Ms Nora Owen, former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Sean Lowry, former head of the probation and welfare service, Mr. Michael Whelan, Gemini Consulting and Ms Marian Finucane, broadcaster.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s remit includes the examination of all aspects of the provision of services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system. These provisions are currently set out in the victims charter which was last updated in 1999.</P>
        <P>In addition, the commission will supervise the disbursement of funds to community and other voluntary groups providing victim services, with a particular emphasis on the funding of activities on the ground that provide direct supports for victims of crime. I am advised that the commission has received over 60 applications for funding for measures to support victims of crime <Col N="1917"/>in response to a public advertisement earlier this year. The commission examines each application on its merits and makes an independent decision in relation to eligibility for funding. I understand that these included independent applications from a number of former elements of the Victim Support organisation including a group of ten branches that have formed a new federation for victim assistance, as well as the interim board of victim support. It should be noted that I decided to terminate funding for the Victim Support organisation with effect from 31 March 2005 because of reductions in service levels and concerns in relation to governance, accountability and value for money arising from ongoing internal difficulties in that organisation and because an independent review, carried out early in 2005, concluded that the organisation was terminally damaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand that the commission has arranged to meet the interim board of Victim Support today, 18 October, in order to discuss their application for funding. As with every other group considered for funding, the commission will have to be satisfied in regard to governance, accountability and value for money issues in coming to its decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy may be interested to note that the commission has already agreed to make funding available to the national crime victims helpline, a single lo-call number manned by volunteers and providing information on all services available to victims of crime, the Rape Crisis Network; the Women&rsquo;s Aid Dublin, the Irish Tourist Advisory Service, the Support after Homicide Group, Advic &mdash; a new organisation providing advocacy for families of homicide victims &mdash; the Court Support Service, which provides impartial practical support for victims and witnesses in court proceedings; Muintir na T&iacute;re, follow-up support to elderly rural crime victims, ICPAC, the Irish centre for parentally abducted children and CARI, services to child abuse victims.</P>

The personnel strength of Glanmire Garda <Col N="1918"/>station as at 1 January 1998 was 14, all ranks. This represents an increase of three, or 21%, in the number of personnel allocated to Glanmire Garda station.</P>
        <P>Glanmire Garda station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday. It also opens from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sundays. A new 24-hour mobile patrol system was introduced at the station in March 2005.</P>
        <P>The extension of the opening hours at Glanmire would only serve to confine additional personnel to indoor duties and it is the view of the Garda authorities that such personnel would be deployed more usefully on the beat.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I assume that the Deputy is requesting the total number of visas issued to Nigerian nationals over the past two years. Under a scheme known as delegated sanction, the Department of Foreign Affairs issues the vast majority of visas without reference to my Department. These visas fall into a limited number of categories and in general are cases where the application is straightforward and there is no appreciable immigration risk. Less straightforward cases are referred to my Department for decision. In addition, my Department operates dedicated visa offices in Moscow and Beijing which have the authority to decide all visa applications received in those offices.</P>
        <P>The visa system by its very nature is widely distributed around the world. While each Irish mission throughout the globe maintains its own records of visas issued, and is required to submit these records on a regular basis to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin, there is not any central method for storing the type of specific statistical data requested by the Deputy. Consequently it is not possible to provide a total figure for all visas issued to Nigerian nationals in all locations throughout the world. However, out of the total number of applications processed by the visa offices of my Department in Dublin, Moscow and Beijing, 677 visas were approved for Nigerian nationals in 2004; 466 visas have been approved to date in 2005 for Nigerian nationals, in the three locations. For the same reasons as outlined above it is not possible to break down the figures above for 2004 into the different types of visas applied for.</P>
        <P>Since the start of 2005 however, my Department has introduced an interim system to produce limited statistical information for visa related matters. Based on the information available, the top five types of visas that have issued to Nigerian nationals to date in 2005, by the Dublin, Moscow and Beijing offices of my Department are as follows: visit, with 141 issued; join spouse, with 68 issued; join parent, with 64 issued; study, <Col N="1920"/>with 51 issued; re-entry, with 40 issued. All others amounted to 102. These figures do not include those visas issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs under the delegated sanction scheme.</P>

        <Quest>the number of complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning discriminatory treatment; the decisions adopted; and the efforts he has made and will make to intensify sensitisation efforts among members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</Quest>

	<P>I have been informed that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board when recording complaints received categorises such complaints under the headings provided for in the fourth schedule of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Complaints) Act 1986. These are abuse of authority; discourtesy; neglect of duty; falsehood or prevarication; corrupt or improper practice; misuse of money or property; intoxication; discreditable conduct; and accessory to conduct specified above.</P>
        <P>Accordingly the board, in its annual reports, categorises breaches of discipline under these headings rather than the category indicated in the question from the Deputy. The annual reports also detail the outcome of complaints and the disciplinary action recommended. These reports are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and are also available on the web site of the complaints board at <i>www.gscb.ie/publications</i>. I am assured by the Garda authorities that they make every effort to ensure that members of the public are treated properly by the Garda. Abuse in any form is not tolerated and indeed all members are subject to the force&rsquo;s disciplinary code.</P>
        <P>Training in the area of discrimination and discriminatory treatment is handled at a number of levels in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In respect of students and new graduates, the subject is dealt with on the curriculum and forms an integral part of the social and psychological and contextual policing studies area. During experiential learning periods, students are also exposed to best practices in this area under the supervision of divisional training staff. Training on issues of discrimination and discriminatory treatment are included on supervisory development programmes for sergeants, inspectors, superintendents and chief superintendents. This includes development modules on human rights training, policing a multicultural society and professional values and ethical standards.</P>
        <P>In addition, the continuous professional development core programme for 2005 contains training modules on human rights, code of ethics, <Col N="1921"/>racism and awareness of mental illness. The 2006 programme which is currently in the final stages of preparation will also contain modules dealing with the victims of rape and sexual assault, liaising with the families of victims of homicide as well as dealing with aged persons.</P>

	<P>CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing, and which cover areas to which the public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two distinct categories: Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems. Garda CCTV and community-based CCTV systems are funded directly from a provision within the Garda Vote. Finance for Garda CCTV systems is allocated each year in the Estimates process, with the amount sought being based on current and planned Garda projects. In addition to the Garda CCTV systems in Dublin, Cork and Tralee a further 17 locations nationwide were selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme of implementation of CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1 in Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; phase 3 in Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. Phase 1 has been completed in five of the six locations.</P>
        <P>Installation of CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible <Col N="1924"/>the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. I have asked the commissioner to submit proposals for outsourced CCTV systems in the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006. The Garda authorities are now finalising their proposals in consultation with my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to install Garda CCTV systems in all areas that have sought them. To this end, I launched the community-based CCTV scheme on 15 June 2005. This scheme has been developed in response to a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of CCTV systems. The scheme is designed to provide financial assistance to qualifying local organisations towards meeting the capital costs associated with the establishment of local community CCTV systems. Communities which are not ready to apply for full scheme funding, stage 2, could apply for pre-development supports, stage 1, to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals which will have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of applications was 20 September 2005 and the scheme is being administered on behalf of my Department by Area Development Management Limited, ADM. I am informed by ADM that a total of 83 applications for funding under the community-based CCTV scheme, with 51 under stage 1 and 32 under stage 2, received by the closing date. The process of evaluation and assessment of applications is underway and recommendations will be made, by ADM, to my Department&rsquo;s community-based CCTV project board in due course. It is intended to invite a new round of applications for funding under the scheme early next year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of funding for neighbourhood watch organisations, I am strongly of the view that voluntary community organisations have, through their support for and work with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an important role to play in crime prevention and the promotion of community safety. I very much support the work being carried out by neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes throughout the country. Discussions are under way on a number of issues regarding neighbourhood watch, in the context of which the issue of funding for the groups is being considered.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware the term &ldquo;pre-school&rdquo; or &ldquo;cr&egrave;che&rdquo; describes a wide range of services, only some of which would be in receipt of funding under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, for which my Department has responsibility. It is not possible, therefore, for me to give a comprehensive response to this question.</P>
        <P>Both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science have interaction with cr&egrave;che and pre-school services. The Department of Health and Children has responsibility for the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996, under which a notification requirement is placed on certain child care services for children aged under six years. I understand that at the end of 2004, more than 3,000 such services had been notified to the Health Service Executive under the provisions of the regulations. A number of other such services would come within the scope of the Early Start, Rutland Street and Travellers&rsquo; pre-schools projects, administered and directly funded by the Department of Education and Science. These services are provided to assist the care and development of children from disadvantaged communities. In the Department&rsquo;s recently published action plan for educational inclusion, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, indicated that the focus of early education under her remit will be on children between three years and schoolgoing age and who are subsequently to be enrolled in schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</P>
        <P>With regard to my Department&rsquo;s role in this area, the EOCP provides grant aid, both capital and staffing, to child care services which support parents to access employment, education or training. These services would include cr&eacute;che and pre-school services. Under the programme, support for staffing costs is only made available to voluntary and community groups which can demonstrate a strong focus on disadvantage. Approximately 750 such groups receive funding under the programme usually for a period of three years. The period of funding was extended recently to the end of 2007 for a number of qualifying groups which had come to the end of their three-year cycle of funding. I understand that to the end of June 2005 more than &euro;97 million had been expended in staffing grants by beneficiaries under the programme. This funding was responsible for supporting approximately 2,300 child care staff, of which 992 were in full time positions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 655 and 663 together.</P>
        <P>As regards allegations that some solicitors have double charged in respect of applications to the Residential Institutions Redress Board, I wish to put on record my abhorrence of any such double charging. I understand that the Law Society has put in place special additional measures, including a helpline, to facilitate the making of complaints in these cases. The solicitors&rsquo; profession is regulated by the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2002 and there are a number of measures in place to deal with these complaints and complaints generally against solicitors. There are two committees which consider complaints against solicitors, the complaints and client relations committee, formerly known as the registrar&rsquo;s committee, of the Law Society of Ireland and the disciplinary tribunal which is appointed by the President of the High Court under section 16 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994. The tribunal examines allegations of misconduct by solicitors and reports to the High Court. The complaints and client relations committee, which includes lay members, may itself determine complaints lodged directly to it by members of the public.</P>
        <P>The disciplinary regime for solicitors was strengthened in a number of respects by the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002. The Act doubled the size of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases; required the tribunal to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct and have regard to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in a current case; increased from £5,000 to £15,000 the maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society&rsquo;s compensation fund; provided a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects <Col N="1927"/>of the tribunal&rsquo;s work; and provided for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations. In addition, the circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail and the circumstances in which it can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor&rsquo;s office are extended.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
        <P>A member of the public who is dissatisfied with how the Law Society handles a complaint made to it may refer the matter to the adjudicator appointed under the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations 1997. The adjudicator can require the production of documents and make conclusions of fact and recommendations. She or he may direct the society to re-examine or re-investigate the related complaint made to it about a solicitor where she or he is not satisfied that the society has investigated the complaint adequately. She or he may also direct the society to make an application to the disciplinary tribunal for an inquiry into the conduct of the solicitor on the ground of alleged misconduct. The current independent adjudicator is Ms Leore Mrkwicka and her address for correspondence is 26-27, Upper Pembroke Street, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>A barrier to the investigation of complaints against solicitors in cases where the <i>in camera</i> rule applied has been addressed by section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004. The prohibition on furnishing documents, information and evidence to bodies, including the Law Society, when they are conducting inquiries etc., has been lifted, subject to certain safeguards. The bodies concerned will have to conduct their hearings otherwise than in public and no document, information or evidence shall be published. Section 40, in so far as it relates to investigations by the Law Society of complaints against solicitors, came into operation in July 2004 and it also applies to proceedings prior to that date.</P>
        <P>With a view to further strengthening the mechanisms for dealing with complaint against the legal profession and to having a system in place which is both independent and seen to be independent, I am in the course of devising proposals for submission to Government to set up on a statutory basis a legal services ombudsman to oversee the handling of complaints against both solicitors and barristers. The details are being worked out at present and it is intended that provision for the legal services ombudsman will be made in a Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which is in the course of being drafted for publication as early as possible next year.</P>
        <P>I am also making provision in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill for implementation of recommendations, made in a report last <Col N="1928"/>year by the regulatory review task force of the Law Society which require amendment of existing statutory provisions. I am providing for the amendment of section 8 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 to allow the award to a complainant of compensation of up to &euro;3,000, with indexation, in restitution for losses suffered as a consequence of inadequate services by a solicitor. Such payment will be without prejudice to the legal right of the client and will be in addition to the existing power whereby a solicitor can be directed to refund wholly or in part costs already paid by the client or to waive costs or to take other rectification measures. I am also providing for the repeal, in the case of the Law Society&rsquo;s regulatory committees, of the statutory requirement that at least two-thirds of the membership of these committees and of any quorum of such committees should be members of the council. This will facilitate an increase in the number of lay members and contribute to the separation of the regulatory function form the representational function of the Law Society. The changes are in addition to those recommendations of its regulatory review task force which do not require primary legislation, which the Law Society proposes to implement.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A group which I set up last year to identify ways of reducing legal costs in civil litigation is due to report to me very shortly. While the recommendations of the group cannot be anticipated, it is very likely that its recommendations will have relevance in addressing issues such as the alleged overcharging by solicitors.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am very much aware of the dangers posed by the use of illegal fireworks and of the distress they cause to people, particularly at this time of year. Consequently, last February I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the Explosives Act 1875 which governs fireworks. It is already clear from the submissions received to date that among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before <Col N="1929"/>the House, to bring forward on Committee Stage of that Bill amendments which will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to increase significantly penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>The Garda authorities make every effort to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks. Where necessary specific policing plans are put in place in areas where particular problems arise. These plans include intelligence gathering on known dealers and suppliers and once identified putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks. Each year leading up to Hallow&rsquo;een special efforts are made to combat the illegal importation of fireworks. This year an intelligence-led operation called Operation Tombola, which aims to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner. In this context chief superintendents throughout the country have been instructed to introduce measures appropriate to their respective areas of responsibility, with particular emphasis on Garda divisions in the Dublin metropolitan region and in border regions. The operation, while being intelligence driven, is coupled with appropriate high visibility policing activities.</P>

	<P>Some minor security works are under way at present aimed mainly at securing the property and preventing unauthorised access onto the site. I can also confirm that the removal of three trees near the house which was carried out for safety reasons did not require a tree felling licence and that no breaches of the planning laws or regulations have occurred arising from the various works carried out to date. As the work is still ongoing the precise costs involved are not yet available.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the specific statistics sought by the Deputy for the period in question are not available. However, I can inform her that 211,928 speeding offences were detected in 2004. These figures are provisional and liable to change.</P>
        <P>It is envisaged that by the completion of the period of the road safety strategy 2004 to 2006, at least 50% of the overall vehicle fleet will pass through a speed check each month. This target is based primarily on the deployment of additional enforcement assets through the engagement of private sector concerns for the purpose of the operation of a nationwide programme for the detection of speeding offences. The Deputy will be aware that, in July this year, the Government gave approval to outsource and privatise the installation and operation of speed cameras. Legislation to allow for this is being drafted by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, and the Garda authorities inform me that they have commenced preparatory work with regard to the tendering process.</P>

        <Quest> further to Questions Nos. 366 of 29 June 2005 and 388 of 11 October 2005, the information for 1997, 1998 and 1999 as requested, has not been received.</Quest>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following tables show the indictable offences, by group, for the Garda districts of Bray, which includes the Greystones area; Gorey, which includes the Arklow area; Wicklow and Baltinglass, which includes the Blessington area, for the years 1997 to 1998.</P>
        <P>In interpreting these figures, account has to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. These new groups are more comprehensive and not comparable to the four crime groups previously used. For this reason the figures for 1997 and 1998 are not comparable to statistics provided for the years 2000 onwards.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that the number of indictable offences by group for a full year at the level of Garda district are not available for 1999. </P><Col N="1931"/>

	<P>An application for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, was submitted by this <Col N="1933"/>group to my Department some time ago. The capital grant application was forwarded to Area Development Management Limited, which is engaged by my Department to carry out detailed assessments of all EOCP grant applications. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment by ADM to ensure it meets the EOCP funding criteria. In addition, large scale projects such as this capital development undergo an intensive assessment by an external building consultant. While this process necessarily takes some time, every effort is made to conclude assessments as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>When the assessment on the project in question is completed, the application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before a final decision is made regarding funding. The group will then be informed of the outcome, at the earliest opportunity. The group in question has been approved for EOCP staffing grant assistance of over &euro;170,000. Subject to the group complying with the terms of their staffing grant and satisfactory contractual arrangements with ADM Limited, its current level of grant support will be extended to 31 December 2007.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 661 and 662 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the applications referred to by the Deputy relate to two applications for transfer of part. Dealing Numbers D2003SM002149U and D2003SM002087R refer. The original registration made regarding this property in the Land Registry appears to be correct in accordance with the documents and maps lodged at that time. Any discrepancy arising with the maps being lodged <Col N="1934"/>with the current application has not arisen as a consequence of an error in the registration process.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that there is no necessary correlation between Land Registry boundaries and ordnance survey detail. A Land Registry map shows the boundaries of the property as agreed between the parties and outlined on the map lodged by the parties at the time the registration was made. The Ordnance Survey map reflects the physical features at the time that the survey is carried out. The Registrar of Titles has informed me that it is not the function of the Land Registry to adjudicate on any discrepancies between the two maps referred to by the Deputy. The position in this case is that parts of the property being transferred in the above dealings are outside of the registered boundaries of the folio. Where part of a property being transferred is outside of the registered boundaries of the property, as registered on the Land Registry map, the appropriate mechanism for any changes to the boundaries is to obtain the consent of the affected parties. The Registrar of Titles has confirmed to me that this position has been brought to the attention of the lodging solicitor. As this is entirely a matter between the parties, no consultations between the Land Registry and the ordnance survey have taken place.</P>
        <P>It is not a matter for the Land Registry to comment on who is entitled to consent to a change in boundaries if the registered owner of a folio is deceased. Any application for registration under Section 49 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 is a separate matter and must be adjudicated on its own merits. The Land Registry has no function with regard to an application for planning permission or to the erection of buildings on a property.</P>

        <P>The accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a record force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Dunboyne Garda station will be fully considered <Col N="1936"/>within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 668 and 669 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks and, under the Act, any person wishing to import fireworks into the State must first obtain an importation licence from me. It is long standing policy to only grant importation licences for organised fireworks displays conducted by professional and experienced operators and not to allow the importation of fireworks for sale to the general public. In effect this policy means that the only fireworks imported into the State and legally held here are those used in professional displays. Typically, these displays range from major events such as the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day Skyfest festival, pop concerts or international sports events to relatively minor displays such as those held at private events such as weddings. Importation licences were granted for almost 400 organised firework displays in 2004. Each application for a licence is subject to the approval of the Garda authorities and the fire officer of the relevant local authority.</P>
        <P>I am very much aware of the dangers posed by their use and of the distress they cause to people, particularly at this time of year. Last February, I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document and it is clear, from the submissions received, that among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, to <Col N="1937"/>bring forward on Committee Stage of that Bill, amendments which will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to increase significantly penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 672 and 673 together.</P>
        <P>In the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 there were, respectively, 11, 15 and 12 applications for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, from both community based/not for profit groups and private sector child care projects in County Kildare. In the same years, eight, 11 and six capital grants were approved, respectively. Applications are not necessarily approved in the same year as they are submitted to my Department.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated that funding approved for County Kildare in the years in question will lead to the creation of 175, 224 and 189 new child care places, and support a further 145, 124 and 99 existing places, in each of the respective years. With regard to the overall number of applications in each of the years in question, these amount, respectively, to 14, 21 and 14. These applications include capital and staffing grant applications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total number of grants approved for community based/not for profit groups and private sector child care projects in County Kildare to date, amounts to 67. Groups may be in receipt of more than one grant under the programme. Cumulatively to date, it is expected that this funding will result in over 1,078 new child care places being created, and a further 665 existing places being supported, through EOCP investment in County Kildare. In addition, the Kildare county child care committee has received a total allocation to date of almost &euro;1 million, which includes &euro;284,500 to deliver its 2005 annual action plan. The committee has also been allocated a total of &euro;120,000 to provide support services for childminders. Child care services in County Kildare also benefit from support given under the EOCP to national voluntary child care organisations to facilitate their work in enhancing quality awareness.</P>

	<P>The person who is the subject of the correspondence, a Romanian national, arrived in the State on 9 August 1999 and applied for asylum. She was refused refugee status by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. A deportation order was made in respect of her on 11 March 2004 and on 17 November 2004 she was deported from the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Numerous representations were made on this person&rsquo;s behalf, including those referred to by the Deputy, the thrust of which was the person concerned was engaged to be married to an Irish citizen. In my response to D&aacute;il Question No. 229 on 17 May 2005 on the matter, I said that I would give the matter further consideration. On 20 May 2005 my Department received further correspondence from the Irish citizen concerned giving further details of the pending marriage. Taking this further information and previous representations into account, I revoked the deportation order on 1 June 2005 and both parties involved were notified of this decision. Given the ongoing consideration involved in this case, it would not have been possible to have given the Deputy a comprehensive reply to her representation before June 2005. I regret that the updated position was not conveyed to her in the meantime and a reply to her representations will issue shortly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the ten year strategy produced by the Tallaght West Childhood <Col N="1940"/>Development Initiative, which seeks to improve children&rsquo;s health, safety, learning and achieving and to increase their sense of community belonging.</P>
        <P>I understand that officials from a number of Departments, including my own Department and from the National Children&rsquo;s Office, will be meeting representatives of the project in the near future. The strategy emphasises the need for joined-up thinking across Departments and agencies. I believe the co-ordinated response at departmental level recognises and supports this approach.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may recall that child care was identified as an investment priority under the national development plan and in 2000 the Government embarked on an ambitious investment programme for child care, the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP. It was launched following the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The total funding available to the programme stands at &euro;499.3 million. This is allocated in the form of capital grants, staffing support grants to community-based not for profit child care providers which cater for very disadvantaged families, funding for quality improvement and ongoing supports to the city and county child care committees and a number of national voluntary child care organisations.</P>
        <P>Under the EOCP, funding of more than &euro;7.8 million has been allocated to child care facilities in the Dublin 24 area of south Dublin. This will lead to the creation of 450 new child care places and the support of 519 existing child care places. I believe the excellent work of the EOCP will be continued beyond its existing remit of 2000 to 2006 and that any follow-on programme will build on the momentum created by the success of the EOCP and will continue to invest in the development of quality child care services.</P>

        <P Just="Left">My Department makes refund of fees to members of staff in accordance with the provisions of Department of Finance circular 21/78.

Since 17 May 2002, Blackberry units have been assigned to 62 of my Department&rsquo;s staff and a small number of other devices have been acquired for research and evaluation purposes.</P>
        <P>The current cost of these devices is between &euro;195 and &euro;242, depending on the model in question, down from an original cost of &euro;484. The cost of the most expensive device acquired during this period was &euro;669, which was for a more fully featured Windows-based device. This was acquired as part of ongoing research and evaluation of mobile technologies, so as to ensure integration with departmental e-mail and calendar facilities.</P>
        <P>Personal digital assistants are issued to the Department&rsquo;s senior management on request and to staff of other grades in accordance with their role, the particular business needs of their division and with the recommendation of the head of the division in question. Their use reflects the high demand made on our increasingly mobile staff for rapid response to issues and enhances communication and productivity, including out of normal office hours.</P>

	<P>The contracts and services pro<Col N="1946"/>vided to my Department by the company in question since 2000 have been outlined below. A contract was awarded to supply and implement a financial management system for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Courts Service, the Irish Prison Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This contract was awarded to the company in question in March 2002. The tender was advertised through the EU Journal and all responses were evaluated on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender by a team comprised of senior officers from each of the end-user agencies.</P>
        <P>The project was managed using PRINCE methodology and included a project board which met regularly for the duration of the project and oversaw all aspects of the project, including quality assurance. The scope of the project was subsequently extended to include services for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>All defined deliverables were completed within the terms of the original contract and as a result of the project coming in under budget, the company in question agreed to include further deliverables outside the scope of the original contract at no additional cost, representing significant value for money for the Department. The costs of this contract for each year in question were: in 2002, &euro;3,039,940.08; in 2003, &euro;4,634,482.06; in 2004, &euro;4,720,749.79; and in 2005, &euro;1,728,833.88.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A separate contract was awarded to the company in question in January 2005 for the supply and implementation of a calculation and payment system for the criminal legal aid process. Similar procurement arrangements applied for this contract as for the financial management system project listed. This contract is for a fixed price of &euro;560,720.40, of which &euro;363,651.00 has been paid to date. This project also came in on time and within budget and represents value for money and a significant improvement on the predecessor system, which had been in operation for a considerable number of years.</P>
        <P>Following an evaluation process carried out by representatives from the asylum agencies and divisions of the Department, a contract was awarded to the company in question for the development of a high level information management and information technology strategic plan for the asylum services.</P>
        <P>Work commenced in May 2002. This work was carried out under the control of a project board made up of representatives from the asylum agencies and divisions of the Department, including business users and information technology users. Board meetings were held at regular intervals and all deliverables were monitored carefully. The contract was for the fixed price of &euro;127,000, including VAT. The final strategy was delivered in October 2002 and is currently being implemented by the Department.</P><Col N="1947"/>

        <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that heroin abuse is a relatively new phenomenon in the Gorey town area. Gorey and its hinterland is one of the fastest growing areas in the south east and is now a satellite town of Dublin with many people from the greater Dublin area settled in the local community. I am informed by the Garda authorities that, to counteract heroin abuse, the local drug unit based at Arklow has been expanded to include members permanently allocated to Gorey. Since the establishment of the unit in Gorey, seizures of heroin and cannabis have increased from five in 2004 to 26 to date in 2005. The growth in heroin abuse is and will remain a high priority from a policing perspective and every effort will continue to be made to prevent and detect illegal drug use.</P>

	<P>The 2002 report of the task force on the physical sciences highlighted the importance of addressing the decline in the numbers of students participating in physics and chemistry at senior cycle and choosing science options in higher education and sets out a range of strategies and actions to address this issue. A quantification in terms of supply and demand for science graduates was not featured in the report.</P>
        <P>The essential need to increase the proportions of science, mathematics, technology and engineering graduates has been highlighted in a range of reports from IBEC, the National Competitiveness Council, expert group on future skills needs etc., as these are seen as critical to supporting high value employment, competitiveness and innovation in a globalised knowledge economy. As part of the Lisbon strategy to make Europe the most advanced knowledge society, member states are committed to reaching a target of 3% of gross domestic product expenditure on investment in research and development by 2010.</P>
        <P>The July 2003 Benchmarking Education and Training in Ireland for Economic Development <Col N="1949"/>report of the expert group on future skills needs highlighted the need to increase the take up and performance in science subjects at senior cycle and to increase the numbers choosing science, technology and engineering subjects in higher education. This issue is further stressed in the study on the Supply and Demand for Skills in the Biotechnology Sector published in September 2003. The fourth report of the expert group on future skills needs in October 2003 quantified the likely demand needs in the ICT, engineering and biotechnology sectors and demand for the next five years are shown in the attached document.</P>
        <P>A further report in August 2004 set out a model to predict the supply and demand for researchers and research personnel to contribute to the Lisbon target. The report highlights that, to meet the overall demands in the economy assuming a 2.5% investment target in research and development, an average demand of 512 PhD graduates and 1,258 non-PhD graduates, degree level or higher, will be needed each year from 2004 to 2010. These projections cover needs across the science, engineering, mathematics and computing sectors.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular that is issued annually to all primary schools. The enrolment in the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2004 warranted a staffing of one teacher. In addition, the school, which is in the rural dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break programme for funding, has the services of a shared rural co-ordinator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent primary staffing appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing.

I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeal board on 15 June 2005. The decision is final.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act 1998 I, as Minister, am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State. Applying this provision to the development of multi-denominational education at primary level, my Department has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through undesignated vocational education committee schools.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, my Department has made a number of changes in recent years that have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band one rating under <Col N="1953"/>the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible that results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable. These measures are a strong indication of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</P>

	<P>The State Examinations Commission is responsible for operational matters concerning the certificate examinations. The commission released data on 12 October 2005 regarding leaving certificate appeals in 2005 that were compiled on an individual subject rather than county basis. A total of 11,567 individual subject appeals were processed resulting in 2,612 upgrades and five downgrades. This means that 3% of the overall grades awarded in the leaving certificate were appealed and 0.7% of the grades were adjusted. These figures exclude a small number of appeals that have yet to be finalised. Further information is available at the State Examinations Commission website, <i>www.examinations.ie</i>. Any upgrading or downgrading in the range above D3 results in a change in CAO points. The points requirements for entry to particular courses are a matter for individual third level colleges in collaboration with the Central Applications Office in accordance with their admission strategies.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular issued annually to all primary schools. The system for allocating <Col N="1955"/>teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>To ensure transparency and openness in the system, an independent primary staffing appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals on mainstream staffing. The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2005-06 school year was considered by the appeal board on 14 June 2005 and was rejected. I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the appeal board&rsquo;s decision on 15 June 2005. The decision of the appeal board is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</P>
        <P>The school made an application for capital funding towards the provision of additional ancillary accommodation. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, which were revised last year following consultation with the education partners. The project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2005-09. The school also made an application for additional accommodation under the additional accommodation scheme 2006. The school planning section of my Department is considering all applications made under this scheme.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy does not provide details of the individual pupils concerned, I am not in a position to comment on any specific cases. However, I understand children from the area identified by the Deputy attend the national school referred to in the details supplied. The general position under the terms of the primary school transport scheme is that children are eligible, subject to conditions, for free transport to their nearest national school or school of amalgamation.</P>
        <P>Pupils not attending their nearest national school or school of amalgamation may, subject to conditions, avail of concessionary fare-paying transport to another school, subject to spare accommodation being available on the bus and provided that no extra State cost is incurred by extending or re-routing the service. The eligibility of such pupils would be assessed for concession<Col N="1956"/>ary fare-paying transport by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which organises school transport on behalf of my Department, subject to the usual terms of the school transport scheme. I understand that, after all eligible pupils were accommodated on the service covering the area referred to by the Deputy, a sufficient number of spare seats was not available to facilitate pupils applying for concessionary fare-paying transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the 2003-04 school year the number of children in classes of 30 or more was 3,260 in Cork city and 9,107 in Cork county. In the 2004-05 school year the provisional figure for the number of children in classes of 30 or more is 3,159 in Cork city and 10,451 in Cork county. The figures for the 2005-06 school year are not available from my Depart<Col N="1957"/>ment. The progress made in reducing class sizes in Cork in recent years is evident from the fact that in 1997, 8,075 children were in classes of 30 or more in Cork city and 13,995 children were in classes of 30 plus in Cork county.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The Deputy should be aware that significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio in recent years. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to a projected 17.1:1 in 2004-05. More than 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts, regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.</P>
        <P>Regarding the number of classes in our schools with over 30 pupils, the Deputy should be aware that the general rule is that schools are staffed on the basis of having a maximum class size of 29 across the school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Therefore, figures on the number of children in classes over 30 should be interpreted with caution. What is more instructive is the average class size in a particular school. The average class size in Cork city in 2004-05 was 22.9 and the average class size in Cork county was 24.6.</P>
        <P>Regarding providing for children with special educational needs, more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools work directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to less than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers now works specifically with children with special needs. The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be further reduced. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

This new approach will ensure the decision-making process in deploying a budget moves from national to local level.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 714, 716 and 717 together.</P>
        <P>My Department was contacted by the chief executive officer of County Mayo Vocational Education Committee, Mr. Joseph Langan, on Friday 7 October about this matter. My officials <Col N="1960"/>requested that the matter be put in writing so it could be considered. As yet no written communication has been received. The adult literacy services are delivered locally by vocational education committees, VECs, under the budget for adult literacy, community education and the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme. The national position regarding the allocations is as follows.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department notified all VECs by letter on 30 March 2005 of their provision for 2005 covering their further education programmes. These include adult literacy and community education programme, the vocational training opportunities scheme, post leaving certificate courses, senior Traveller training centres, Youthreach, and the back to education initiative. The provision for County Mayo VEC for the adult literacy programme in 2005 is &euro;422,187 as against an allocation of &euro;406,176 for 2004. This represents an increase of 10.39% which was one of the highest percentage increases to any VEC. The corresponding increase in the overall subhead was 9%. This increase was in recognition of the demographic factors and the dispersed nature of the population in that county. The number of literacy clients for 2004 was 660.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001, each VEC must remain within its allocation for the year. The VEC has discretion over how it allocates its resources and the nature and extent of adult literacy provided. However, it is expected that each VEC plans its activities to ensure literacy services are available throughout the year, based on the annual budget provided. On a national level, my Department has increased the resources for adult literacy from approximately &euro;1.3 million in 1997 to &euro;22 million this year. Numbers of clients have increased from 5,000 in 2000 to 33,000 in 2004. County Mayo has played its part in the expansion of client numbers and service, as seen by an increase in clients from 316 in 2000 to 660 in 2004. The six month return to June 2005 indicates 763 clients.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the impressive increase in numbers it is important that VECs plan their literacy courses for the full 12 months within the budget provided. I re-iterate that my department was given little prior warning of this matter and looks forward to receiving written communication from County Mayo VEC.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The report of the recent meeting between parent representatives and officials of my Department regarding school transport for first year pupils attending the school referred to by the Deputy has been presented to me and the Minister of State, Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera. The key consideration in this matter was that the arrangements were contrary to the provisions of the post-primary school transport scheme. The Deputy will appreciate that the scheme is intended to be of general application throughout the country and any departure from its provisions damages its integrity. Therefore, while I note the strong views of parents on the matter, my concern is to ensure that such services are accessible by all eligible students on an equal basis.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the home tuition scheme is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils who have a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school. In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants in respect of pupils who cannot attend school at all, or who are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. My Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the pupil in question is enrolled in a mainstream primary school with appropriate supports. The pupil had also been in receipt of a home tuition grant. My Department considers that the most appropriate intervention for all children is school-based and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education would also be able to avail of home tuition grants.</P>
        <P>A number of dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system. More than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools work directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This com<Col N="1962"/>pares to less than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers now works specifically with children with special needs. Approximately 6,000 special needs assistants work in the system, more than &euro;30 million is spent on school transport for special needs pupils and more than &euro;3 million has gone towards specialised equipment and materials.</P>
        <P>My Department has written to this pupil&rsquo;s parents confirming its intention to discontinue the practice of sanctioning home tuition grants for pupils who are also in full-time education. This has also been communicated to the pupil&rsquo;s school. However, in the interim my Department has sanctioned the continuance of the home tuition grant for this pupil to the end of the current school term to allow further consideration to be given to the pupil&rsquo;s needs. In this regard, the school has been requested to make contact with the local special education needs organiser, SENO, to discuss how the needs of the pupil can be met by the school.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware enormous progress has been made over the past number of years as regards increasing the number of teachers and other supports in our schools which are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P><Col N="1963"/>
        <P>At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. At second level, there are approximately 1,600 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares with the approximately 200 teachers that were in place in the 1997-98 school year for such pupils. Furthermore there are approximately 6,300 whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to the issue of resources at school level, the National Council for Special Education has also been established. This council has approximately 100 staff, the great majority of whom are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who are locally based throughout the country. The role of the SENOs is to ensure that all special educational needs in their areas are addressed in an effective manner.</P>
        <P>In particular, the SENOs are a focal point of contact for parents, guardians and schools and process applications for resources for children with special educational needs. I am satisfied that the establishment of the council and the work of the SENOs is transforming the delivery of special educational services in this country. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act was passed in 2004. This Act provides a framework for future development of special educational needs services and provides a legislative basis for assessment, for individual educational plans and for the delivery of services on foot of those plans. It also ensures that parents have a right to be consulted and kept fully informed at all stages of the process. The Act also contains provisions regarding rights of appeal where parents are dissatisfied with decisions concerning the education of their children. I am satisfied that this Act provides a very comprehensive approach to the future delivery of services.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the State has faced up to the issue of providing appropriate educational provision for all children with special needs and that much work has been done to ensure that the necessary resources and structures are in place. I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding a student who has completed a masters and has been accepted for a doctorate in University College Galway who did not qualify for a grant as a mature student in 2004 as they were not over 23 years; if they will be eligible to apply as this is a three year course leading to a doctorate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s third level maintenance grant schemes, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</P>
        <P>Such people are categorised as either independent or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is someone who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding entry or re-entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents&rsquo; incomes or addresses.</P>
        <P>When assessing the means of people other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that the students&rsquo; means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.</P>
        <P>Generally speaking, candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions of the scheme appropriate to their year of entry. Accordingly, candidates who were not classified as independent mature students at the time of entry to an approved course may not generally be assessed as such for the duration of their courses.</P>
        <P>There is, however, provision under the terms of the schemes for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year, to pursue or complete an approved course for the first time. Such candidates may be assessed under the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners. The staffing schedule is outlined in a circular which is issued annually to all primary schools.</P>
        <P>Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals with regard to staffing. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in primary circular 19/02 which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the home tuition scheme is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils who have a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school. In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants in respect of pupils who cannot attend school at all, or who are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. The Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement.</P>
        <P>The Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants. The child referred to by the Deputy was in receipt of a home tuition grant while awaiting school placement. I can confirm that she is now enrolled in a special school since September 2005. Her needs are being catered for in a special class for pupils with autism with a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 together with special needs assistant support. As the pupil is now in full-time education, the matter of the continuance of home tuition no longer arises. The application for home tuition was therefore refused and the parents were notified accordingly on 16 September 2005. I can confirm that my Department has received correspondence from the parent of the pupil in question appealing my Department&rsquo;s decision and a response will issue as quickly as possible.</P>

In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the board and the applicant&rsquo;s legal representative, the matter is referred to the Taxing Master of the High Court for determination.</P>
        <P>The redress board&rsquo;s published guidelines and other publicity material on the redress scheme specifically highlight the fact that all reasonable legal costs incurred in respect of applications for redress are payable by the board. Furthermore, as solicitors are required under law to fully inform their clients, in writing, of the legal costs payable in their case, it is incumbent on the solicitor to inform an applicant to the redress board that all reasonable legal costs will be met by the board and that the applicant should not have to pay any legal costs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Law Society of Ireland is the body responsible under law for regulating the solicitor profession and as such it is a matter for the society to investigate complaints about the conduct of a solicitor. Earlier this year, my Department <Col N="1970"/>became aware that the society had taken the view that it was precluded from investigating complaints from applicants concerning overcharging by solicitors as a result of the prohibition on disclosure of information under section 28 of the redress Act. Arising from this, I included an amendment to this section on the Committee Stage of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005 to enable the Law Society to investigate such complaints. This Bill was enacted into law on 9 July 2005. In early October, the Attorney General wrote to the Law Society and the Bar Council in clarification of the issue. That correspondence is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The redress scheme was set up by the Government to help alleviate the injury and suffering experienced by victims of child abuse in residential institutional care. Awards made by the board are payable in full to the applicant, without any deduction for costs. It is a disgraceful practice that some solicitors take advantage of their clients by overcharging, as reported. I welcome the steps taken by the Law Society to examine and deal with the issue of overcharging by solicitors and to ensure that applicants to the redress board are fully reimbursed where this has arisen. I expect the society to take whatever action is appropriate.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The school planning section of my Department is assessing the post rationalisation accommodation needs of the schools to which the Deputy refers. In this regard, the local inspector has been requested to provide long-term projections for both schools to establish the extent of accommodation needed to facilitate the amalgamation. In addition, a technical inspection has been carried out on the existing buildings to determine which, if either, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. A greenfield site solution will be necessary if a host does not emerge. The technical report will be available in the Department shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the meantime, the project has been assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria for large scale projects. It will be considered for commencement of architectural planning when the various strands have been pulled together in terms of the long-term projected enrolment and a proposed accommodation solution.</P>

	<P>My Department funds the provision of adult literacy, which is delivered by the vocational education committees, from the adult literacy and community education &mdash; ALCES &mdash; budget. The national development plan committed &euro;93.5 million to the service in the period 2000-06, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients over that period. This target will be met.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s budget for adult literacy for the years 2000-05 was &euro;10.6 million for 2000; &euro;13.6 million for 2001; &euro;16.7 million for 2002; &euro;17.9 million for 2003; &euro;19.2 million for 2004; and &euro;22 million for 2005. My Department, under a separate budget, provides for an education service in the prisons. This prison education budget includes literacy.</P>
        <P>The amount allocated to City of Dublin VEC for literacy initiatives in each of the years 2001-05 was &euro;1,194,457 for 2001; &euro;2,718,106 for 2002; &euro;2,687,136 for 2003; &euro;2,734,000 for 2004; and &euro;2,908,406 for 2005. The amount allocated for the year 2000 is not readily available as it is archived. The Department will, however, furnish this information to the Deputy within the next few days. It should be noted that the figure for 2005 represents the provision only.</P>
        <P>The returns made to the Department for the year ended December 2004 indicate that City of Dublin VEC has four full-time and six part-time adult literacy organisers; D&uacute;n Laoghaire VEC has one full-time and no part-time adult literacy organiser; and County Dublin VEC has five full-time and six part-time adult literacy organisers. The Dublin Adult Learning Centre is funded separately to provide literacy services in its catchment area.

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. The scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible in nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The school referred to by the Deputy receives secretarial grant assistance under this scheme. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;127 in 2004, is being further increased to &euro;133 this year.</P>
        <P>The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of &euro;7,980 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of &euro;66,500 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, provided the school in question does not already have either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme. Where a school already has either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme, the rate of grant payable is &euro;66.50 per pupil and the minimum and maximum grants payable are &euro;3,990 and &euro;33,250 respectively.</P>
        <P>The school to which the Deputy refers has the services of a full-time caretaker under the 1978-79 scheme. Accordingly, the rate of grant payable in the case of this school this year under the ancillary services scheme is &euro;66.50 per pupil.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 747 and 765 together.</P>
        <P>A key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. The wide variety of measures in place in Tallaght and other similar areas for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflects these concerns. These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children&rsquo;s literacy problems, reduced pupil-teacher ratios, increased capitation grants and measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, family and community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth and in providing second chance education for young people and adults.</P>
        <P>DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; the new action plan for educational inclusion, which I launched last May, aims to ensure the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 second-level schools will be included in the school support programme. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures being adopted under the new action plan. The new school support programme will integrate a number of schemes and programmes that are cur<Col N="1978"/>rently benefiting schools in west Tallaght. Moving to a single programme of supports for all disadvantaged schools will result in a far more integrated and co-ordinated approach, one of the key principles of the childhood development initiative. The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered by my Department in the context of the implementation of the new action plan.</P>

	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, I advise the Deputy that at primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, there are approximately 1,600 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to a figure of approximately 200 teachers who were in place in the 1997-98 school year for such pupils. In addition, there are approximately 336 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary and second level schools in County Galway supporting children with special needs. The National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing any applications for additional special educational needs, SEN, resources. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring all children with special educational needs, including in east Galway, receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>I also confirm that I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the NCSE, ensure that all children with special educational needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>

	<P>As I confirmed for the Deputy on 28 September last, my Department reviewed the file on the child concerned in the last school year and based on the documentation that was submitted to my Department it was determined that the child concerned falls into the high incidence disability category.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a new general allocation system has been announced under which schools have been provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. Under the new system, the school in question has a specific teaching allocation of one full-time post and five hours.</P>
        <P>The teaching posts being provided under the new general allocation scheme are designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and <Col N="1980"/>children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular &mdash; Sp Ed 02/05 &mdash; to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities. It is open to the parents of the pupil in question to contact the school to discuss with the principal and teaching staff the type of provision that the school intends to put in place for the pupil.</P>

	<P>Four members of my Department&rsquo;s staff have received leave of absence in excess of two months for educational purposes since 2002. One staff member participated in the visiting research fellowship programme at the Policy Institute, Trinity College Dublin &mdash; TCD &mdash; from September to December 2004 &mdash; four months. The Policy Institute is a multidisciplinary public policy research institute based in TCD. Further information can be found on their website &mdash;<i>http://www.policyinstitute.tcd.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>One staff member completed the masters degree programme in public policy analysis over the two academic years 2003-2005. Two others have embarked upon the programme at the start of the current academic year. The programme is a two year full-time programme involving academic study and projects in public policy evaluation. The primary aim of the programme is to enhance the capabilities of personnel within the public sector to analyse policy and thus to contribute to decision-making on the allocation of public money. Successful completion of the programme will result in the award of an National University of Ireland &mdash; NUI &mdash; accredited M.Econ.Sc. in public policy analysis. An officer whose participation on the training programme is not satisfactory may at any time during the training period be returned to her or his former position or other <Col N="1983"/>suitable vacancy at that level and duties without delay and any entitlement to an allowance or subsequent appointment to assistant principal under the terms of the scheme will then cease.</P>
        <P>Staff may also avail of a career break for educational purposes. Educational purposes may be deemed to encompass certain training courses which include a practical training element for which there is a nominal payment or grant made to the student. Career breaks are not available for educational purposes where the student or trainee is in an employment relationship with the training body and is in receipt of a normal salary or wage. There are no terms or conditions relating to academic achievement attaching to the granting of such leave. However, career breaks for educational purposes may not be granted for longer than the period of the particular course of study and/or training.</P>

        <P>Details of refund of fees in respect of night-time or weekend study courses attended by staff in my Department over the last three years, 2002-2004, are in the following tables. Some 80 members of staff applied for a refund of fees in respect of courses undertaken at night or evenings in 2005. The value of refunds expected to be made in 2005 is &euro;169,392. Of those approved to attend a course in the last academic year, 11 staff members did not subsequently apply for a refund of fees.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance circular 21/78 governs refund of fees in respect of courses pursued in an officer&rsquo;s own time. Officers pursuing approved courses may have the appropriate course and examination fees refunded to them. The refund will be made at the end of each completed academic year or corresponding course period, that is, where it is established, normally by written statement from the institution providing the course, that the officer gave satisfactory attendance at the course &mdash; or participated satisfactorily in the course, if it is a correspondence course &mdash; during the academic year or period and underwent the relevant examinations or other prescribed tests. My Department has, to date, been in a position to recoup 100% of fees for approved courses.</P>
        <P>My Department recognises the importance of training and developing its staff and seeks to promote a learning and development culture within the organisation. The Department has a pilot scheme in place for the advance payment of fees for post-graduate studies undertaken in the officer&rsquo;s own time and of particular relevance to the Department.</P>
        <P>Each officer to whom a payment is made is required to undertake in writing to refund the payment in the event of leaving the public service before completing one year&rsquo;s service in respect of each academic year or course period for which a payment has been made, the academic years or course periods themselves not to reckon as service in this context. </P><Col N="1983"/>

        <P>Personal digital assistants are not allocated as a matter of course. A request for a PDA must be supported by a business case approved by the head of the relevant business unit. The request is then assessed by the IT unit and either granted or refused.</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy that I am most anxious that children with disabilities should have their educational needs addressed within the jurisdiction. Decisions to place children in facilities outside the State have only been taken in exceptional circumstances and would usually have arisen because of the very specialised educational or health care-medical needs of the children involved.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which was established recently, and which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports.</P>
        <P>My Department officials have been informed by the NCSE that the matter has been referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO. The SENO is currently examining the issues raised by the Deputy and will be in direct contact with the relevant parties in the near future.</P>

	<P>The property in question comprises a site of approximately 0.6 acres, together with a dilapidated prefabricated structure. The property was vacated by the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, in March 2004 on health and safety grounds. A Portacabin on the site is currently used for storage. As it is not feasible to refurbish the prefabricated structure, it has been decided to offer the site for sale on the open market. The local RDF unit will occupy the former Garda station with effect from next week and will require use of that entire premises. I regret, therefore, that it will not be possible to meet the requirements of the local Red Cross.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the civilian personnel employed in building maintenance work at military installations throughout the country. I should explain that under the Sustaining Progress agreement the application of pay increases arising under the benchmarking process to employees in the State sector requires the approval of the relevant performance verification group, PVG, for that sector.</P>
        <P>With regard to the civilian personnel engaged in building maintenance, the PVG decided that the payment of the benchmarking pay increases was warranted in the case of these employees. Progress has been made in a number of areas in recent years, including the introduction of work sheets for employees engaged in building maintenance and the implementation of the performance management and development system, PMDS, for all civilian personnel.</P>
        <P>The cost of implementing the benchmarking pay increases for approximately 550 civilian employees involved in building maintenance at military installations is estimated at &euro;5 million for the period from 1 December 2001 to 31 December 2005.</P><Col N="1991"/>
        <P>The Deputy also refers to a report regarding maintenance work in his question. I have not received any such report. However, outside contractors have been used to an increasing extent <Col N="1992"/>over recent years for building maintenance work and that trend is likely to continue.</P>
        <P>The statistics requested by the Deputy on the absenteeism rate for the specified grades are contained in the following tabular statement.</P><Col N="1991"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 782 and 823 together.</P>
        <P>The cap on local authority staffing levels arises from a Government decision of December 2002 to cap public service numbers at the existing authorised level and to reduce numbers by 5,000 across all sectors by the end of 2005. The number of local authority staff is to be reduced by 1,000 over that period. Local authorities were informed of the reduction required in the overall local government sector over the three-year period 2003 to 2005. This requirement is borne in mind when local authorities apply to the Department for the approval of additional posts. The general position is monitored by the Department on a quarterly basis. Each county and city manager is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. The Department is keeping the overall position under review with regard to the employment demands of each local authority.</P>

The assessments were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2004-06, which was published in May 2004. Given the rating afforded to the scheme by the council, it was not possible to include it in the programme.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 modernises the legislative framework, supports community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy and underpins the programme of local government renewal. The Act takes account of <Col N="2000"/>the recommendations of Towards Cohesive Local Government &mdash; Town and County, which is the 1996 report of the reorganisation commission on improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for non-local authority towns within county council areas. The report concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that the widespread creation of new town authorities was neither warranted nor feasible and recommended that only towns with a population of 7,500 or over be eligible for consideration. Accordingly, section 185 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. I understand Glanmire would not fall within the required population threshold.</P>

	<P>The plant in question is a waste to energy plant. It is being procured by Dublin City Council on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities in accordance with their joint waste management plan. The plan provides for energy recovery as part of an integrated approach to waste management in the region in which thermal treatment will deal with the residue after maximum prevention, recycling and <Col N="2001"/>recovery. The specification for the proposed plant is consistent with the requirements for thermal treatment of waste identified in An Agreed Programme for Government. As the envisaged procurement of the plant is by way of public private partnership, the role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the matter is to ensure compliance with public policy on public private partnership procurement. Following submissions from Dublin City Council and consultation with the National Development Finance Agency, the necessary certification of compliance has been issued. It is a matter for Dublin City Council to enter into resulting contractual arrangements.</P>

	<P>The nuclear safety section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has the important mandate, as when it operated previously from the Department of Public Enterprise, of leading the development of national policy, legislation and regulation in respect of nuclear safety; participating in international co-operation arrangements at EU and other international levels for nuclear safety; representing Ireland in the further development of the arrangements; co-ordinating and implementing action by Ireland, including legal actions, against the risks posed to Ireland by nuclear operations in other jurisdictions, particularly by the Sellafield plant; and supporting the work of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. Since the transfer of the responsibilities to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in June 2002, the nuclear safety section has operated within the Department&rsquo;s environment division, which comprises one principal officer, three assistant principal officers, one administrative officer, two higher executive officers, one executive officer, one staff officer and two clerical officers.</P>

	<P>The Local Agenda 21 environmental partnership fund scheme promotes sustainable development by assisting, at a local level, environmental awareness projects which involve partnership arrangements between local authorities and local community groups, schools and environmental non-governmental organisations. The scheme is co-funded on a 50-50 basis by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities. Since the scheme was introduced in 1997, the Department has contributed &euro;1,910,409 to 1,055 projects funded under the scheme. The level of funding and the number of projects assisted has increased each year, with 208 projects receiving assistance in 2004. Many of the successful projects have recycling and waste awareness as their theme. As in previous years, projects under the 2005 scheme, which was announced in September 2005, are encouraged to support the objectives of the Department&rsquo;s waste awareness campaign, Race Against Waste. Local authorities are asked to give priority to projects which supported Local Agenda 21, a multifaceted blueprint for sustainable local communities that are economically strong, socially inclusive and environmentally friendly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 796 and 797 together.</P>
        <P>The product in question, genetically modified oilseed rape GT73, was authorised by the European Commission on 31 August 2005 for importation into the European Community for use as animal feed and for industrial use. The authorisation did not include cultivation. I am advised that oilseed rape imported into this country is processed prior to its importation by crushing and having its oil extracted. This minimises the possibility of live seed entering the environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In so far as the TRIPs agreement is concerned, this falls within the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and obliges WTO member states to provide patent protection for any invention in all fields of technology. However, I understand that the grant of a patent confers only a civil right on the patent owner to prevent others from doing what is claimed in the patent and grants no right to its owner to make use of his or her invention. The TRIPs agreement does not contain any specific provision on contamination of crops by patented genetic material.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 805 and 806 together.</P>
        <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 175 of 29 September and Questions Nos. 536 and 557 of 4 October where I outlined the main actions to date in implementing the rental accommodation <Col N="2010"/>scheme, RAS. Under this scheme announced by the Government in July 2004, local authorities will over a four-year period progressively assume responsibility for accommodating supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more continuous duration with a long-term housing need. The RAS is a collaborative project between my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, local authorities and the community welfare service. Implementation of the scheme is being monitored closely and monthly progress reports are being prepared by the programme managers employed to co-ordinate the roll-out of the scheme by the local authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Later this year an interim independent evaluation of the operation of the new arrangements for implementing RAS will be carried out. The evaluation will consider any further measures required to ensure the effectiveness of the roll out of the scheme. Where any additional details or amendments emerge in the light of the evaluation that impinge on the rent supplement scheme these will be brought to the attention of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Roll-out of the RAS commenced in an initial group of lead authorities, namely Dublin, Galway and Limerick city councils, south Dublin, Donegal, Offaly-Westmeath county councils, and Drogheda Borough Council. Cork city and county councils and South Tipperary County Council are now implementing the RAS. All local authorities are due to implement the new arrangements during 2005.</P>
        <P>The first transfers to the RAS occurred in September 2005. Some 31 households have transferred from the SWA rent supplement scheme in the Galway City Council. It is estimated that a further 300 households will transfer to the RAS later this month, the majority of which will be in the Dublin city, Galway city and south Dublin county council areas.</P>
        <P>First indications from the various agencies involved to the RAS have been generally positive. A number of seminars have been held in the lead local authorities to inform accommodation providers of the new scheme and receive their views. In addition, my Department has engaged the housing unit to arrange a series of information seminars, commencing in early November, to focus on the background to the establishment of the scheme and the policy and implementation issues currently facing implementing local authorities, community welfare service and the Departments concerned. These seminars will provide a vehicle for further feedback on the roll-out of the RAS.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>if <Col N="2011"/>his attention has been drawn to a difficulty being experienced by purchasers of affordable housing under section 9 or 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 who wish to change their mortgage from the local authority to a financial institution, as the claw-back concept is attached to the mortgage and not the property; if he has received representations on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[29263/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Houses sold under the various affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value contain a claw-back provision which is necessary to ensure that there is no short term profiteering on the resale of a house. In the traditional circumstances where local authorities were the sole supplier of mortgage finance for affordable housing, authorities registered the claw-back as a charge on the mortgage deed or, in the case of shared ownership transactions, inserted it as a clause or condition in the lease. This allowed them, as the lender, readily to enforce the claw-back. Two of the main financial institutions are now introducing schemes of mortgage financing for persons who wish to access affordable housing.</P>
        <P>Following extensive discussions with my Department, agreement was reached with these institutions on the rankings of the various charges, which included provision for a claw-back as a charge on the property, in the context of implementing the new mortgage products. Discussions are under way with several other leading private lenders with a view to initiating similar products. Since the introduction of these mortgage products, I have received representations regarding the difficulties being encountered by persons wishing to re-mortgage with the private lenders. It is reasonable for a local authority to allow re-mortgage through a private lender provided the claw-back provision is fully protected; and it would be a matter for the local authority in such cases to ensure that the claw-back can be imposed as provided for in legislation. However, with a view to achieving a widely agreed solution for this kind of case, my Department is in communication with the private lenders about standardising arrangements. I hope that these would be finalised urgently and put in place as soon as possible.</P>

Each city and county council was invited by my Department to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area. The closing date for receipt of applications from local authorities was 15 July 2005. City and county councils responded positively to this new initiative and the proposals submitted are at an advanced stage of consideration. Kildare County Council submitted one application in respect of Newbridge sports and leisure centre. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement regarding the successful projects shortly.</P>

        <P>My Department&rsquo;s training and development strategy 2004-09 aims to support the process of ongoing learning for staff. In support of this, my Department operates a scheme whereby staff can <Col N="2015"/>have their fees paid in full or in part at the beginning of the academic year for their attendance at courses that are relevant and beneficial to both staff and the work of the Department.</P>
        <P>In 2005 my Department will spend approximately 17% of its training budget on payments-refunds to staff in respect of night-time or weekend study courses. Details of applications and projected payments for 2005 are set out in the following table. </P>

	<P>My Department does not operate a formal system of exemption from duties in relation to any of its staff. Its published human resources strategy seeks to promote a positive working environment based on the equal treatment of all staff while respecting their individual differences and needs. The strategy aims also to foster teamwork and collaboration and to support the achievement of work-life balance for staff. The overall objective is to develop the Department as a responsive, capable and flexible organisation in line with good human resource practice. My Department works in partnership with unions and staff to give implement these provisions of its human resources strategy and is satisfied with the effective working arrangements which these provide.</P>

	<P>Following an open procurement process, my Department appointed consultants in July 2005 as part of a programme of further assessment, testing and validation of the electronic voting and counting system. The brief is to undertake a security and risk assessment of all aspects of the system and to devise a programme of additional testing. This is intended to address issues raised by the Commission on Electronic Voting and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately.</P>
        <P>The consultancy work is under way and will be completed as soon as possible. Pending completion of the work and consideration of the outcome, it is not possible to speculate on the cost of any modifications which could arise in this regard.</P>

	<P>The current output of the water production plants in the greater <Col N="2019"/>Dublin area, including Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, is approximately 560 million litres per day. A range of projects to further expand capacity is being advanced under my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2004-2006. These include Kildare Wellfield development, Leixlip water treatment plant extension, Navan water supply scheme, Wicklow town water supply scheme and the expansion of the Ballymore Eustace water treatment plant. The Ballymore Eustace scheme alone will increase capacity <Col N="2020"/>by 66 million litres per day. In addition, the programme also includes funding to support the identification of new sources to meet projected demand in the greater Dublin area up to 2031.</P>
        <P>Since 1996, over &euro;55 million has been spent on ongoing water conservation works in the region to reduce unaccounted for water and water losses in the distribution system. These measures, taken together, are designed to ensure the availability of adequate water supplies to meet the needs of the greater Dublin area in the medium term. </P>
