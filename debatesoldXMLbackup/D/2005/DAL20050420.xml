    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that 33,000 fewer patients went through accident and emergency units in 2003 than in 1998. Last week in response to a question in the D&aacute;il the Taoiseach admitted that accident and emergency facilities were, in his words, &ldquo;not up to scratch&rdquo;. What is a crisis in the rest of the country, and what has driven nurses the length and breadth of the country to protest outside hospitals during lunch time, is simply &ldquo;not up to scratch&rdquo; in the eyes of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>This morning we learned that the situation is much worse. The independent report of the Health and Safety Authority has criticised the level of congestion in accident and emergency units around the country. It says this increases the risk of injury, infection and violence from frustrated patients. There are reports of trolleys, chairs and medical equipment being stored in fire protected corridors. Some eight of the hospitals inspected since March have been reported to fire officers because exit doors and corridors have been blocked. Yesterday 283 patients were on trolleys in accident and emergency departments and there are serious reports of deep frustration and of anger verging on violence among some patients in some units.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s response to this has been to fly a kite about the availability of a hospital at St. Bricin&rsquo;s, which will not happen now. There are complaints from nurses of being intimidated by management when highlighting the impossible conditions in which they are expected to work. The T&aacute;naiste has said that the nursing home charges issue is putting patients off moving out of hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been, or is supposed to have been, in charge for the past eight years. This situation in the fourth richest country in the world is unacceptable. Conditions in accident and emergency hospitals in some places around the country are appalling. What does the Taoiseach intend to do about this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;instead of talking about plans and his vision for the future? He has been eight years at the job and we are still talking about plans. When is he going to take action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go through the numbers. I have already explained how many people go through our accident and emergency units. I am glad Deputy Kenny has distinguished between ones that are overcrowded and those that work extremely well. That is the position.</P>
      <P>As I said previously, the action is that this year alone we have put a substantial part of both the capital and revenue budgets into providing extra facilities. Those facilities range from better cleaning to better complex tasks such as MRI scans&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no change on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach without interruption. This is Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been eight years of waffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in Beaumont as part of this year&rsquo;s plan. We are providing acute medical units in Tallaght, Beaumont and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospitals. This will mean that people who go to hospital with problems and medical conditions such as respiratory illness or diabetes can be assessed and observed without waiting for long periods in accident and emergency units. Other hospitals around the country have found that these units work well. Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al has also pointed this out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach ever visited the accident and emergency unit in the Mater Hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Kenny, these acute medical units have begun. They are positive actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to give way for a second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mind, a Ceann Comhairle. This is the disruption we get every Wednesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question. He is the only Member entitled to submit the question. The Taoiseach is entitled to the courtesy of silence to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy does not behave the Chair will take appropriate action. Allow the Taoiseach continue without interruption.</P>

	<P>If the Taoiseach waffles, the patients are the people who suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are buying beds from the private sector for step-down care for hundreds of patients this year who no longer need to stay in hospital. I assure Deputy Kenny that this is working and has been happening over the past few weeks. People are moving from acute beds into private nursing homes. This is a costly way of dealing with it, but the Government is doing it. We are contracting for long-term nursing care beds for many people who need higher level care than would be available in the community. We are providing special home care packages for 500 people currently awaiting discharge from acute hospitals. This will help families and older people in their homes and communities and free up beds. We are ensuring we will be able to get access to general practitioners outside of normal working hours so that people do not have to go to accident and emergency units with normal problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the doctor-on-call service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>All of these are not long-term actions but are under way now. Deputy Kenny raised the issue of the Health and Safety Authority&rsquo;s report which is out today. The authority has completed its programme of inspections in 11 accident and emergency departments. It has acknowledged that the hospitals are fully engaged in the process of addressing health and safety in accident and emergency units. The report also says there should be management changes. There should be changes in bed practices within hospitals. The CEO of the HSA met the chief executive of the HSE yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We need new management in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSA has indicated that it is satisfied that the HSE is committed to addressing the areas of concern, that it will prioritise the management of health and safety issues and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This is more management waffle and jargon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that it will highlight in its actions the recommendations of the inspectors. The HSA has secured the commitment of the HSE to examine the health system in the wider sense. This follows a meeting that took place yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Willie beat the T&aacute;naiste in the punch up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply shows the scale of the appalling lack of competency of this Government over the past eight years. That it takes a HSA report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Nobody likes a smart ass.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1524"/>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputies Rabbitte and O&rsquo;Dea to desist from interrupting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am a smart ass, the Minister is illiterate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why the Deputy is taken nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware the Minister for Defence was flying a phantom last night with St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital, which is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true. The Deputy should correct himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy O&rsquo;Dea to allow Deputy Kenny to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Wee Willie Winkle should go back and place his order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response sets out the scale of incompetence and devastation. After eight years, it has taken an independent report by the Health and Safety Authority to trigger the measures to which he referred. If a major hotel had blocked fire escapes and trolleys in its corridors, there would be calls by Members to close the facility.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that patients attending hospitals in the coming period will not be in danger given the violence, frustration and carry on mentioned in the report? God forbid but if there was a serious accident following the Luas derailment earlier, could hospitals have coped and implemented the major accident and emergency plan?</P>
      <P>My final three questions relate to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children&rsquo;s ten-point plan. When will the minor injuries units be developed and expanded? Where are they? When will they open? When will the Government provide the MRI scanner at Beaumont Hospital? Will it be this year or next year? Will the Taoiseach, for God&rsquo;s sake, see to it that scandalous conditions in toilet units in hospitals are cleaned up once for all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was interrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy had plenty of injury time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have evidence from people who are normally responsible who say they would be ashamed to have anything to do with the level of filth and dirt in some toilet units in some hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1525"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The second MRI scanner will be provided in Beaumont Hospital this year. The resources have been made available for the medical units. I cannot be certain about when the work will be finished on them but the money has been provided this year. Hopefully, they will be ready as soon as possible. The major accident and emergency plan is in place and, thankfully, it has always served us well. It creates disruption for others in hospital when it is invoked but it works well and it is upgraded all the time.</P>
      <P>All these initiatives are under way but they are additional to ongoing work. Issues such as cleaning and so on should not arise because costly contracts are in place but I accept this report has highlighted some of these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Contracts are the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It also highlights management issues in the hospital, which also must be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Too much management and not enough workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps there is too much management but we have to try to deal with the situation as it is. We are trying to provide the best services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We are looking for solutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Everybody accepts that once one gets through accident and emergency, hospital services are excellent. There is a problem in accident and emergency and we are trying to deal with that. We have put huge resources into staff, equipment and the physical infrastructure to address this issue and we are committed to continuing to do what we can to get them all up to the same standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the Cabinet programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy did not do a whole pile when he was in charge of the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was my junior Minister. He barely ever turned up. He was too busy knocking on doors in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not get anything with the Deputy. He blocked everything. He was in the Department all the time doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Only for M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, nothing would have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government parties are eight years in office and they have made a hames of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1526"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Rabbitte. I ask Deputy O&rsquo;Dea to remain silent and allow Deputy Rabbitte to ask his questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I was provoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is easy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn was right about that much. The Taoiseach will probably be aware that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, launched a report yesterday on the childhood development initiative. The report deals in great detail with the impact on children as young as ten of anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has not seen the report, I recommend it to him, because when I raised the question of anti-social behaviour with him last week, I was completely bemused by his reply, as were people outside the House. If the Taoiseach had received as big a response to the issue as I have, he would know the extent of the breakdown of the fabric of society in many communities. Instead, he wandered, making a number of different claims. He said we have 14,000 garda&iacute; but, according to a reply to a parliamentary question by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we have 12,200. The Taoiseach then detailed at great length his struggle to implement the Criminal Justice Act but that was introduced by a Fine Gael-Labour Government.</P>
      <P>He then talked about community policing and instanced his struggle in this regard, stating:</P>
      <P LI="1">I recall what the Opposition said when two years ago a community garda in this city stood up to deal with the unfair elements. I answered in this House for that garda who tried to clear out a few hooligans and vandals from the May Day celebrations. I was trying to defend the poor man. The Labour Party talks about community garda&iacute; but gives no support to community policing.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Taoiseach made a most unfortunate choice. That particular garda and the events of May Day are something that ought not to be celebrated or defended in this House. There is no single, simple solution to this phenomenon that threatens the fabric of society in many communities and neighbourhoods but community policing is one of the solutions. The resources devoted to community policing are entirely inadequate and inconsistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>They are non-existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is well aware that, for example, initiatives such as the JLO scheme have as many garda&iacute; devoted to them as the Garda driving pool. The resources are not put into the measures that could address this issue in society. Unfortunate people are being tortured in their own communities because of the actions of young thugs and hooligans who are out of control, with no parental responsibility. The <Col N="1527"/>Taoiseach&rsquo;s answer the last day sought to trivialise rather than deal with a serious social issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know why the Deputy takes an account of something I did not say last week. I did not in any way trivialise it. I said the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2005, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing in, is a serious Bill and I asked Members to support it. It contains strong measures and criminologists and others have stated the Bill is too tough. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will address the point made by the Deputy. It will strengthen the investigative powers of the Garda. We are recruiting to get up to 14,000 garda&iacute;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a correction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will deal with powers of arrest, search and detention powers, powers to fingerprint and to take DNA samples. The Minister has stated he will introduce additional provisions on Committee Stage to address other issues relating to criminal gangs, the control of firearms, curfew orders and powers to place civil orders on individuals whom, as Deputy Rabbitte rightly said, act out of order in society. We have an enormous range of powers and, in so far as the current legislation is not strong enough, the Minister will strengthen it with, I hope, everybody&rsquo;s support in the House.</P>
      <P>A small number of individuals, some of whom are very young and some of whom may be under the influence of drink and drugs, believe they can intimidate their communities. The only way to deal with that is through the Garda. I said last week nobody should recommend that there is another way to deal with this, though people at times get frustrated about these issues. The only way to do so is to have sufficient garda&iacute; and a force of 14,000 would put Ireland much higher on a <i>pro rata</i> basis than every country in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have 14,000 garda&iacute;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>There are fewer garda&iacute; in Clonmel now than ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 200 garda&iacute; have been recruited, not 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They have sufficient legislative powers to deal with these criminals in a tough and rough way. I do not think anyone outside the House is saying the curfew and civil orders to name and isolate such individuals in their communities are not tough law. The Government is introducing what is necessary, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will bring it before the House in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is out of touch. I read in one of the newspapers this morning about his doing six hours&rsquo; canvassing on Saturday and <Col N="1528"/>another few hours on Sunday. If he did it at the right times of the day, he would know that the issue is not law but the lack of enforcement. The Taoiseach keeps coming to the House and offering solutions in the shape of more law and tougher speeches from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The fact is that considerable powers are available to garda&iacute;, but they either do not have the resources or they are not deployed in a fashion that allows them to implement the law. People <i>in extremis</i> in their own homes are dialling Garda stations from which they receive no response. There is an absence of community garda&iacute; patrolling neighbourhoods. Garda&iacute; are simply not there to do the job that modern living conditions require. People are besieged in their own homes, persecuted and harassed for no apparent reason.</P>
      <P>For example, the Taoiseach talks about more law. What about the Child Care Act? It has been on the Statute Book for the past four years, but the Taoiseach has still not invoked major sections. Part 8 covers widespread community sanctions, but it has not yet been implemented. If there were such widespread community sanctions and those young vandals were required to clean up some of the mess they had created&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in those neighbourhoods, that would be real action. However, while tough speeches promise more laws, there is no action in the neighbourhoods where people suffer harassment and persecution for no reason but that they are old, vulnerable, women living alone or merely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is long since concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>People are being driven out of their own estates and desperately seeking transfers from local authorities. We have witnessed the breakdown of society in many of those areas, and it is not good enough to come to the House asking if the Opposition will support tough laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to give way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to implement the tough laws that are in place and provide the resources to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Enormous resources have been made available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regarding its numbers, overtime, equipment and intelligence. I do not think it takes too much Garda strength to deal with 13 or 14 year olds, or, as Deputy Rabbitte said, 12 year olds. They are not armed criminal gangs. Most of what Deputy Rabbitte has been talking about has been done by children causing disruption in their own areas. <Col N="1529"/>The Children Act 2001 &mdash; not the Child Care Act, as Deputy Rabbitte said &mdash; has sections relating to trying to counsel families and rehabilitate such children. One cannot lock them up, and I will not enforce such a policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Taoiseach not implement the provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The sections regarding family counselling, trying to establish control, home liaison and teaching such children that life has a proper order are being implemented. For those who must unfortunately be removed from society, large amounts of resources are being made available, as the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said yesterday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte did not mention it, but I am sure that he, like me, has attended many public meetings where garda&iacute; have said in front of several hundred people that there are cases where they do not have the powers to act regarding young people. The garda&iacute; are continually pointing this out. They say that night after night, in hall after hall, to the citizens of this country, and they do so not because they want to dodge their responsibilities but because they believe they need tougher powers to deal with some of those gangs of hoodlums and thugs who simply want to manipulate communities. No one has any respect for them, and there are cases where they simply have to be removed from their communities, but we do not have the powers to do so. We have to have civil and curfew orders to deal with it; that is the point the garda&iacute; are making. We can pass the legislation and then, one hopes, our garda&iacute; will enforce it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on this point. We passed laws in this House many years ago about not drinking in public or walking around with boxes of drink or ghetto-blasters. Many of those powers are ignored, but they exist for the garda&iacute; to implement tonight if they so wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week some 300 people protested outside the gates of Cavan General Hospital in the pouring rain in solidarity with the Irish Nurses&rsquo; Organisation&rsquo;s campaign entitled &ldquo;Enough is Enough&rdquo;, and with citizens and patients who continue to suffer daily in accident and emergency units throughout the country. They were joined in Cavan and elsewhere by elected representatives of all opinion, including from Fianna F&aacute;il. Is the Taoiseach not aware that citizens are absolutely outraged that this crisis in accident and emergency units continues despite all the promises and commitments that have been made and the money that has undisputedly been spent on the health services? It happens despite all the pledges by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, when she took up her position more than six months ago.</P>
      <P>The honeymoon period is long over, and it is now time for the Minister to be accountable, not <Col N="1530"/>only to this House, but to the citizens. I ask the Taoiseach to forget the text that he used in his response to Deputy Kenny. Instead, I ask him to stand here today and, in his own words, tell the House what he and Deputy Harney intend to do today to address the situation. It is outrageous that eight hospitals have been reported to fire officers because exit doors and corridors are blocked. That means not only that citizens are suffering on trolleys in accident and emergency units but that they are also at risk from fire and such other potential hazards and emergencies that might arise.</P>

	<P>Will the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste meet the Health Service Executive and call on it not to go ahead with its plan for 2005, which entails a cut of some 600 jobs at the coalface of health care delivery and which the INO itself has said will result in bed closures and make the situation in accident and emergency even worse?</P>

	<P>Where are the additional 2,250 acute hospital beds, the 4,000 elderly care beds and the 60 primary care units promised in the Government&rsquo;s health strategy? This is a very serious issue, and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s textbook reply will simply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask the Deputy to give way to the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not suffice. We want to know what the Taoiseach intends to do today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already answered this. The Deputy asked me to explain matters in my own words, something I did for Deputy Kenny. He wanted to know what actions were currently being taken, and I gave him those. They are under way now, in addition to what has already been put in place. I will give those points again. Those actions are significant.</P>
      <P>Why is there a problem in accident and emergency? Many people argue there is not a problem in that department but with beds elsewhere. That is why we have added 500 beds. Step-down places are being provided in the private sector so that people in acute hospitals can move to suitable and excellent care facilities not in such hospitals, thus freeing the beds so that people can move through accident and emergency more quickly. That is the issue.</P>
      <P>As I said, everyone accepts that, whether with cancer, cardiac or other services, when people are in hospital, they receive good treatment, operations and aftercare. However, with accident and emergency, because of people staying a long time <Col N="1531"/>in beds &mdash; far longer than was traditionally the case &mdash; one needs more beds. That is why we have the step-down beds. We already have 200 extra public beds this year, as well as out-of-hours GP services. People do not stop getting sick at 5 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Where there are no such services in communities, people go to the accident and emergency department, and that exerts further pressure.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>When people are blind drunk or drugged and start to fight or become involved in public order disturbances, they often end up in accident and emergency departments, which puts further pressure on such services. A significant proportion of the &euro;11.5 billion allocated each year to the health service, which has 100,000 staff, is spent by the Government on measures to improve the accident and emergency service. The Government is confident that such measures will help to alleviate some of the difficulties we have encountered in recent years. The Deputy is aware that the Government is also investing in a substantial capital programme that will bring new hospitals and services on stream.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer my questions in his response. The electorate will not be convinced that the Taoiseach has addressed the serious matters raised by Deputy Kenny and me in a satisfactory manner. How does the Taoiseach respond to the pathetic excuse offered by the Minister for Health and Children last Monday? She said that the issue of nursing home charges was to blame for her failure to deliver on the ten-point plan she has proposed for dealing with the crisis in accident and emergency departments. Is the Taoiseach aware that the fire service in Dublin has indicated that the crisis in accident and emergency units is affecting its ability to respond to emergencies because fire brigade crews have to queue with patients after being called to attend to various problems? If fire fighters are stuck in long queues, they will not be available to respond to other emergencies which <Col N="1533"/>arise. What is the Taoiseach doing to address this very serious matter?</P>
      <P>What does the Taoiseach have to say to nurses who have pointed out that the employment ceilings imposed on the health services are preventing the recruitment of additional staff to ease the crisis in our accident and emergency departments? Is it true that the moneys which are being allocated to implement the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten-point plan are being taken from the original financial allocation made to each hospital? The redistribution of such moneys will result in other cutbacks in 2005. It is time for the Taoiseach to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that the provision of an additional &euro;1 billion can hardly be described as a cutback. I hope the resources being invested in the health system will solve all the problems in that sector.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a point about beds and facilities. He said that people should be able to access step-down places. Nobody has said that the controversy about nursing home charges has caused the problems mentioned by the Deputy. The T&aacute;naiste made the point, which I had made previously, that hospitals have argued that people are now less inclined to leave acute hospitals to go to nursing homes. That phenomenon has been reported by nurses &mdash; I presume they have also mentioned it to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. I assure the Deputy, if he is interested in what we are doing rather than me giving anything else, that people are starting to receive the special home care packages to enable them to leave hospitals. Some 500 step-down places are being provided by the private sector and nursing home places for long-term stays will soon be contracted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The primary focus of my recent visit to Washington was Northern Ireland. I briefed President Bush and members of the US Congress on recent developments. I met civic leaders from Northern Ireland and the McCartney family at the White House. When I met Robert McCartney&rsquo;s sisters and partner again last Monday week, I reiterated our continuing and full support for them. Their campaign has the support of the Irish people and political leaders throughout the world. The McCartney family has shown great courage. I condemn in the strongest possible terms the intimidation endured by members of the family last week when they tried to inform people of a vigil for Robert McCartney. As I said previously, to bring the killers of Mr. McCartney to justice would be a good way of demonstrating that the republican movement is committed to making progress in the peace process.</P>
        <P>I am extremely grateful for the continued support of President Bush, the Bush Administration <Col N="1537"/>and our friends in the US Congress for our efforts in respect of Northern Ireland and their strong encouragement for our attempts to secure an end to paramilitarism and criminality and to encourage the pursuit of purely peaceful and democratic means.</P>
        <P>Gerry Adams&rsquo;s appeal to the IRA is significant and has potential, but it can ultimately be judged only on the basis of the IRA&rsquo;s actions on foot of it. He has asked the IRA to initiate internal consultations on the steps they must take as quickly as possible. The IRA has since said it will give Gerry Adams&rsquo;s appeal due consideration and will respond in due course. It is vital that the IRA&rsquo;s consultations should be concluded in a timely manner and that everyone should know that the necessary steps have been taken and will be adhered to, and that the IRA is moving on. Nothing less than a complete and decisive end to all IRA activity and capability will be acceptable if there is to be any prospect of achieving inclusive politics in Northern Ireland. The only way forward is through peaceful and democratic means.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to work to implement the Good Friday Agreement in full. During my recent meetings with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and the political parties, we reviewed recent developments and the prospects for progress. The Government will continue its efforts to achieve an inclusive and comprehensive peace settlement. I hope it will be possible to re-engage with the parties after the British general election and to explore the prospects for progress.</P>
        <P>While I was in the United States, I took the opportunity to visit Syracuse, Baltimore and New York, where I was pleased to receive an award from the American Lung Association in recognition of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, by introducing the smoking ban, to the association&rsquo;s vision of a world free of lung disease. When I was in Washington, I availed of the opportunity to meet representatives of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. I greatly welcome the invaluable insights and inputs that I receive from the members of the board. I briefed them on the peace process and on economic developments since the visit by a delegation from the board to Ireland in September 2004.</P>
        <P>At my recent meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, I raised the question of a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. The Government wants the standard agreed at Weston Park and set by Judge Cory to be adhered to. Mr. Blair has made clear in his discussions and correspondence with me that this is also the intention of the British Government. We continue to share the concern of the Finucane family that the new UK Inquiries Act 2005, under which the British Government intends to have the Finucane case investigated, will not meet the standards. The case was also discussed with President Bush during my recent visit to Washington.</P>
        <P>Deputies are aware that a major Garda investigation into money laundering is under way. As inquiries are continuing, it would not be appro<Col N="1538"/>priate to make a further comment on the details of the operation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Have new or creative ideas emerged to break the current logjam in the peace process? Is the Taoiseach aware that many people are concerned about the vacuum in the North, particularly in the stalled talks process? I urge the Taoiseach, after the elections, to become involved more directly and to kick start the process.</P>
        <P>It was significant that Gerry Adams stated the way forward is by building political support for republican and democratic objectives across Ireland and by winning support for these goals internationally. Does the Taoiseach consider this statement to be a positive development? Does it offer an opportunity to move the process forward?</P>
        <P>Gloating or seeking victory in the peace process will not get us anywhere, it will only lead us down a cul-de-sac. Does the Taoiseach accept that all victims of the Troubles should be treated with equal respect? In his remarks, the Taoiseach mentioned Robert McCartney and Pat Finucane. I welcome that because there are many victims who feel that the broader political establishment here and in the North does not care about them. We should perhaps revisit the idea of a commission for victims to recognise their needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tried to avoid entering any new initiatives. During the election campaign I want to be sensitive to all sides and parties and I do not want to say anything that might damage any of them. I am concerned, however, that during the campaign people will make statements and manifesto commitments that will make positions harder after the election. Depending on the results, we must deal with that on the other side of the election but there are worrying issues and developments that will make the position quite difficult.</P>
        <P>Issues can be made difficult by manifestos and statements &mdash; I can quote them if people would like me to, but I would prefer not to do so. Those following the elections will see what I mean. Candidates are pinning themselves to difficult positions, not just for this year or next year but for a generation, which is 25 years. Many of the statements being made are not helpful and will not make life easier after the election.</P>
        <P>The statement by Gerry Adams is significant. It has potential but we need to see what the IRA says and does on foot of it. When the Government met Sinn F&eacute;in in January we made it clear that it must reflect on the key issues that must be addressed by the republican movement if the peace process is to get back on course, as everyone wants. We are mindful that the elections are under way and approach any comments made in that environment with some caution.</P>
        <P>In making this obvious comment, however, I am not trying to diminish Gerry Adams&rsquo;s remarks. Mr. Adams said the republican move<Col N="1539"/>ment has reached a defining moment. For so many years there have been false dawns and dashed hopes, as I have said many times in recent months, and the last few months have crystalised the challenges that must be addressed. The crisis of trust and confidence is profound and will not be easily repaired. Only a complete transformation of the situation will generate the energy needed to move beyond the current stalemate that the Deputy mentioned and realise the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
        <P>I would rather not move beyond the Good Friday Agreement. There are many well meaning people with bright ideas but unfortunately they are all outside of the Good Friday Agreement. I have always taken the view that the Agreement can be reviewed in so far as allowance is made for that in it, but we cannot go off in another direction.</P>
        <P>One of the issues people have raised in the election is abandoning the d&rsquo;Hondt system. One cannot abandon the d&rsquo;Hondt system and stay within the Good Friday Agreement. That would immediately remove the power sharing element from the executive. I know what people are trying to achieve when they say that but that will not solve the problem.</P>
        <P>I am not in the business of over or under-analysing Gerry Adams&rsquo;s remarks but like most other people in the country and elsewhere who are committed to democratic and peaceful politics, I want to know what the IRA will say. I am not demanding that it be said tomorrow or the next day because that is unrealistic &mdash; we will wait for the day &mdash; but we cannot fudge any of these issues. Ambiguity will not work, that has been brought to the fore in recent months. The fact that Gerry Adams has realised that and made a significant statement that has potential, and is prepared to lead the republican movement in a different way without the IRA in its existing form and to deal with criminality and the other issues, must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>At every opportunity I try to mention every group. I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that this involves everyone on all sides. The case of Rosemary Nelson has just started in the courts. There are many other cases involving people from the Protestant and loyalist side as well as the republican and Nationalist side. Prime Minister Blair&rsquo;s apology to the Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon, Paddy Armstrong, Paddy Hill, Caroline Richardson, and the Maguires earlier this year was a stark reminder of that legacy and the pain that victims still endure, many because of physical injuries and many because of psychological trauma. I include in that all people from all sides. I am not sure if any more can be done in this area but I am always ready to look at some way of dealing with and acknowledging all of the families. As we move into a more peaceful mode, many of these families think about how little was done at the time to deal with their particular bereavement or case. I understand that. It is easy <Col N="1540"/>for me to say but it is they who have to live with it. It is not easily done, as we have found in the past, but it is not something I have ever ruled out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view that the d&rsquo;Hondt system for the appointment of Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive is an essential part of the Good Friday Agreement. I understand that when the DUP publishes its election manifesto tomorrow, it will say that it will turn away from this system. Does the Taoiseach regard that as a serious threat to a core element of the Good Friday Agreement or just as electioneering to consolidate the party&rsquo;s vote?</P>
        <P>On the statement issued by the President of Sinn F&eacute;in, Gerry Adams, I draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to a fundamental point. On 15 December when the Taoiseach was replying to questions in the D&aacute;il, he outlined the comprehensive agreement that the two Governments had sought to bring about before the talks finished because of the difficulty with the photographs. Speaking on that occasion, the Taoiseach confirmed to Members and to the public that the statement that was issued by the IRA at the time confirmed &ldquo;its intentions in regard to that organisation moving to a new mode, issuing instructions to volunteers and completing decommissioning to a rapid timescale&rdquo; but did not address the issue of other illegal activity with the clarity that was needed. The thrust of the statement issued recently by the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Gerry Adams, invited the IRA to hold a comprehensive internal discussion about a matter that had already been decided by the IRA in the statement it issued and to which the Taoiseach referred on 15 December. Does the Taoiseach share the view that the IRA stated its intent, that this decision was made prior to the breakdown of the talks last December and that the Sinn F&eacute;in President&rsquo;s statement now is merely going back to discuss something that has already been decided?</P>
        <P>In respect of his visit to America recently where he met President Bush, was there any contact with him or his officials in respect of the Irish illegals in the United States, of which I understand there are some 50,000? Reports here from the American Embassy and the ambassador&rsquo;s staff indicate that they are anxious to regularise the position. The Taoiseach is aware that these can be awkward and sensitive in some cases. Was there discussion about that? Did the Taoiseach find there was a willingness to accommodate it and on what basis can we proceed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to make a categoric comment on a manifesto that is due out tomorrow. I do not know but from what I have read, and I have been following this issue, and if it is as it seems, it appears to reflect a hardening of their position, including ruling out the d&rsquo;Hondt voting system. Without getting into the election, it is a core element of the Good Friday Agreement under which a power-sharing executive is assured. Without going over the issue, it is an <Col N="1541"/>unwelcome development because it cannot be made work. Perhaps when I negotiated the Good Friday Agreement I did not absolutely understand how it would work but having been through it to get the executive up and running, I became an expert on it and without it we could not have a power-sharing executive. There is no other mechanism.</P>
        <P>When I read that in conjunction with what has been said by Peter Robinson, and perhaps he was misquoted, that it might take a generation to make any progress, that indicates enormous scepticism in terms of where we were last December. That is the only point I am making. We had difficulties within the past few months and we are trying to deal with those.</P>
        <P>There was a willingness in the talks that ended unsuccessfully on 8 December for the republican movement to move to a new mode. The difference between that and the statement we have seen is that I am fairly certain it was not worked through the whole republican movement throughout the island in the way that it was debated and agreed upon here and that they would formally move to what Gerry Adams is now asking of them &mdash; an end game and to recreate themselves in some other form, and that is their business, but away from paramilitarism, criminality, training and all of the other issues. That is the distinction. While there was a willingness to do these things on the part of the leadership of the movement, it was not something that had the ground-swell of support. My view is that because it did not have that, it led to what I believe was the IRA robbery on 20 December and other activities. I suppose that is true of any organisation. As I have said many times before, the people in the republican movement have their own rules and orders and they have to follow their own procedures. The fact that they are into a process of considering that now is good. Obviously, the result will be the important aspect. It will not be much use to us all unless there is a conclusive result without conditions but time will tell in that regard. It is not an issue for now but I hope it will be later in the summer.</P>
        <P>I took the opportunity this year of having a good engagement with the US President on the position of the illegal Irish in the US. This issue has become acute because of the new procedures they have introduced, particularly the one on driving licences which has caught many people who perhaps had their heads under the parapet. The new procedures mean they are off the road and that is difficult for people living in the United States. We raised this issue but we have no idea of the number of people who are in this position, although the Department of Foreign Affairs and the organisations in the United States have been trying to get a proper handle on the statistics.</P>
        <P>There is a willingness on the part of the President, the Administration and friends of Ireland on the Hill to help with this issue. Their problem is the way they deal with countries like ours, which they do not see as a problem because, by <Col N="1542"/>and large, very few people now emigrate to the United States; if anything, people are returning here from the US. The Deputy will be aware that because of these issues the trend is for people who did not come back in the past number of years to come back now. There has been an upward trend in the past 12 months in the number of families and people who emigrated before the 1980s to return here, and that can only be linked to the fact that they are finding it too hot, so to speak, in the new environment.</P>
        <P>The problem not just for the President but the Houses of Congress is finding a scheme that deals with the Mexican situation. It is easy to deal with our situation and that of other countries like ours but the Mexican situation is very difficult. There are many bright people looking at this and we will make any suggestions we can but we need to make some progress. There is a willingness to do it but we cannot get Ireland dealt with separately.</P>
        <P>The President spoke about the quota system but there is no longer a quota system; perhaps they will bring it back in some form. We will continue to pursue it during the course of the year. We have built up a liaison through the ambassador who has been meeting many of the Irish groups during the winter and trying to get an assessment of the number of Irish illegals. The official figures are a bit of a nonsense, although we should probably not say that. They indicate there are 3,000 or 4,000 illegal Irish in the country but we know that in the Boston area alone there could be 10,000. I am not sure of the figures but we will continue to help. Congressman Walsh, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd and others are being quite helpful in trying to assist us with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach agree that in this electioneering period the temptation to engage in megaphone diplomacy must be resisted at all times? Will he acknowledge that it is particularly important that his Cabinet colleagues resist any temptation, regardless of the provocation, to engage in megaphone diplomacy? Will he acknowledge also the frustration felt by parties on this side of the House that are not engaged in the current fora and the fact that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, for example, is not in session? I accept there is not a pressing need for it but will the Taoiseach acknowledge the need to give Opposition parties an opportunity to bring themselves up to date on issues and offer suggestions in line with the Good Friday Agreement without having to resort to megaphone diplomacy?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree, and this proves my point because I can only raise it in this forum, with the suggestion by David Trimble that the SDLP and the UUP coming together would be fraught with difficulties, particularly in respect of the Good Friday Agreement? Does he see that as having any potential? On the other hand, does he agree with the SDLP view of the need to appoint an interim executive, for example, an idea no doubt borne out of frustration at the lack <Col N="1543"/>of progress? What progress does the Taoiseach believe can be made to encourage the British Government to provide the necessary evidence and co-operation in the Barron inquiry or the Pat Finucane inquiry? Is there potential for progress in the current period or must everything wait until after the election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Sargent that we should not practice megaphone diplomacy. Neither my colleagues nor I have done so for several weeks on any side. I will be careful and make brief points. I do not want to say anything for that reason about the DUP or the UUP. I will stay out of it and people will make their own decisions on the arguments. They will certainly not be influenced by me nor will their voters.</P>
        <P>I am always ready to have Forum for Peace and Reconciliation meetings if I think it is meaningful to hold them. The significant issue will have to be picked up and addressed on the other side of the elections in summer or, as most parties suggest, in September due to the marching season. We have never made much progress during the season in good not to mind bad years. I agree with the point which has been made that negotiation must take place on the Good Friday Agreement. I will say nothing which opens up the prospect that we will proceed on any other basis. I cannot do otherwise and wish people would stop asking me to reconsider during the campaign.</P>
        <P>The Good Friday Agreement is the agreement we are trying to implement. While there was a great deal of controversy about some aspects of it, we accepted the review and went out of our way to be helpful to the parties to it, especially the DUP. We thought that was the right thing to do tactically. To set off on a process which is outside the Good Friday Agreement is something I will not do. I see no other way of moving on.</P>
        <P>The logical conclusion of moving away from the agreement is intergovernmentalism, which is something parties in the North, especially in the Unionist tradition, very much oppose. If one moves away from the Good Friday Agreement, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, whoever they are, take over and adopt an intergovernmental approach. As such an approach has traditionally been opposed, we must work with the Good Friday Agreement and establish how we can make progress. While I do not mind the heat of the election, I object for the reasons outlined to very prescriptive manifestos which have the potential to make life very difficult. In the context of tomorrow&rsquo;s publication of the DUP manifesto, I reiterate that the Irish Government cannot agree to and will not negotiate the exclusion of the d&rsquo;Honte system. We will not entertain that proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said he did not expect within the next day or so a definitive response from the IRA to the speech by the pres<Col N="1544"/>ident of Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr. Gerry Adams. Putting the most benign construction on the speech, will the Taoiseach indicate what constitutes a reasonable time to wait for a response? Does the Taoiseach agree that the issue is not whether Sinn F&eacute;in should break away from the IRA, as suggested by a number of commentators and posited in a newspaper poll which asked if the time had come to leave the IRA behind, but that we ought to ask if the time has come for the republican movement to disband it? It is a different question. If it is not asked, the work of the past ten years will not advance us as significantly as intended.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach gave a qualified welcome to the statement by Mr. Gerry Adams and I join him in that. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform says decommissioning is no longer an issue but an embarrassment to the IRA which holds an arsenal of weapons for which there is no use. He said it is the strategic objective of the republican movement to maintain small arms and the wherewithal to enforce its wish in communities and raise funds. There are significant issues to address in this context. Presumably the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform speaks with the benefit of intelligence. As Deputy Kenny said, most people who voted for the Good Friday Agreement thought these issues had been resolved. Is it not timely to resolve them now without equivocation, doubt or ambiguity about what has been decided?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree entirely with Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s last point. I agree also that it would defeat our purposes if Sinn F&eacute;in were to move away from the IRA but the IRA were to continue to function. While the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership is trying to bring the IRA into a new mode which excludes paramilitarism, we contend that the related criminality should also be excluded. They do not agree, but the ending of criminality is what I view as the acid test. I do not necessarily agree with those who say the IRA must disband in a way which precludes its members from meeting for commemorative reasons. We have had that scenario before, but it is a different issue in terms of functions. It is what I understand the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership is endeavouring to do.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked about a reasonable period to await a response. As the process, we are told, is a consultative one which must take place throughout the island and beyond, it will take a few months. I assume that is what we are talking about rather than a period of years. The comments of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be viewed in the context of the information that as of last weekend there continues to be training, recruiting and, more worryingly though perhaps not directly related, a cross-over, to say the least, into criminal activities.</P>
        <P>The criminal activity is carried out by people who have been involved in the IRA, but I will not get into an argument about whether they are still inside the net. It is not always easy to know <Col N="1545"/>who is in or who is out and I can understand that may also be the case for the republican movement. We have seen instances of the difficulty overnight. I do not have the full facts, but I am aware of a serious drug case overnight involving people with a past record of IRA involvement. These are the concerns of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with which we must deal.</P>
        <P>The central point is that on the other side of the election we must manage, as always, the marching season. I appreciate the commitment of republicans and loyalists to get through the difficult summer season, which is always especially problematic when there is a vacuum. We must then attempt to move forward to implement fully the Good Friday Agreement, deal with outstanding issues and maintain agreement on the matters decided last December. I accept that there are difficult issues. I hope people do not add to the difficulty by getting themselves into positions from which it will be very hard to get out. If things are nailed down too tightly in manifestos and people say it is part of their mandate then we will be in a very difficult position. I hope people avoid doing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the last items of legislation enacted by the Westminster Parliament before its dissolution was the Inquiries Act. Will the Taoiseach tell us if he has raised with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the absolute unacceptability of this Act to the Irish people? Did the Taoiseach receive any commitment whatsoever from Prime Minister Blair, regarding the scrapping or amending of this Act, which we all know would allow a British Minister to effectively gag an inquiry and is designed to prevent any real inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane and others who were victims of collusion?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the Finucane family&rsquo;s request to all senior British judges not to serve on any inquiry that is brought about under this totally unacceptable Act? Would the Taoiseach be prepared to echo the call of the Finucane family, given all the facts he must now know in regard to it?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with Judge Saville of the Bloody Sunday inquiry who said this Act would make serious inroads into the independence of any inquiry that would be constituted under its terms?</P>
        <P>I noted what the Taoiseach said in reply to an earlier question, that he would &ldquo;stay out of that one&rdquo;. He was referring to the tussle between the DUP and the UUP in the current elections. That is fair enough.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In conclusion, does the Taoiseach believe it is inappropriate for Ministers, senior representatives of his party, to <Col N="1546"/>involve themselves directly in those elections in the interests of one party? How does he believe that impacts on the opinion of his impartiality and objectivity in regard to engagement with other political parties now and in future, specifically Sinn F&eacute;in?

	<P>On the issue of Pat Finucane, we have been dealing with all the points made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. We have taken up all the points he made. I met Geraldine Finucane and the Finucane family on two occasions recently which coincided with the 16th anniversary of the murder of Pat Finucane. It is well past time for a proper public inquiry to be held into this terrible case.</P>
        <P>Our objective is to secure an independent public inquiry as set out at Weston Park. That view has also been represented by Judge Cory who shares the Finucane family&rsquo;s concern about the British legislation. We have lobbied on that legislation. We got many changes but not changes that give us confidence. Tony Blair and others have argued about how they can make this work but they have not convinced us at this stage. We have exchanged correspondence with the British Government and the family. It is our view that the British Government should honour the commitment in a manner that has the confidence of Pat Finucane&rsquo;s family. That is the issue. It has to do that.</P><Col N="1547"/>
        <P>The family has our full and continuous support in its tireless efforts over many years to get to the full truth in what is a disturbing case. Officials remain in close contact with the family and we will continue to help them and to give them our advice and support in whatever way we can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised my question was included in this lot. I refer the Taoiseach to an article in <i>The Irish World</i> of 11 March where he is reported as saying while he was opening the RTE Millbank offices in London, that he hoped the complex issues of providing RTE coverage for the Irish in Britain in particular could be resolved. During a recent visit there with colleagues it was the top issue, particularly among the first generation Irish community, and it was also identified in the task force report as one of the issues that needed to be tackled.</P>
        <P>The sum of &euro;8 million was provided although that report concluded that funding of &euro;34 million per year would be required. Subsequently I contacted the director general of RTE, Cathal Goan, who advised me that the provision of the service was feasible, that it was both technically and legally possible and that the only outstanding issue was funding. The DTT system and the DSat system in the UK could be used for this purpose.</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach consider giving the required &euro;34 million, as outlined in the task force report? I welcome the &euro;8 million that has been provided. It is a major step forward. Will he examine the issue to see if further funding can be provided for this area? If that is not possible will he examine the possibility of ring-fencing an increase in the licence fee to fund this purpose as a thank you to the 800,000 people who went abroad and sent home money to us when we needed it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised the issue because there is a great desire from first, second and third generation Irish people who now take a very active interest in Irish political and cultural affairs. I hoped that within the resources of the licence fee which we tried to increase it could perhaps be done, but I understand there is pressure. We should try to find a way of progressing this.</P>
        <P>What has happened in Northern Ireland recently has been very helpful. Many younger Irish people abroad have got used to watching programmes on the Internet but they would like to be able to do it in a more comprehensive way. It would be good for us. We should pursue it, given the fact that it is technologically feasible and that it does not sound astronomically costly to do so. I assure Deputy Stagg that I will follow it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the other party leaders in congratulating Pope Benedict XVI on his election. It is an occasion of great joy all around the country, not for just Catholics, but for everyone. It is a time of great hope for Christians and people of goodwill everywhere. The former Cardinal Ratzinger is a man who has given his life in faithful service to the church. He has worked hard as a theologian and scholar of considerable note from the time of the Second Vatical Council. That is a long time ago. Like every Pope before him, he will bring his own perspectives and talents to the papacy.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate the new Pope on his election. I hope he will find the <Col N="1549"/>strength, the faith and the wisdom required to do a difficult job on the world stage in the years ahead. As I said yesterday, I hope that at some stage during his pontificate he will perhaps be able to take up the invitation Pope John Paul II accepted, to visit Ireland. I know Pope Benedict was here before, in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Maynooth, and perhaps he will visit Ireland again. I join Members of the House in wishing him well in his difficult role in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Taoiseach in congratulating Pope Benedict XVI and wish him every success in what is one of the most onerous and awesomely responsible positions in the world. The new Pope obviously has an unparalleled opportunity to effect greater unity and understanding between peoples and to encourage everyone of faith, and none, to work for a more just and caring world. The legacy his predecessor, Pope John Paul II left, and his identification of the great obstacles to the progress of humanity towards having life, food, peace and freedom are still huge challenges in which the new Pope can give his own form of leadership.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach pointed out, he is a man with a brilliant mind and a long and active involvement in theology. He is also a deeply spiritual man. I pray, as do Catholics all over the world, that this deep sense of spirituality will help him to be the pastor the church desperately needs to deal with the serious challenges it faces in the years ahead. I hope he will be able to give guidance to the people of God, as it were, and above all lead and treat them with compassion and understanding. I share the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view that he might be able to carry into effect Pope John Paul II&rsquo;s intention to visit Ireland. Invitations for papal visits have probably flooded the Vatican already. Perhaps Pope Benedict XVI may choose to come to Ireland. I hope he does. I wish him well in his challenging role as the new pastor of the Roman Catholic Church. I pray that he will have the wisdom and compassion to face those challenges as he attempts to build an inclusive church during his remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join the Taoiseach and leader of Fine Gael in congratulating Pope Benedict XVI and wish him well in his awesome task. He succeeds a Pope who was never afraid to tell the great and the good where he stood on matters of peace and war. It is noteworthy that his namesake, Pope Benedict XV, sought to exercise an influence in preventing the First World War. I hope that is an omen for the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI.</P>
      <P>I would like to believe there may be a change of direction in the governance of the Catholic church, in responding to the movement for social justice in South America and elsewhere in the world. I would like to believe the stance his predecessor adopted might be reviewed on the issue that is causing such devastation in Africa, the health-related and other matters that arise from <Col N="1550"/>the AIDS epidemic which is the cause of death for tens of thousands of people. On behalf of the Labour Party I join my colleagues in the House in offering the new Pope every good wish in his pontificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Green Party, I, too, extend good wishes to His Holiness, Pope Benedict XVI. I hope and pray he will have the courage, humility and the strength of spiritual leadership to confront the many challenges that currently face the world, wherever he may go, whether war, poverty or injustice, some within his own church. I hope he continues the enthusiastic work of his predecessor in drawing attention to and making a plea for what he termed an ecological conversion, namely, the compassion humanity and the wider web of life needs to confront the problems that have arisen as a result &mdash; as Pope John Paul II said &mdash; of the way humanity acted as &ldquo;an autonomous despot&rdquo; in relation to the rest of creation. This needs to be faced up to. That ecological conversion needs to be given practical effect.</P>
      <P>As a Catholic from a reformed tradition, and on behalf of the many people who are not Roman Catholic, I hope the new Pope will continue the work of his predecessor in reaching out to other traditions. That is particularly pertinent and helpful on this island, as we hope to overcome many long years of intolerance and build a tolerant and mutually respectful society in which Pope Benedict XVI will I hope play an active and positive role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, join the other party leaders in congratulating Cardinal Ratzinger on his election as the 265th Pope. He comes to the papacy at a very challenging time for the Catholic church. Pope John Paul was admired for many reasons. It is difficult to think of anyone in modern times who has had so much influence for good. His stance on peace and human rights was greatly admired and inspired many people worldwide. The response to his death, particularly from young people, indicates that people want leadership and a spiritual dimension to their lives.</P>
      <P>As a Catholic I certainly hope the role of the laity can be taken more seriously in the church, and that the different perspectives can be harnessed, particularly the role of women. Pope Benedict XVI will have many challenges to face. He is a scholar, a theologian and he has a brilliant mind. The greatest challenge he faces at a time of enormous change in the world is to inspire and to lead Catholics, and through this to have closer relationships with people in other churches. The challenges facing the papacy today are different from those in the past. Deputy Rabbitte referred to the AIDS crisis and there are many other issues. There is perhaps no one else in the world with as much influence for good as the Pope. I wish him well in the challenging times ahead in <Col N="1551"/>mobilising his influence to bring greater justice to the world.</P>

      <?oasys _ah?>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s record is excellent. Since the foundation of the State, it has been a most effective unarmed force. It came into being when the Civil War began and later it had to cope with 30 years of paramilitary violence and serious crime. Its work has not been easy, with incidents such as those encountered in Donegal, which brought no credit to the force. However, its contribution to the State has been immense. It has lost members in protecting society and dealing with crime.</P>
      <P>The Garda and the prison system will not eliminate crime in society. In particular, low level crime proves to be a source of fear for many vulnerable people in society. Elderly people live in fear of young people, wearing jackets with hoods, hovering outside their homes. As they all dress the same way with these hoods, they are unidentifiable. We must find a solution to the problem of these unidentified young people who gather in an intimidatory manner and who might also be carrying out crime and vandalism and generally indulging in anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last week that when the Education (Welfare) Act was going through the House I sought to have it amended to provide for education welfare officers. As a former teacher, I considered such an amendment necessary to deal with children who are at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour, crime, substance abuse and so forth. These children are identifiable at a young age by teachers. The problem is that whereas there are many agencies and Departments to deal with them, the services are not co-ordinated and the greatest weakness is that there is no specific desk at which the buck stops.</P>
      <P>A welfare officer should be appointed for each VEC area. Cases would be referred to that officer in the first instance by teachers, the garda&iacute; or anybody who sees a child at risk and believes there is a need for that child, and perhaps its parents, to be assisted. If we are to have any success in steering young people away from leading worthless lives, they must be dealt with in a holistic manner, that is, in the context of the family. Where parents are in dereliction of their duty to their children either through lack of parenting skills or downright neglect, they could be brought before the education welfare officer. This could be done not in a confrontational manner but in a way which allows the situation to be judged and a plan to be devised to assist the parents, with the help of the support organisations, to bring that family back to an even keel so the children can grow up to be useful members of society. Cur<Col N="1555"/>rently, the buck is passed and no person has responsibility for ensuring, for example, that such a plan is implemented. The education officer should have the power to call the agencies and Departments to account if a representative of a Department or agency did not deliver or did not co-operate fully with other organisations.</P>
      <P>This illustrates a weakness in the legislation before us. A great opportunity was lost with regard to establishing an independent commission on policing, such as was established in Northern Ireland on foot of the Good Friday Agreement. The commission, which had a year to complete its work, consulted far and wide. It took written submissions and heard oral evidence and the views and opinions of various stakeholders on policing.</P>
      <P>Many people in society feel alienated from the system. We often hear about low level crime. It can be devastating for vulnerable people but it is virtually impossible to secure a conviction for such crime. There is the problem of evidence. All too often people who can give evidence are afraid to do so. This is understandable given the circumstances that pertain in large urban areas. Equally, it is difficult, if not impossible, to secure a conviction when there is no forensic evidence as a result of the garda&iacute; being called after the culprits are long gone. The solution to this problem lies in preventing it occurring, as best one can, through the education welfare officer system I have proposed.</P>
      <P>I recall an urban area in my constituency where young men would emerge in the early afternoon, following a morning spent in bed, and assemble in a public area to drink beer from cans. I cannot say if they were also taking drugs. At least some of these young people were in receipt of unemployment assistance. To qualify for unemployment assistance a person must be available for work and genuinely seeking work. Where the garda&iacute; become aware of people behaving in that manner there should be a duty on them to report it to the Department of Social and Family Affairs so the people involved can be taken to task in regard to their efforts to seek employment and to be available for work.</P>
      <P>These people are paid money by the State to which, in the right circumstances, they are entitled. However, they use it to purchase drink. They are allowed to do that but the practice of consuming drink on the street means they constitute a nuisance at best or, at worst and all too often, intimidators. This matter should be urgently examined. People need enough money to survive but obviously these people can survive and still have enough money to purchase alcohol. It is not a straightforward situation but it might be possible to bring these people to their senses if they are made to realise that if they are getting paid unemployment assistance they should not use it to get drunk in a public area and make that area hell for others.</P><Col N="1556"/>
      <P>This Bill is deficient in addressing these issues. The opportunity was missed to conduct wider consultation and to put a commission in place when this legislation was being drafted. With the Patten model there was consultation with every police station and the views of people were heard. Every area has a different story and different problems but some areas might have devised ways of preventing the continuation of low level, intimidatory crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome the joint policing committees proposed in the legislation. However, there are faults, in that the provisions are not sufficiently comprehensive. I refer Members to the Labour Party&rsquo;s document on the police force, which was produced by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, and which was substantially based on the Patten model. These committees have commendable duties to perform. The members are to consist of nominated members of local authorities and that is how it should be. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the committees will be nominated by the Garda Commissioner. Members of the Oireachtas will also be on the committees, as will persons nominated by other bodies. The guidelines on these joint policing committees have not yet been circulated but the community and voluntary sector should have places on these committees by right. Many of these community and voluntary groups have a great knowledge of what it is like to be a victim of anti-social behaviour and low level crime. The feed of information that could come from this sector is an important ingredient to develop police policies that will make our country a better place in which to live. I hope that the Minister looks at this on Committee Stage. The joint policing committees need to be as small as possible to be effective. However, the main players should be included, and they would comprise all those groups that have a real contribution to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to examine a few sections in this Bill. One of the most welcome developments is in section 31 which provides for the establishment of the joint policing committee with Garda and local authority representation. This measure will help to build a proper forum for communication between garda&iacute; and local residents of a community. Joint policing committees represent a step in the right direction to tackle the problem of anti-social behaviour in local areas. Like Deputy O&rsquo;Shea, I believe that community-based organisations should be represented along with officials from local authorities and elected representatives. These local policing committees must have a place for voluntary organisations that operate in communities because they have information on what is taking place in their areas.</P>
      <P>Provisional figures show an 11% decrease in serious crime for the first quarter of 2005 and such a reduction is welcome. However, the level of anti-social behaviour is increasing. Such behaviour may be deemed a minor offence, but it is <Col N="1557"/>on the increase in all constituencies. As a public representative, I am contacted by constituents more about anti-social behaviour than serious crime.</P>
      <P>As a former member of South Dublin County Council, I sat on a committee with Deputy Rabbitte that was established by the council. It was formed to deal primarily with joyriding and anti-social behaviour. The committee also consisted of the county manager, a number of key staff from the local authority and the two chief superintendents for the various jurisdictions. We met once a month and I found the experience interesting as we could see progress being made. I frequently speak to garda&iacute; and they wish the council did more on some issues. On the other hand, council officials have often told me that such issues are for the Garda.</P>
      <P>This committee brought tangible solutions to real issues. It was not the answer to everything. However, in some instances of joyriding, garda&iacute; claim they cannot deal with it because joyriders can escape through certain lanes and so on. By getting appropriate responses from the local authority, we could see improvements being made. The composition of the committee was not perfect, but it brought the key players together. There was an air of responsibility between them to ensure that they were delivering their part of the deal to make a real improvement. Having experienced it, I endorse fully the issue of policing committees.</P>
      <P>While we do not have a formal structure for policing committees, they exist in an informal way. In Clondalkin, there are two safety forums which were established by local communities. They engage with garda&iacute; and local representatives every month or six weeks. They tackle the issue of anti-social behaviour, joyriding and so on. The meetings are well attended by garda&iacute; from the highest to the lowest level in the area. Local people feel that they are getting their point across directly to the Garda and are getting a direct response. On the other hand, garda&iacute; get information on what is happening in the area which gives them an opportunity to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill sets out, in a general way, the various roles and responsibilities of the Garda and so on. Garda&iacute; have recently brought to my attention that in some areas, they experience difficulty at weekends securing search warrants. This is often due to the difficulty in getting to a judge. From an operational point of view, the timing of obtaining a search warrant can be crucial. I suggest a garda of senior rank, witnessed by a peace commissioner, might be able to issue a warrant, or perhaps a similar system could be applied. We do not have continuous access, particularly at weekends, to judges to obtain search warrants. I do not know if another mechanism could be introduced where warrants could be secured. That might be examined in Part II.</P>
      <P>Section 26 refers to charges for services. The most obvious example of such charges is the security escort for banks. While I appreciate that <Col N="1558"/>the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform secures a higher charge than the Department of Defence for the services provided during cash escorts, I am not sure whether it is provided at a commercial rate or is subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is heavily subsidised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>In any event, it should be provided at a commercial rate. The cash escort businesses and the banks benefit from this. When an ordinary member of the community withdraws money, he or she is charged for doing so.</P>
      <P>Another area related to charges for services is that of entertainment venues. Most of these venues employ rigorous internal security arrangements such as closed circuit television, security staff and so on. It is unfair that these venues close their doors at a given time and the patrons pour onto the streets to be supervised by the Garda. Perhaps these late night venues, which levy significant entrance charges, should make a contribution towards the provision of additional Garda numbers. It is most often at that time of night such incidents are reported.</P>
      <P>Another key objective of the Bill is to establish the independent Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission to replace the existing complaints board. At times, people have called into question the current system for dealing with complaints against members of the force. There has perhaps been a lack of confidence in the board which, in turn, pointed to problems concerning the current arrangements. A new mechanism is thus needed to ensure openness, transparency and, more importantly, public confidence in the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>Of all the constituents who have come to my office, I have never heard a complaint from them against an individual garda. When people complain about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is because they did not respond quickly enough. I have checked this matter and my office has never come across an individual complaint against a garda, even though it is a busy constituency office. We need to be balanced in our views on this issue when discussing the proposed mechanism for making complaints. Complaints against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not an everyday occurrence by any means.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill&rsquo;s provision for the establishment of joint policing committees, which is one of the most hopeful aspects of the legislation. While serious levels of crime are being dealt with effectively, other crime, including anti-social behaviour, is not being dealt with adequately as far as the public is concerned. The only way we will ever deal with such problems is by having our communities engage fully in resolving them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Curran for sharing some of his time with me. I join many of my colleagues in welcoming this Bill, which constitutes the first major reform of the Garda S&iacute;och<Col N="1559"/>&aacute;na since the 1920s. The Minister and his departmental officials ought to be commended for their work on this substantial legislation, which provides for the modern management and administration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In this day and age, as we all know, such large organisations constantly need to reform themselves and examine their work practices in a modern context. The Bill will go a long way towards putting in place structures to allow the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to operate in such a modern context by employing modern management techniques which are vital in any large-scale, evolving organisation.</P>
      <P>The legislation also recognises for the first time that garda&iacute; are not simply involved in enforcing justice on the streets but in many instances provide a service to the community. This is not just the case in crime prevention or detection but in many other areas also. As service providers, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requires appropriate administration techniques to manage an organisation which provides such a valuable community service.</P>
      <P>The part of the Bill that deals with management and administration also deals with the relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, specifically through the Garda Commissioner. This is a welcome development because for far too long, over many decades, there was a blurring of the lines of command between the Commissioner and the Minister. This in turn led to much questioning of the relative roles of both individuals, the Minister of the day and the Garda Commissioner. There were suggestions that there had been a politicisation of the force in years gone by. Thankfully, however, those suggestions are not currently made in public discourse. Nonetheless, it is a welcome development that the respective roles of the Minister, the Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be placed on a clear and firm statutory footing as a result of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Another major aspect of the Bill, as identified by Deputy Curran, is the establishment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission, which has been long awaited. A number of high profile cases and incidents over the past few years have unfortunately undermined the trust and confidence which people generally have in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The proposed commission will be helpful in maintaining that trust and, I hope, enhancing it in future, as well as proving the public&rsquo;s co-operation upon which garda&iacute; depend every day. As I said, garda&iacute; are not just enforcers of justice but also service providers for the community. In this role, they need an independent body through which their work can be monitored and, if necessary, investigated independently of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Bill is strong on this point.</P>
      <P>Although it did not appear in the first legislative draft, I welcome in particular the aspects of the Bill which will allow the inspectorate to investigate matters of its own volition arising from <Col N="1560"/>complaints about, or information that may come to hand concerning, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That is a key aspect of the legislation in that it enables the inspectorate not just to rely on complaints. As we know from recent tribunals and other high profile cases, some people may not wish to make complaints. However, information may sometimes come to hand from a third party on a confidential basis that needs to be investigated.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the Bill&rsquo;s proposals to modernise practices in the force, it is important to put on record that the vast majority of garda&iacute;, often serving in difficult circumstances when the security of the State was under threat, have rendered an enormous service to the country over the years. I support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that role. Its members generally have earned the trust and confidence of the community at large and they are to be commended for having done so.</P>
      <P>If I can be parochial for a moment, I compliment garda&iacute; in the Limerick division on the excellent work they have done over the years, including recently when serious problems arose concerning gangland crime.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the Bill deals with joint policing committees, about which previous speakers have commented. I welcome the introduction of a collaboration between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities. I have been of the view for a long time that while garda&iacute; have to deal with the manifestation of crime, in many cases local authorities, and nobody else, have been the cause of crime that is so prevalent throughout the country. This is particularly so concerning anti-social behaviour which may be caused by poor planning, bad housing and the lack of appropriate facilities for residents in local authority accommodation. All local authorities have made such decisions but the results of some of them have been absolutely disastrous. The Bill&rsquo;s proposal for a new connection between local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only be for the greater good. There has been much debate on whether there should be local community involvement on the new policing committees. For the time being, however, the Minister has rejected that idea. I ask the Minister of State to accept that even if the Minister is not minded to allow a community involvement, he should at least provide those joint policing committees with the statutory power to invite in at some stage, on a temporary basis, community leaders who can assist them in their duties.</P>
      <P>Because we are dealing with the garda&iacute;, it is appropriate to say a few words about anti-social behaviour, a topical theme. The matter will be addressed in the Criminal Justice Bill and we will discuss it then, but it is important to mention it in the context of the current undermining of Garda morale by anti-social behaviour. The garda&iacute; I meet are dealing with serious gangland issues in Limerick, with multiple murders and with people who will stop at nothing to undermine the garda&iacute;. While they deal with such issues they cannot deal with those which concern the vast majority of people, namely anti-social behaviour, public <Col N="1561"/>order offences and so on, issues discussed at length in the House in recent weeks. That has undermined Garda morale and needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>On a recent cold, wet, winter night I attended a meeting with over 300 Limerick citizens acutely concerned with anti-social behaviour. Garda&iacute; repeatedly told me they felt powerless to address the issue because they could not criminalise young people of ten, 11, 12, 13 and 14 as it is not a criminal offence to &ldquo;merely&rdquo; apply graffiti, bully children going to and from school, break windows and so on. These are not &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; which can be dealt with in the normal course of events by the District Court, which is why I welcome the proposed introduction of anti-social behaviour orders. They will not be a panacea, but garda&iacute; tell me they need to be able to give a &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; or clear signal to people who propose to engage in anti-social behaviour that they have been warned, and that if they continue to engage in it they will enter criminal rather than civil spheres. It is right that the garda&iacute; are given such support.</P>
      <P>I had hoped to address many other issues but have not got the time. I will address them when the Criminal Justice Bill comes before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. All in the House recognise the need for new, all-embracing legislation dealing with the organisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we welcome the opportunity of recognising the service the force has given to the State since its foundation.</P>
      <P>We need to consider the detail of this Bill. Those on this side of the House, at least, need to argue about some of what has been proposed not being what is needed, and wrong prioritisation of issues regarding what can and should be done. We have already had a long debate on this Bill but it has facilitated further information on what modern policing means in Ireland. Sometimes, such information is not what we like to hear. While the garda&iacute; are entrusted by us to enforce the highest standards of law, and the law itself, it is unrealistic to expect a pristine police force because a force reflects the society it serves.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we are exposed in our police force to some of the worst reflections of the behaviour which exists in society in general, and as public representatives we need to know how that can be minimised, eliminated and guarded against so it does not re-occur in the future. Those who listened to the re-enactment of the Morris tribunal would wonder why there is not a wider debate about what seem to be systemic problems regarding the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na promotion system, the perceived need to provide high-profile so-called crime convictions which turn out not to involve crimes, and the development of networks in terms of how people can push themselves forward as individuals within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not responded properly to the Morris <Col N="1562"/>tribunal findings. It is not enough for him or the Government to say that we should wait for the tribunal&rsquo;s conclusions. What has emerged so far is worrying enough and requires an immediate response. The Minister should be challenged on why he is not reacting more strongly to the revelations.</P>
      <P>In the past weeks an audit has been published by the human rights working group. Regarding ever-changing Irish society in terms of its make-up, the report says emphatically that the Garda has difficulty responding to problems which can lead to institutional racism. The Garda Commissioner has fully accepted the findings of the audit and has put in place a timetable for ensuring its recommendations are implemented. Unfortunately, however, the timetable runs to the end of 2007. Questions need to be asked regarding why the prioritisation is being made at Garda Commissioner level in the manner it is being made. It seems to me and many others that the recommendations should be implemented immediately. An opportunity is being lost to stop some of the attitudes highlighted by the independent audit becoming entrenched.</P>
      <P>When I read press reporting of the audit I was reminded of a sketch from a British television comedy show in the 1980s, &ldquo;Not the Nine O&rsquo;Clock News&rdquo;, which featured two British policemen talking to each other. One was being scolded by a superior officer for arresting a person on more than 150 occasions on ridiculous trumped-up charges such as impersonating a human being, crossing a footpath in a reckless fashion, and breaking and entering an egg. This was satire, reflecting the existing attitudes in the British police force at the time. We have not properly adapted to the changing Ireland in failing to anticipate that such attitudes could and perhaps do exist, and accepting that proper safeguards can and should be put in place. The audit has played a useful role in that regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should, in terms of his relationship with the Garda Commissioner and his accountability to this House, allow us the opportunity to see how the reform timetable is being enforced and give us regular reports on whether the problems in the police force continue to exist or are being finally stamped out.</P>
      <P>I will move on to more positive areas when I get the following off my chest. An unfortunate aspect of debating the need to make the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the best possible police force it can be is the sometimes negative attitude taken by garda representative bodies, with any type of criticism seen as requiring a negative response. Most members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na believe in and support the need for reforms, and are willing to participate in them. We need a climate whereby such support exists. Otherwise, the attitude we have seen taken in the past by various Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the ordinary membership of the Garda S&iacute;och<Col N="1563"/>&aacute;na might bring about difficulties. We have seen that in instances such as the &ldquo;blue &rsquo;flu&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The central proposal in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is to establish an ombudsman commission to deal with complaints against garda&iacute;. Many members of the Opposition feel that a three-person commission dilutes and diffuses its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to denigrate my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who is sitting in for the Government side, but I had hoped the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, would have remained in the Chamber. I was going to use him as an example because as part of his brief with the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, he was responsible for the introduction of an ombudsman for children. In that regard the same debate occurred on the question of whether a person or a commission should head a well resourced and well staffed office. The recommendations in respect of an ombudsman for children came down heavily on the side of it being one person with a focus, someone who would take on responsibility for how the office would run and on whom accountability would focus. The Government is sending mixed messages in saying there can and should be one ombudsman in terms of administrative affairs and one for children, but that for the Garda there must be an ombudsman commission with three members.</P>
      <P>There is also a question about whether the powers given to this commission will be sufficiently effective. They will not exist to the level of the police ombudsman in Northern Ireland. It is a strange irony that in terms of inspections and on-the-spot inspections a body such as the Council of Europe committee for the prevention of torture has rights to access any Garda station in the country at any time, yet this power will not exist for the ombudsman commission in terms of its regulatory role with the Garda.</P>
      <P>The proposal for the joint committees is welcome. Previous speakers mentioned the problems of anti-social behaviour. Another Cork colleague, Deputy Kelleher, is in the Chamber. We are all aware of the situation of my Green Party colleague in Cork city with regard to community policing and the anti-social behaviour in his part of the city. This is not unusual to him or his locality. It exists in every community. The difficulty is that highlighting the incidence of anti-social behaviour seems to invite other anti-social behaviour. The role that the police can and should play in this is a legitimate part of this debate.</P>
      <P>The debate comes down to the fundamental aspects of the nature of policing. The Government, in this debate and throughout its term of office, continues to trot out statistics about more garda&iacute; and more resources. However, because of <Col N="1564"/>how operations have changed within the Garda, people do not meet or see garda&iacute;. Despite the additional garda&iacute;, on a <i>per capita</i> basis numbers are fewer because we have a greater population and proportionately fewer garda&iacute;. Those garda&iacute; we have do more work behind the scenes and less on the street. Unless we get that balance right, public confidence in the ability to have effective policing will be badly undermined.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very unclear as to who will be part of the joint committees and how they will be reported. More importantly, it is not at all clear as to how effective they may be. There are several layers of so-called consultation on many aspects of Government business, both at local government and national level. As public representatives few of us have confidence in those consultative procedures because they are not consultations. They are talking shops and have some legal recognition, but there is no process involved in many of these bodies whereby people can go in, register complaints and see those complaints acted on. The mechanisms do not seem to be in place to act on such complaints. If the policing committees only exist in that form, I am dubious as to whether the type of public support needed to make them effective will exist. Similar bodies exist in Britain and Northern Ireland and seem to be effective. However, what is being proposed here and what exists there seem to be different animals. There is a reluctance to go the extra inch to make bodies that would be effective and inspire public confidence.</P>
      <P>On the role of the Garda and young people, it is unfortunate that the benchmarks that seem important in the Department of the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are the moneys spent on the creation of additional prison spaces. There does not appear to be any balance in his equation as to how that money can or should be better spent.</P>
      <P>In the debate on additional Garda places there does not appear to be any debate on how the juvenile liaison scheme can be strengthened, whether more people should be involved at that level or whether there should be more face to face interaction with young people. It is recognised that young men from their teenage years to their mid-20s commit the largest proportion of crime and that these form the largest proportion of our prison population. It is no accident that the propensity to commit crime and to draw these people into the cycle of crime in their communities is considerably lessened where there is interaction and intervention and when resources are allocated. However, we seem not to want that type of debate, to make those choices or put the resources in place.</P>
      <P>In my experience as a youth worker I found it frustrating that even when initiatives were put in place, such as divergence schemes with regard to joyriding, they were always on a pilot basis and there was always uncertainty about their future. In many instances the schemes were not continued beyond a pilot basis. Using the clich&eacute; of <Col N="1565"/>Tony Blair, if we are serious about being tough on crime and on the causes of crime, we must examine both sides of this social equation. I do not believe the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is capable of doing that. He seems to have a particular myopia in terms of what crime is and how it should be tackled. Unfortunately, how he proposes to structure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is part of that myopia.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s remark on the Order of Business the other day was also unfortunate. To be fair, it was probably meant in jest. However, the implication that &ldquo;roughing up&rdquo; a young person is an acceptable form of policing is not acceptable. I accept it might be acceptable to many people in society. In terms of wider politics it might even be politically popular to say this. However, the essence of policing is that the Garda must earn respect and use respect to keep respect. The use of violence in any form by those who uphold the law invites, encourages and incites violence from people whom we are trying to discourage from breaking the law. It brings about an unending cycle we do not want to see in society. I do not believe this was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention, but such remarks, even when made in jest, can be taken seriously. I hope the Taoiseach takes up the opportunity in debate to clear up that impression. The Green Party supports many aspects of this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are concerned about the Bill&rsquo;s provisions relating to the ombudsman commission and the joint committees, but the legislation can and should be improved. The philosophy underpinning policing should be the subject of ongoing debate. The Bill plays a role in this regard but the debate should not cease once it has been passed.</P>
      <P>We are well served by our police force and we are probably better served in this regard than other countries, but that does not mean complacency should set in when things go wrong within the force. Unfortunately, many things are going wrong, even among the junior ranks, which are not being responded to appropriately. The Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should demonstrate greater political courage in tackling these issues to ensure proper public confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate, which is timely in the context of the broader debate on the role of the Garda in society and societal changes. Reference has been made to anti-social behaviour and other issues, to which I will refer later. There is a strong bond of trust between the Garda and the public. The Garda has served the State well since its inception and during difficult times the force&rsquo;s loyalty to the State was very much to the fore in preserving law and order and in ensuring the integrity of the State&rsquo;s institutions was protected at all times. That must be highlighted continually.</P>
      <P>Comparisons have been made with other police forces. As a Member, I travel around the world <Col N="1566"/>and meet other parliamentarians. Following these contacts, it is evident the Garda has great integrity and few people can claim it has experienced endemic corruption, unlike other forces, even within the European Union. The payment of on-the-spot fines has led to corruption as drivers have avoided speeding fines by putting a few euro in their driving licences when they are stopped. Such a practice cannot be associated with the Garda.</P>
      <P>The force&rsquo;s achievements must be highlighted, particularly in regard to crime. I pay tribute to Mr. Adrian Culligan and all Garda members in Cork who have over the years remained steadfast in the fight against organised crime and criminality in general. As a result, Cork experiences few gangland murders and the heroin epidemic and attendant crime has been avoided. This is the result of the hands-on approach of the Garda in Cork, which has ensured this insidious epidemic has not spread to the city. The heroin epidemic has caused major problems in Dublin and it has spread to provincial towns. The heroin drug trade, which is the source of organised crime, gangland killings and turf wars is not evident in Cork.</P>
      <P>However, abuse of other drugs is a problem in Cork as in other areas. That must be tackled not only by the Garda but through education and encouraging people to stay away from drugs. Strong advertising campaigns are needed similar to that used to counteract the consumption of alcohol by those under the legal age and binge drinking so that the insidious, negative aspects of drug use are highlighted. We cannot be complacent, but I acknowledge the efforts of the Garda in Cork in this regard.</P>
      <P>I refer to the Garda ombudsman commission. The debate is a worthwhile exercise. A number of tribunals of inquiry into the workings of the Garda in certain parts of the State have been held and they have dented the public&rsquo;s confidence in bringing forward complaints against Garda members. If people are to take a positive view of the Garda, an outside body such as the proposed commission to investigate complaints against members of the force is necessary. The commission will benefit the Garda as well as the public, as it will ensure transparency and accountability. There is a perception that people are afraid to make complaints against members of the Garda. This is divisive and damaging in the context of community policing, to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>People should have confidence in the Garda but, equally, they should be able to make a complaint against a member of the force without fear of recrimination, safe in the knowledge that the complaint will be investigated thoroughly and independently and, more importantly, that when findings are produced, actions will be taken. The commission&rsquo;s precursor was the Garda complaints board, which stated that changes would have to be made in the way complaints against the Garda were addressed.</P><Col N="1567"/>
      <P>As society changes, difficulties are experienced, particularly anti-social behaviour in urban areas, which is an increasing problem. To be successful in addressing anti-social behaviour, the individuals involved must be turned away from this behaviour and from criminality generally at an early stage and the Garda must examine its community policing function in this context. An assistant Garda commissioner should be appointed with responsibility for community policing. Such policing is effective but, unfortunately, it is a little haphazard because strong structures are not in place. Garda&iacute; involved in community policing point out that if they want to advance their careers and put themselves forward for promotion, they cannot engage in community policing for long periods because promotion will not come their way. A group similar to the proposed traffic corps should be established for community policing. This will allow officers to become heavily involved in the community. They could live in the community while availing of promotional opportunities and they would not be seen as the bridesmaids of the Garda.</P>
      <P>Garda&iacute; who are involved in all facets of community life, including sports clubs, help to create a strong bond between the Garda and the public. Anti-social behaviour is experienced in estates throughout the State and there is evidence that a Garda presence is lacking in them. Garda&iacute; are only seen at night in a car or if there is a major disturbance. However, they must be visible within the community at all times if this problem is to be addressed. That is why the community policing issue must be explored in its entirety.</P>
      <P>Teachers can pinpoint at an early stage youngsters who will drop out of school and will end up in court and prison. An integrated approach involving garda&iacute;, home-school liaison officers and school attendance officers could pinpoint these young people at an early stage. That could happen if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the community policing system, was closely involved in sporting and soccer clubs and also attended schools. I remember visiting schools where a police officer would speak and outline the workings of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. However, that is done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I speak of targeting police at communities where there are difficulties and putting forward the positive side of their calling. We do not want them to be seen as the enemy, but unfortunately in some communities that is the case. We have had a rise in vigilantism in certain parts of the country, although that is obviously being encouraged by certain elements for other reasons of which we are all aware. Wherever there is a vacuum, this issue can arise.</P>
      <P>The recruitment campaign is evident at present, and there is talk of increasing the police force to 14,000. The majority of new members should be involved in community policing. That would be seen as a positive opportunity for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na too. I do not like the idea that one becomes involved in community <Col N="1568"/>policing for a few years but then gets out of it quickly and returns to the mainstream to deal with and investigate crime to advance one&rsquo;s career. That must be addressed.</P>
      <P>There is no continuity in community policing. A member of the force is appointed as a community police officer for several years, a vacancy arises elsewhere, and that person is moved on again. If there were a community policing structure in every division and a promotional pyramid right up to the position of assistant commissioner with special responsibility for the field, that would have a great impact in the years following.</P>
      <P>I have referred to anti-social behaviour. In Chapter 4 there is a reference to it regarding co-operation with local authorities and arrangements for obtaining the views of the public. There is not a public representative in this House who has not been on to the local sergeant or superintendent regarding problems in estates. Often the problems are because of bad planning and design as well as high unemployment and other issues that eat into the fabric of society. Local authorities&rsquo; housing policies must be examined if we are to have proper community policing, something that I hope will become more evident in Government policy as we move forward and recruit more garda&iacute;. Designing communities and putting people from the same demographic, age profile and family make-up into a single area while moving others elsewhere does nothing for the integration and cohesiveness of society.</P>
      <P>I have long made a proposal to the city council in Cork which it has taken on board to a certain extent. This was not simply because I proposed it since it was obvious to all public representatives. The proposal was that every area should have an integrated mix of elderly people, lone parents, single people and families because, for example, it would give support to a lone parent who would be able to get assistance and advice from a person who has raised a family. The supports that existed long ago are missing in some areas because they consist of one demographic or group. That is something local authorities have been slow to address. They continually build housing units in the same style and manner as they have done for years. There has been a slight change but such change must take place more rapidly. In future, when allocating houses, local authorities must take into account the population make-up and consider whether there might be too many of a certain age profile or family make-up in an area. This should be done in a positive manner to ensure a proper make-up in communities everywhere.</P>
      <P>It has been proven beyond doubt that where one has a group of similar people from whatever age profile, it creates great difficulties. For example, if all the people in an area are elderly, they cannot take advantage of the assistance of a young person when going shopping, getting the bus or keeping the garden clean. All these issues depend on people interacting with other age pro<Col N="1569"/>files. The local authorities must address that. Section 33 reads:</P>
      <P LI="1">A local authority shall, in performing its functions, have regard to the need to take such steps as may be practicable to assist in the reduction of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within its area of responsibility.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That is defined in Chapter 4, but local authorities should be instructed, through Government policy or otherwise, to ensure that the points that I have highlighted are taken into account when they make policy decisions on housing, the development of new estates or the rezoning of land.</P>
      <P>On the debate regarding anti-social behaviour orders, there is no doubt that orders must be addressed on several fronts. I will travel to Leicester in a few weeks to view at first hand anti-social behaviour orders that have been working there. On the face of it, where they have been enforced and resources given to the police and the local authorities, as in Leicester, they seem to have been positive and to have had a major impact on the reduction of anti-social activity. If we are serious about addressing such behaviour, we must introduce some proposals that will remove the thugs and hooligans.</P>
      <P>Many people miss this point. It is important that, if one is dealing with the &ldquo;gurrier&rdquo; element in a group of people &mdash; if there are 15 on an estate, only one or two might cause major problems &mdash; by and large, they intimidate other younger people and bully them into getting involved in anti-social activity. It is therefore not simply a matter of dealing with the individual but about ensuring that, by removing someone and dealing with him or her fairly, one discourages others from getting involved. We are all aware of situations where one or two hard men in an area bully others into getting involved in such things as under age drinking, binge drinking and, perhaps, drugs and petty crime. The same is true of anti-social behaviour and we must address that quickly.</P>
      <P>We are not talking about people between the ages of 19 and 23 but those who are 12, 13 or 14. They make life a misery for large sections of communities, especially in urban areas where gangs of youths congregate in corners of estates, alleyways or outside community centres and playgrounds to intimidate others. The argument is always made that we do not have enough facilities for young people, and we certainly always strive to ensure we have more. That said, there are situations where youths hang around outside community centres where free games might be available to them along with floodlit soccer pitches and tennis and basketball courts, yet they are outside causing problems, intimidating young people and discouraging them from partaking in such activity.</P>
      <P>On Chapter 7, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s international service through co-operation with other police forces and the United Nations has expanded in recent years and many members of <Col N="1570"/>the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have travelled overseas to work with the United Nations in Cyprus, Kosovo and elsewhere. They give a very positive profile to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na abroad. More importantly, the expertise they gain through learning from other police forces should be encouraged. We also welcome the idea of members of the PSNI being able to work in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Republic because they have vast experience of other forms of criminality which are prevalent there. With the advance of terrorism and other forms of organised criminality worldwide, they would also be able to give advice and bring expertise to bear on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in dealing with such activity.</P>
      <P>I wish the Bill well. I hope the proposed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission will reassure those who have complained that the public has a lack of confidence and trust in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda deserves the restoration of trust in the way it has served communities and the country as a whole since its inception.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to address community policing issues in a serious and coherent manner. If we are to establish a traffic corps, perhaps we should consider establishing a branch of the Garda that has a positive community policing role. Garda&iacute; should be allowed to take pride in that role, build expertise in the area of community policing over a number of years, benefit from promotional prospects within the community policing service, build a strong bond with educational and sporting bodies, for example, by visiting schools, and ensure that there are no barriers between the Garda and the public. Such a system of community policing would ensure that young people have a healthy respect for the force and understand that the Garda patrols local areas to ensure that communities are safe from anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>I hope some of the points I have made will be taken on board, not only in the context of the Bill before the House but also in the context of the Government&rsquo;s future policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004. I compliment the Garda on the service it has given to the community over the decades. The force will celebrate its centenary within a few years and I hope that will be a joyous occasion. Some wise decisions were taken when the Garda was established in the early 1920s, following the foundation of the State. Those who decided, at a time of terrible conflict and civil war, that the force should be unarmed were far-sighted. They established a force of which we can be proud.</P>
      <P>I should declare an interest at this point &mdash; my father was one of the early members of the Garda, having joined the force in the 1920s. He served in the force for 43 years, until he was 65 years of age, which would not be possible nowadays. He continued to give active service until that time. It has been decreed that garda&iacute; now <Col N="1571"/>have to retire at the age of 57, irrespective of the skills they can offer to the force or the community. I grew up in a rural community, where my father worked as a policeman. The local garda&iacute; were very much part of the community and knew about everything that happened there. The level of crime there was non-existent. I attribute the lack of crime to the fact that the police were so involved in local communities, as I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Acting Chairman, Deputy Sherlock, is of the same generation as me and I am sure he learned all about the blessed trinity of the father, the son and the holy spirit, just as I did. The blessed trinity of the parish priest, the school master and the Garda sergeant was much more relevant to those of us living in rural Ireland in those times. Such people comprised the active force in our lives and communities. If one stepped out of line in any way, such people would be charged with putting one back in one&rsquo;s place.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Garda on the success of the difficult job it has done over the years. We should be particularly proud of the job it did in the 1970s. We could well have been overrun if successive Ministers of that era had not taken a firm stand and if the members of the Garda had not put their lives at risk to save our country. We should not forget the garda&iacute; who lost their lives in the service of the State, while preserving the peace and prosperity of its citizens.</P>
      <P>Times are changing dramatically. The management structures which existed in the Garda in the past will not continue to work in modern times. The management techniques and resources which are used need to be refocused and replaced with more modern methods which are geared to the needs of contemporary society. Some forms of crime are perpetrated by those using the facilities of the electronic age. I refer to theft facilitated by the scanning of credit cards, for example. Some forms of behaviour which might not superficially be seen as criminal can do tremendous damage by harming communities.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Defence to a problem that has been brought to my attention. As a man of the people, I am sure the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, has encountered the problem in question. I refer to the establishment of a new website, <i>www.ratemyteachers.ie</i>. I do not know what society can do to make the website illegal. I recently received a letter about the website from somebody I know very well. The letter demonstrates the tremendous hurt felt by a man who is heavily involved in the life of his community and is doing a good job. People like the Acting Chairman, the Minister, Deputy Kelleher and me face the challenge of responding to such people, who are doing a good job in society. We need to continue to support them and to preserve their work ethic.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote from the letter I received, which was sent by a man who has been teaching mathematics for 28 years. He refers to the school <Col N="1572"/>in which he works, the name of which I will not mention, as &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; and states that he was &ldquo;very contented&rdquo; in his chosen profession until the last few months. He continues:</P>
      <P LI="1">I would be widely accepted by my own teaching colleagues and the vast majority of my students as a teacher of the highest calibre. I treat all my students with respect, I have excellent class discipline, I prepare my work thoroughly, I give regular tests which are always returned the following day, I have a great sense of humour and engage in easy banter with my classes, my exam results are always above national average, I have always figured highly in extra curricular activities . . . . . I have always gone the extra mile for the students of this school without ever giving it a second thought. In the last week, my boss asked me to do something for the students outside of class time. I said no for the first time ever.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">My reputation and that of a number of my colleagues has been shredded by the comments made by anonymous people on this cheap entertainment website . . . . . Personally, I feel betrayed and disillusioned. l have made myself a promise which will be very difficult to fulfil, that I will do nothing extracurricular for my students until the day this website is removed from our system. I will still give 100% in my classwork as I have always done . . . . .</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">In the last two days, I have heard of instances where students have openly stated that they would get their own back on teachers after a run-in with them. In one case, the teacher concerned had had a clash with a student in a junior hurling match outside of school. Are we looking at the appalling scenario of students bullying teachers into going easy on them in school for fear of retribution? Will our young teachers court popularity so as to get good ratings?</P>
      <P FLI="0">The teacher in question went on to quote some of the personal comments which have been made about teachers on the website. Indeed, the website now features personal comments about students. Some terrible comments have been made about some female students.</P>
      <P>I do not know what we can do about this modern phenomenon &mdash; my hands are tied. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, will draw attention at Cabinet level to this matter to see what can be done. It is outrageous that such behaviour is tolerated in this day and age. Perhaps it is an example of something modern that we have failed to keep pace with. We are unable to keep up with modern technology. We need to examine how we can outlaw websites of this nature, or at least do something about them. The presence of such websites will lead to the loss of the support of teachers who are currently prepared to go the extra mile. They will become disillusioned and start to withdraw the care they are giving at present.</P><Col N="1573"/>
      <P>This problem is found in many walks of life, as I realised while speaking to a concerned community garda the other day. I agree with everything Deputy Kelleher said about community policing. He was absolutely correct.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The consumer strategy group presented its final report to me on 2 March 2005. The report contains more than 30 recommendations involving a variety of Departments and agencies. I am currently considering the report and its recommendations in conjunction with my colleagues in Government. I expect to publish the report and to announce my plans to progress the recommendations in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister elaborate on the contents of the report since he has had it since 2 March? Why has it taken the Minister so long to publish the report and to let us know the precise nature of these recommendations to ensure we have a consumer policy at Government level for the first time?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>When a report comes to Government it should be seriously considered and there are significant recommendations in the report that require a collective Government response. I want to be in a position when the report is published to indicate the Government&rsquo;s position on a number of headline issues. There are around 30 recommendations, some of which can be progressed over time.</P>
        <P>The report supports the view that there is a need for a strong institutional voice for the consumer in terms of policy formulation and makes the point that such a voice is absent at present. It has strong opinions on the Groceries Order and takes a position on it that is widely known &mdash; it will recommend that the order be lifted. In addition, it recommends how the proposed consumer voice could represent the consumer in submissions to regulators. I want to deal with such issues with my Cabinet colleagues.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1574"/>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister knows that in this House, Fine Gael has proposed a method by which there can be a consumer voice &mdash; the consumer rights enforcer. The Government voted this down on the basis that it would bring forward its own proposals. That is taking a considerable length of time and in the meantime, consumers are very frustrated with the level of unwarranted cost increases that are little more than deliberate extortion in many sectors. To prevent any more frustration on the part of consumers, will the Minister adopt an ombudsman approach for them so they can have the opportunity to make complaints and seek redress where possible? The institutional consumer voice the Minister mentioned should not take long to set up because he has the full support of this side of the House for such a proposal.</P>
        <P>Did the Minister present the consumer strategy group report to the Cabinet yesterday? Why has it not been published? Are there problems at Cabinet level on agreeing an overall consumer strategy in accordance with the report?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been presented to Cabinet and is being deliberated on at Cabinet level. It is still on the Cabinet agenda. That is normal; we cannot expect Cabinet to endorse reports on the nod. People want to interrogate the proposals and will have perspectives on them. It is being seriously considered.</P>
        <P>Only last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, introduced the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill in the Seanad. That Bill incorporates seven sections that raise the level of penalties in the core consumer legislation enforced by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, such as the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, the Consumer Information Act 1978, the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Act 1995, the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996, the Restrictive Practices Act 1972, the Prices Act 1958, the Consumer Credit Act 1995. The Director of Consumer Affairs who had raised the issue of the low level of penalties in consumer legislation in two consecutive annual reports recommended all of that.</P>
        <P>Inflation is running at 2.1% as a result of a range of concerted Government actions. We have made significant progress on holding back the tide of inflation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister mentioned the legislation introduced in the Seanad last week. It is very unusual to insert miscellaneous sections into a Bill to deal with the many consumer interests listed.</P>
        <P>Why has it taken so long for the Government to adjudicate on the Groceries Order when it has substantially increased the amount of money a person can be fined for a breach of the order in this new legislation? The fine now stands at up to &euro;60,000, up from &euro;1,000. Surely it is accepted Government practice that if the fines for the <Col N="1575"/>breach of an order are being increased, the order itself will be retained.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some public commentators tried to make that point recently but they were being disingenuous. This Bill covers a broad tranche of consumer legislation at the behest of the Director of Consumer Affairs. All of the Acts I listed are affected by the increase in penalties and fines. In no way, however, can that be interpreted as an indication of the Government&rsquo;s position on retaining or abolishing the Groceries Order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why were the fines increased?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We increased the fines across a raft of consumer legislation. That is standard practice for any existing legislation. It does not indicate anything. The Attorney General has advised that in the event of repealing the Groceries Order, primary legislation would be required. That option will be considered once the Government deals with the Groceries Order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an unsatisfactory method of dealing with it &mdash; inserting a miscellaneous section into a Bill that has nothing to do with it.</P>

	<P>Arising from paragraph 12.4 of the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, and to assist in the preparation of proposals for consideration by Government, the labour inspectorate prepared a discussion document on its mandate and resourcing. This comprehensive document was circulated to the social partners in January of this year so that their views could be obtained.</P>
        <P>The discussion document covered all issues that impact on the operation of the labour inspectorate, ranging from the legislative framework right through to the operational aspects and staff development. It also looked at a range of possibilities around the operation of the labour inspectorate and offered a spectrum of possibilities, ranging from a compliance regime where the initiative would move more toward the complainant, with the labour inspectorate offering support, to a model where the right of initiative would be with the labour inspectorate, which would have a hands-on approach.</P><Col N="1576"/>
        <P>The labour inspectorate, and the individuals therein, are very much to the fore in seeking compliance with employment rights legislation and, as such, interact at a range of levels in the workplace, i.e., with migrant workers, young people, the low-paid and the full range of management within the workplace. Accordingly, the inspectorate requires particular skills and this need has been addressed in the recent past through specialised training provided in the context of the performance management and development system operating in the Department. Examples of the structured and formalised training delivered specifically to the labour inspectorate in recent years would range from courtroom skills, competency development packages, specialised driver training, racism awareness and the safe pass training scheme to enable them operate on building sites. A particular emphasis has been maintained on team building and working within the inspectorate, given that it operates in a team format with work distributed accordingly.</P>
        <P>The discussion document has been well received among the social partners, with some comments received and others awaited, although initial favourable views have been made known. An interactive phase on the discussion document will get under way shortly whereby the range of choices will be narrowed down.</P>
        <P>The inspectorate does a difficult job in an efficient and courteous manner and it always projects the Department&rsquo;s core principles of seeking to ensure compliance with the employment rights entitlements of workers, regardless of whether they are Irish or migrant workers. Compliance is achieved by means of advice, guidance, restitution of moneys due, with &euro;486,000 recovered in 2004 and, ultimately, prosecutions, with 14 initiated in 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcomed the appointment of the Minister of State not so long ago, but I am afraid he has reverted to Department speak very quickly after his appointment. I ask him to address the questions asked in my priority question. Is it not a fact, and will the Minister not acknowledge, that the labour inspectorate in this internal review stated that it was prevented from properly policing the minimum wage and other employment rights? Is that not a vindication of a position I have taken over many months with him and his Department? Is it not now the case that there is an unanswerable case for a significant increase in the number of labour inspectors? When will we see those labour inspectors on the ground? Is it not a fact also that in the review the Minister acknowledges exists the labour inspectors said they had seldom if ever had their full complement of 21 available to them? Is it not almost a scandal that in a workforce now in excess of 2 million, 21 people, even if all were on active duty at any given time, are expected to enforce an increasingly complicated labour market with increasingly complicated labour laws? Is it not a fact that the dereliction of the <Col N="1577"/>Department in providing adequate policing has led directly to the climate of tolerance of exploitation we have witnessed recently?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s report was circulated to the social partners in January. As the Deputy will be aware, and as I said previously in response to his questions, up to last year the number of labour inspectors was 17. There were some difficulties last year because some of them were involved in work associated with the European Presidency. The number was increased following the mid-term review to 21 inspectors and it was announced last week that it will increase to 32 in total, which in terms of the number available in 2004 is a substantial increase. I acknowledge that the trade unions, particularly SIPTU, have argued strongly for an increase in the number of labour inspectors and I am glad the Government is able to accede to that request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister acknowledge that the proof of the pudding is what happens on the ground? Is it not a fact that the number of inspections dropped from 7,168 in 2003 to 5,160 last year, a decrease of approximately 2,000 inspections? Is it not a fact also that prosecutions have fallen from 20 in 2003 to 14 last year? We are going backwards and the notion that all is well or will soon be well is to give a nod if not a wink to the climate of exploitation that has been unearthed in cases such as that involving Gama workers or the Filipino woman who was expected to work for &euro;1 an hour on an Irish Ferries vessel operating out of my constituency. Will the Minister not acknowledge that there is an urgent need, in the increasingly complicated labour market in operation in our country, to have a vigorous policing system? Will he not acknowledge also that it is pointless in Members of this House enacting legislation to protect workers if there is little prospect of it being enforced on the ground?</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of lessons arise from the points made by Deputy Howlin and indeed adverted to by almost every Member of the House. There is no doubt that there are employers who will exploit their workers but a second and important lesson is that the labour inspectorate eventually catches up with those people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will acknowledge, as will anybody who is familiar with the law here, that one is required to present evidence in court and produce people who are prepared to give that evidence. That has been a difficulty heretofore but it is one that is gradually, and perhaps too <Col N="1578"/>slowly, being addressed. We need to send out a strong message from this House that those employers who continue to exploit their workers will eventually be brought to court and dealt with under the processes of law.</P>

        <Quest>his plans for the delivery of a national workplace strategy, as outlined in a recent report of the Forum on the Workplace of the Future, particularly in relation to the work and life balance aspects of the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12452/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach launched the Report of the Forum on the Workplace of the Future on 9 March 2005. The report contains 42 separate recommendations, which form the basis for a national workplace strategy. The strategy aims to create a climate conducive to supporting change and new forms of work organisation at national and organisational level.</P>
        <P>A high level group comprising senior representatives of a number of Departments, ICTU, IBEC and semi-State agencies and bodies will oversee the appropriate implementation of the national workplace strategy, including aspects relating to work-life balance. I have been asked by the Taoiseach to chair this group and I expect to convene a meeting of the group in the next few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report but we have heard the same comment for many years. In 1997, the OECD Ministers, including our own, said they would put a particular urgency on trying to bring flexible work arrangements and work-life balance into the workplace. In 2002, the then Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessor, said that providing flexibility was an essential part of the labour market supply. The Taoiseach and the Minister of State, at the launch of this latest report, again emphasised the competitive as well as social advantages we would get from providing a more flexible system, but what do we have in reality?</P>
        <P>A central part of policy of the Progressive Democrats friends of the Minister, Deputy Martin, is that we use schools from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to try to get some flexibility into our lives, without anyone having asked a child whether that might be a clever policy in the long run. The current Parental Leave Bill gives nothing in addition and could have been written by the worst elements of IBEC, who do not believe in providing any practical benefits for people. What practi<Col N="1579"/>cal legislative measure does the Minister intend to proceed with immediately to fulfil the commitment given in the seven years this Government has been in office? What other additional measures in terms of maternity leave, parental leave, flexible working conditions and ability to engage in term work and part-time work does the Minister of State intend to legislate for or is it all just talk from the Government on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the considerable work that was done in preparing this report and the fact that it arises from the deliberations of the social partners, among others. We sometimes fail to acknowledge the value of social partnership. I thought the Deputy might say that I was one of the least qualified people to be chairperson of the group in view of the type of unfriendly working hours Members of the House undertake on an ongoing basis. To some extent it is perhaps a matter of saying, &ldquo;Do as I say and not as I do&rdquo;. It is true, however, that the findings of the report set the agenda for the future in terms of work-life balance. We have a tradition of partnership which must be developed. It offers the opportunity to significantly improve work-life balance in the workplace. I welcome the fact that the social partners have been so proactive in this regard and reached a considerable level of agreement, particularly when one examines the 42 recommendations in the report. I look forward to implementing the recommendations which are directly within the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and to encouraging other Departments in the areas of their responsibilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>To be practical, on the issue of parental leave, for example, the Minister rightly said we have a social partnership model here. In the negotiation on that Bill, which is one aspect of the type of work-life balance arrangements we could set in place, IBEC almost ruled out any possible changes despite the fact that we are one of the few countries in the European Union that does not allow for paid parental leave. Our provisions in that regard run completely counter to the intent of the report he has just lauded. How can the Minister explain the Government, on the one hand, talking up work-life balance and trying to provide for quality of life while, on the other, legislation yet to be passed by the House provides nothing in that direction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputies will be aware, there have been considerable improvements in legislation in a number of areas in recent years. Deputy Ryan might say that the rate of progress has been much slower than he and others would like.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Nevertheless, the group undertook a very difficult job and is to be lauded for having formulated its report and recommendations. A vision was presented of a future workplace which is agile, customer-centred, knowledge intensive, responsive to employee needs, networked, highly productive, involved and participatory, continually learning and proactively diverse. It is the kind of workplace we all aspire to create. I am prepared to give the report every chance and to work closely with the social partners and others to deliver the quality of workplace envisaged.</P>

        <QRef>[12265/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I was disappointed to hear of the recent decision by the company in question to cease production at its Ennis-based manufacturing facility. The company employs 44 permanent and 87 temporary staff in its manufacturing operation and I understand the positions will be phased out over a 12 to 18 month period. The European sales and marketing team of 15 staff, which is also based in Ennis, is not affected by the decision. The job losses are the result of the company&rsquo;s decision to consolidate production at its facilities in the United States of America where it already has surplus capacity.</P>
        <P>This day last week, a meeting of the Industry Ennis group, which was formed in 2000, took place to discuss employment in Ennis. The group&rsquo;s primary function is to support and, where possible, augment the services of the development agencies which operate in the area, including IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the Clare County Enterprise Board. The outcome of the meeting was a decision by the group to develop a strategy to address employment in Ennis. The strategy will build on the group&rsquo;s work with State agencies to continue to promote Ennis through initiatives such as the Clare consul programme, which targets successful business people with Clare connections, and foreign direct investment itineraries.</P>
        <P>Industry Ennis has helped 20 companies to create 358 jobs, of which 280 are established, with the remainder to be filled in the coming months. The live register shows a decrease in Ennis of 130 people in the year-on-year position at March 2005. The reduction reflects the success to date of various initiatives for the area. Last year, Ennis benefited from investment decisions by Organic <Col N="1581"/>Lens, which decided to add to its existing operation, and Monster Cable, which announced a new project for the town. Organic Lens will implement a &euro;6.5 million programme of investment to develop its manufacturing operation which will create 100 jobs while Monster Cable will establish a shared-services centre which will create 50 jobs.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development has recently completed the construction of phase 1 of the information age park in Ennis, which is its fifth knowledge-network location in the mid-west. The park constitutes an overall investment of &euro;12.5 million in land, infrastructure and buildings and will provide 46,000 square feet of world-class incubation, expansion and own-door office accommodation in an urban park environment on the outskirts of the town. The investment marks the first phase of a significant development for Ennis and, as part of it, Shannon Development will relocate its regional office for Clare to the park. It is anticipated that over &euro;100 million will be invested in the park by the public and private sectors over the next 15 years.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the combined efforts of the development agencies together with the work of Industry Ennis will be sufficient to address the needs of the town. I look forward to examining the forthcoming strategy for the area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister provided statistics on overall employment, there have been over 570 job losses in Ennis in the past six years. As the Minister will know, Ennis is now the tenth largest town in Ireland with a population of 24,000, which will grow to 35,000 in 15 years. If people want to live there, they must want to work there also. While it is a fine town and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, will open next week the Organic Lens extension which will provide extra jobs, Ennis has not attracted the level of investment appropriate to a hub town. There are continuing job losses and seven companies have closed in the past six years. What will the Minister do about it? Did he come up with any plan during his recent visits to China and Australia?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has correctly identified that Ennis is a growth town, which it would not be if it were not a vibrant and attractive location.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is becoming a residential town.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It continues to grow as a genuine location for investment. Considerable restructuring is ongoing in the economy in the profiles of jobs and the sectors in which employment is growing and declining. The services sector is an obvious one in which there has been continued growth in employment. While there have been job losses in certain traditional areas, there have been job increases across the board in other sectors. Many additional jobs have been created which do not warrant a major announcement <Col N="1582"/>such as five in one business and ten in another. Jobs are also created through the more substantial projects announced, for example, by Monster Cable and Organic Lens.</P>
        <P>A town like Ennis cannot be considered in isolation. The live register shows a decrease which indicates that there is less unemployment in the town than there was this time last year. The town must be viewed in a regional context and in terms of the spatial plan through which IDA Ireland is marketing the region for investment and Ennis as a hub town, and will continue to do so. Through the work of Shannon Development, there will be a continuing focus on growing indigenous businesses in the Shannon area, including Ennis. When I was in China recently, I worked with Shannon Development, which organised a seminar to make a presentation to a number of interested parties of information on the company and the way in which it organises and supports indigenous enterprise in the mid-west.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister undertake in his Department an investment programme which specifically targets Ennis? It is his responsibility to promote enterprise, trade and employment. The manufacturing industry in the town continues to be eroded. While I acknowledge that the information age park which was opened last month is a fine facility, we need jobs for it which we are not getting. The Minister mentioned Industry Ennis, which is starved of the funding it needs to source and secure employment. While I acknowledge the establishment of Westpark Data Centre in Shannon for the database industry, which the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, launched last week, it will benefit the whole mid-west region, whereas I am calling for action on Ennis specifically. While there are many small to medium enterprises in Ennis, job losses occur among them also which we do not hear about. As the Minister has praised Ennis today, will he consider a specific investment programme for the town?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A considerable programme of investment in Ennis has been implemented across a range of Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Where are the jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Investment in fixed infrastructure leads ultimately to the attraction of jobs to an area and economic growth. The Deputy mentioned the information age park, which is a very significant investment for Ennis which, the Deputy will agree, will constitute a significant factor in the attraction of overseas and indigenous investment to the town. The Government&rsquo;s investment strategy includes the capital projects of various Departments on roads, schools and industrial parks. My Department works through development agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, county enterprise boards, of which Clare has a very fine one, and, in the mid-<Col N="1583"/>west, Shannon Development. They are the vehicles through which we endeavour to attract and facilitate investment in Ennis and similar locations.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s employment statistics are the best in Europe. Our unemployment rates are the lowest at 4%. There is an incompatibility between the statistical reality of employment and some of the commentary I hear from various locations across the country.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the litany of revelations of exploitation of migrant workers which have come to public attention in recent weeks, legislation will be brought forward to reform the work permits system in order that a work permit may be held by the employee rather than the employer.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12173/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Most of our labour force requirements can be met from within the European economic area, which comprises the 25 member states, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. A work permit is granted to an employer in respect of a specified employee and job vacancy where the employer can demonstrate that a vacancy cannot be filled from within the EEA. Apart from the renewal of existing permits, which constitute the bulk of applications, new permits are confined to highly skilled and highly paid positions. Current policy is informed by the imperative to address identified labour and skills needs in the economy. To best achieve these ends, work permits are applied and paid for by, and granted to, an employer, which ensures greater traceability, more effective enforcement of employees&rsquo; rights and enhanced administrative efficiency. Persons employed in Ireland under the work permit scheme in recent years have been readily facilitated in changing jobs. In such circumstances a new work permit is issued to the person&rsquo;s new employer. This allows an employee to move to a new employer where there are genuine reasons an employee wishes to leave his or her existing employment.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A new employment permits Bill, which is at the final stages of preparation, will include provision for additional protections for migrant workers. It is intended that employers will be prohibited from deducting from the remuneration of migrant workers any costs associated with their recruitment and the retention by employers of personal documents belonging to migrant workers. The issue of to whom the permit will be granted will be addressed in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the current system is designed to disempower migrant workers and facilitate their exploitation <Col N="1584"/>by employers or at least has that effect? Does the Minister also agree that a migrant worker, a person in a foreign land who probably has some language difficulties and whose ability to remain here is dependent on the employer who holds his or her work permit, is much more likely to tolerate exploitation or abuse than would an indigenous worker? Does the Minister accept that this is part of the problem and that resolving the issue of who holds the work permit is part of the solution? Does he further accept that if the employee were to hold the permit, it would reduce the almost total dependence on the employer in the first place? Recent revelations that have emerged about Gama Construction, Irish Ferries and a whole host of other employers demonstrate the level of difficulty that exists in this area, and how workers are being exploited.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is making reasonable points. The key issue in the legislation that is now pending is how we accommodate the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in terms of enhancing the empowerment of the employee in the relationship between employer and employee in the context of a work permit. Traceability is an important factor in terms of the protection of an employee. This is something we will probably discuss in the context of the Bill. If an employee holds the work permit, the element of traceability becomes more difficult and one may not become aware of a range of abuses that could be carried out in respect of certain employees.</P>
        <P>I accept the point that we must enhance and empower the employee to a much greater extent. We are examining the modality for doing that in the context of the application for work permits. In the proposed legislation it is my intention to give much greater freedom of mobility to employees to go to other employments and to make much greater statutory provision of information in terms of entitlements, salaries and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the reasons I have raised this issue on several occasions is to try to have it included in the provisions of the new Bill. Does the Minister accept that if it is not dealt with comprehensively within the Bill, the legislation will be considerably weakened? I look forward with interest to the publication of the Bill and wish it speedy progress. In light of the reticence on the inclusion of a measure to the effect that the employee would hold the work permit, has the Minister or the Department been lobbied by employers&rsquo; organisations to try to omit this from the Bill? In terms of the exploitation that exists in this area, we know of a Filipino woman who was employed by Irish Ferries for &euro;1 a day. Will such employers be prosecuted for transgressing on this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to the Deputy&rsquo;s input to the debate when the legislation comes before the House. I ask him to keep an open <Col N="1585"/>mind and take on board all the issues that will be raised. I want to achieve the right solution for employees. I have not been lobbied by any employer or employment body on this aspect of the Bill but submissions may have been received in the two years since the Bill was originally conceived.</P>

Where suitable workers were not available in Ireland or the wider European Economic Area, which consists of the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and for this purpose Switzerland, the shortage was catered for through the work permit system.</P>
        <P>In a gesture of solidarity with the ten new EU member states, the Government decided to allow free movement to nationals of these countries from the accession date on 1 May 2004. It was also decided that future economic migration from outside the European Economic Area would be confined to more highly skilled and highly paid personnel. In 2004, 34,000 work permits were issued, of which more than 10,000 related to new applications. In addition, in excess of 50,000 nationals of the ten new member states entered the State from May to December 2004.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the projections by the Central Statistics Office to which the Deputy refers. These projections are based on certain economic growth assumptions. Taking account of the projected future pattern of labour migration, including returning Irish emigrants, I am satisfied that Ireland&rsquo;s labour needs will be met in the years ahead. To this end the new employment permits Bill being finalised will contain provisions which will enable me to respond quickly and flexibly to skills shortages as they arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister address the question? He stated he is aware of the CSO report. The question I asked is if he accepts the projection that this economy will need 50,000 immigrants a year over the next 12 years if economic growth is to be maintained at a 3% to 5% range.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister also accept that there is a need for joined-up Government? His Department is often working at variance with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in these matters. For example, a case I am dealing with today indicates that people who have long-established roots in this country who apply for naturalisation must wait for two years or more for their case to be heard. Does the Minister accept that the changing face of employment and social structure in Ireland requires joined-up Government in a way that does not currently pertain? Will he as Minister ensure that there is a cross-departmental focus on this issue so that there is an orderly transition to a changing demographic and ethnic mix in Ireland and that the needs of the economy are met in a structured, rational and acceptable way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the CSO projections but all such projections come with the qualification that they are based on a range of assumptions. Given the assumptions made, especially those concerning economic growth and demographic factors, we are working on the basis that the figures given are those that will be required on an annual basis. The numbers that have entered the <Col N="1587"/>country from the new accession states is about 60,000. I will try to get hard data on that. The total up to the end of December 2004 was 50,000.</P>
        <P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point on joined-up Government. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and I have agreed a joint process whereby we will initially create a virtual one stop shop for people that will embrace the entire immigration service, visas, work permits and so on. We are now engaged in a joint programme to achieve that. My Department obviously has responsibility for economic migration policy and the new legislation on work permits will reflect that. I also retain authority over the issuing of work permits. Ultimately we want to reach a stage where people apply to the one office, in essence, and everything else will follow from that. Historically, both Departments will have come to this point from different perspectives. My Department is anxious to facilitate economic development and growth to ensure there are no labour shortages within the economy. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a whole range of other objectives and protections to consider in terms of the wider State that it must statutorily deal with. The bottom line is that we are very anxious and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has recently issued proposals as regards the one-stop-shop approach. He has also recently issued a thoughtful publication on immigration services and policy generally. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; is the answer to both questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply because it is important. Will he accept that there are basically three pillars to the issue? One is a rational policy of migration to meet the economic needs of the country and to allow people who want to increase their economic well-being to come here. The second is a rational policy to deal with asylum seekers, which is quite separate and often confused with the first pillar. The third is a rational and structured policy of integration to avoid strains and stresses on ethnic change in society. Will the Minister accept that this requires a joint effort from Government rather than it being the sole responsibility of an individual Minister? I deduce from his original answer that this type of thinking is now under way in his Department and within Government. When will the joined-up process manifest in structures that meet the needs of a changing Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has already commenced. On the Deputy&rsquo;s first two points about the economic migration policy and asylum seeking, rational policies are in place as regards both of them. A sophisticated skilled forecasting mechanism has been in place since 1998. It is the future skills needs group established jointly by the T&aacute;naiste and myself. If we have learned anything from that, it is the necessity for flexibility and adaptability in terms of projecting what will happen in <Col N="1588"/>global economic trends and the different sectors requiring skills at various times. In terms of asylum seeking, Deputy McDowell has a clear framework in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The current policy is a problem for a quarter of our businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the Government&rsquo;s position and perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had significant successes on both fronts. In terms of the integration issue, I accept this has to be a cross-Government approach. Again, there is evidence that employers in various sectors and under the aegis of different Departments have engaged in much proactive activity on the issue of integration, multicultural diversity etc., to try to provide a range of supports for people who come from other countries. We can do more and I have had preliminary discussions with the unions on how we may facilitate in particular the absorption and integration of workers from other EU countries, and indeed from outside the EU, who may have significant language difficulties, for example. By virtue of having significant language difficulties, they have problems in accessing information, which can be to their benefit, in terms of protecting their rights and so forth. I am broadly supportive of the points the Deputy has made. I would argue that we have rational policies in place in respect of the key issue of economic migration and asylum seeking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that in the interests of joined-up thinking, it would be good to know not just the numbers of migrant workers coming in but also to have some indication where they are working? The national spatial strategy is now being treated more or less as a joke by reasonable commentators. From what the Minister says, we are possibly looking at 60,000 to 100,000. If a significant percentage of this number is working in the Dublin area, for example, this has massive implications for infrastructural investment and national planning. Does he or his Department have any information about where those workers are employed? It would also be useful to know what they work at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Because we took away the work permit requirement for citizens of the European Union and particularly those from the new accession states, there is not a ready-made database with information on the people coming in. It means one has to go through CSO statistics or locally based assessments of what is happening in terms of where people are living and so on. The Deputy is correct. The economic growth rates we are likely to experience to the end of the decade mean growth in the economy of around 5.5% on average as well as growth in the labour force. The CSO is saying that the labour force will continue <Col N="1589"/>to grow from 1.9 million, for example, at 2004 levels, to about 2.4 million in 2016. That is a very significant increase, which basically impacts on infrastructure, housing, utilities and a range of issues, including education, health etc.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the introduction of flexible working hours is a matter for negotiation between employees, or a trade union acting on their behalf, and employers. I have no plans to introduce flexible working hours on a statutory basis for all employees. Current legislation provides for statutory entitlement to maternity leave, adoptive leave, carers&rsquo; leave and parental leave. Further legislation is currently being progressed in the Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to enhance certain provisions of existing legislation as regards parental and adoptive leave. It is intended that these amendments to parental and adoptive leave legislation will be finalised by summer 2005.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s response to this question makes an utter mockery of his reply to my priority question earlier. This is so if we are to take a leading role, as described in the work place strategy paper already referred to, in providing the flexible working environment that will aid competitiveness and help keep people in the economy who otherwise might leave. Is the Minister of State aware that there is an increasing incidence of people with young children, for example, who are exiting the workplace because they face the impossible choice between very expensive child care and the lack of flexible working conditions? It is very difficult for them to get back in. Will he agree that the provision of flexible working conditions in that regard would allow a much better quality of life to be provided for people rearing children and also keep them at work or allow them greater access to return? How can he say, on the one hand, that we are moving in this direction in terms of work-life balance, and then say he will not provide for guaranteed flexible working arrangements, contrary to what is best practice in many other European countries? It makes a mockery of all the Minister of State&rsquo;s good intentions and earlier assurances. He is ruling out the first major plank in such a strategy. It was very interesting to hear the direct evidence from child care providers and officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform at this morning&rsquo;s hearing of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. The evidence clearly was that the demand is for flexible child care arrangements because people want the <Col N="1590"/>mix of flexible working associated with this. They cannot manage with what the PDs and Fianna F&aacute;il are forcing them to do, either to get back into the workplace full-time or exit totally. What is the Minister of State doing, by saying he will not allow that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the great advantages of the current system is that the voluntary approach has been very successful. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, considerable numbers of workers are employed part-time, and very successfully. If at this stage we were to introduce a statutory right for all workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking what Government policy is as regards allowing spouses into this country. If tens of thousands of work permits are being issued on average, the current ballpark figure is between 40,000 and 50,000 annually. The <Col N="1591"/>number of work permits issued, more than 1,000 according to the Minister, is a tiny fraction of that figure. What is the Government&rsquo;s policy? What criteria is used to allow spouses to come to Ireland? Is it the case that where spouses are allowed to enter the State, they too are given work permits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste, when Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, introduced an initiative in February 2004 to facilitate easier access to the labour market by spouses of certain skilled non-EEA nationals working in the State. Concerns had been raised about Ireland&rsquo;s continued capacity to attract high-skilled personnel, particularly in cases where spouses did not have an automatic right to work in the State. I recall when holding the health portfolio, this problem was most evident in the health services for the approximately 4,500 high-skilled nurses from outside the European Economic Area. They indicated their willingness to stay in the health sector depended on their spouses being allowed to join them and permitted to work. The arrangements made were confined to spouses working in the State on working visas or work authorisations, to spouses of certain intra-company transferees and spouses of certain academics and researchers. Medical professionals on work permits were dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>Most spouses travelling to Ireland, arrive on a spouse&rsquo;s visa which does not allow them to work in the State. However, when they find a job they can obtain a work permit. The new rules are aimed at giving greater ease of access to employment for those spouses for the estimated 10,000 skilled non-EEA nationals working in the labour market. By 15 April 2005, up to 1,041 work permit applications were received in respect of the spouses of non-EEA nationals. Of those, 1,019 were granted. It is a fairly high response rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to elucidate what exactly is the Government&rsquo;s policy. It seems to be a very limited area, where the spouses of workers who are attracted to this economy and given work permits and are allowed to join them and work in this economy. I have dealt with several cases of where family members of doctors from abroad had difficulties in getting visitors&rsquo; visas to enter the State. It links into the family friendly workplace issue. Will the Minister consider extending the supports for families to include the families of workers attracted to and required for our economy so that we do not have forced separation? Will the Minister agree that 1,000 work permits, against the backdrop of the number of migrant workers entering the State, is a tiny proportion? It will have the effect of making this economy unattractive for skilled workers when a more progressive policy is available in other developed European and north American countries.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has not been reviewed since its introduction. The legislation allows us to either give a statutory underpinning to the scheme or review the policy. As these were areas of acute staff shortages in the economy, the Government changed the arrangements for those workers. Economic migration policy is adaptable and flexible to the given needs of a given time. It is not asylum policy that creates an open door, merging the asylum issue with economic migration. These are issues that need to be addressed collectively.</P>

	<P>A point was raised earlier that if so many workers are coming in, what will be the impact on education and health services and other structures? There needs to be limits, balances and some degree of caution in thinking this through to five year&rsquo;s time.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister engage with the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on this issue? He has made valid points that have not been debated properly with cross-party consensus. I am specifically referring to individuals whose spouses are in Ireland and who have skills that could add to the economy but are debarred from it. They feel excluded although they are resident in Ireland. Will a case-by-case based facility be put in place for those affected spouses to have their cases heard?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>These numbers are modest. Will the Minister accept that if a much-needed worker is granted a permit, it is then reasonable that he or she should not be separated from his or her partner? In most Irish families, both parents work to maintain the household. These permit workers are no different. Is it not fair that they should be offered the opportunity for their spouses to work?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many skilled workers see it as a phase where they come to Ireland to earn higher wages and remunerate their families at home to increase their living standards. This is an understandable desire, as the Irish did it for many generations. There must be some balance in how we address this issue. Ireland has been more generous than most by having an open policy to inward worker migration. This was evidenced in our response in advance of the ten accession states joining the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 239 together.</P>
        <P>Each year the National Competitiveness Council undertakes a comprehensive analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness performance and publishes its results in its annual competitiveness report. The council benchmarks Ireland&rsquo;s performance relative to competitor countries, including Euro-zone countries. Based on this analysis <Col N="1594"/>the council also publishes its competitiveness challenge report, which offers a list of policy recommendations aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position. These recommendations, presented to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, make a significant contribution to policy development in all areas affecting competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The most recent reports by the National Competitiveness Council were published in October 2004. Both reports found the economic environment for 2004 encouraging. The economy experienced significant improvements in the growth of GNP, employment and a reduction in the unemployment rate. According to ESRI&rsquo;s spring 2005 quarterly economic commentary, the economy will continue its robust performance with rates of 5.7% in real GDP and 5.0% for real GNP forecast for 2005, followed by rates of 5.5% and 5.8%, respectively, in 2006. Following an exceptional strong employment growth of 3% last year labour market conditions are expected to remain strong in both 2005 and 2006. It is forecast that the unemployment rate will stabilise to average 4.3% in both 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>However, the council&rsquo;s analysis discovered several constraints and threats to future competitiveness. Chief among these was the increasing cost base relative to our trading partners. The 2004 competitiveness challenge report stated there is a need to make wage setting, governmental spending and taxation more responsive to changing competitiveness developments. We must address our increasing cost base to protect our competitiveness. This continues to be a high priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken several steps to address the issue of prices and costs in Ireland. In budget 2005, by not increasing indirect taxes, the Government demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that the progress made on reducing consumer price inflation last year continues this year. The most recent consumer price index figures from the CSO show that inflation fell to 2.1% in March. That was the fourth consecutive month that Ireland&rsquo;s rate of inflation decreased.</P>
        <P>If we wish to improve our competitiveness, Ireland cannot afford to have sheltered sectors of the economy immune from competition. The key to reducing prices and maintaining them at optimal levels in the long term is to ensure that vibrant competition is present in all sectors of the Irish economy. That is why the Government has strengthened the powers and resources of the Competition Authority, which is charged with combating anti-competitive practice in the economy.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The NCC also found that there remains an inconsistency between our image as a high technology economy and our underlying knowledge base. The Government recognises that the research agenda is one of the most important <Col N="1595"/>elements in terms of our drive to increase both competitiveness and quality employment now and in the future. A group involving representatives from industry, venture capitalists, the universities and institutes of technology, Departments and agencies has developed Ireland&rsquo;s research and development action plan under the aegis of my Department. The plan was published in August 2004. It sets a target of spend on research and development of 2.5% of GNP by 2010 and makes a range of high level recommendations in pursuit of this. These recommendations are ambitious but represent the type of actions Ireland needs to take if it is to continue to be competitive in a fast changing globalised economy.</P>
        <P>The NCC also made a number of other recommendations in the areas of entrepreneurship, enterprise development, innovation and creativity. These and other recommendations are being considered by an interdepartmental group of senior officials, which is chaired by my Department. The interdepartmental group is currently preparing a report on the NCC&rsquo;s recommendations, which will be submitted to Government before the summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should breathe a collective sigh of relief that the Government did not increase indirect taxes in the last budget, given that it has imposed 27 stealth taxes since the last general election. We should be pleased. Will the Minister accept that important recommendations have been highlighted to him and to the Department of the Taoiseach over a long period of time but no action has been taken on them? This is particularly true with regard to the regulatory burden faced by businesses.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister intend to make changes to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act, which was enacted some time ago, particularly with regard to the compliance statement? Does the Minister accept that the regulatory burden imposes considerable additional costs on businesses and consumers? The Taoiseach&rsquo;s publication, Better Regulation, highlighted this in January 2004 but, regrettably, no action was taken. Will the Minister make an attempt to implement the recommendations in that document? It recommended that any legislation introduced which affected business or consumers should be necessary, sustainable, accountable and transparent, without imposing an additional cost burden on business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Bill mentioned by the Deputy, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, commented in the Seanad last week that certain aspects of the legislation would be reviewed and that the CLRG group would examine it. The Minister of State and I have heard a range of submissions and presentations from interested parties in various sec<Col N="1596"/>tors who have concerns about over-regulation and some elements of the Act being too exacting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

	<P>Read my speech.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>We listened to those views and have responded to them. However, the experience of many major companies that locate in Ireland &mdash; I have met many of them through IDA Ireland &mdash; is that Ireland is probably the best place to locate and do business in Europe. The structures of governance in Ireland are more responsive and agile in meeting the needs of enterprise and in removing barriers or obstacles that could inhibit the growth or establishment of a business.</P>
        <P>With regard to the competitiveness report, an early decision taken by the Government was on the planning guidelines. It is interesting that on the one hand the Government is attacked for not responding to recommendations from bodies such as the competitiveness council but when it does respond, it is immediately attacked on all sides.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked about the recommendations of the NCC.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but the parliamentary question is about the competitiveness council&rsquo;s report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask about any report, I asked for the Minister&rsquo;s view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the major vehicle for dealing with the competitiveness issue. We get an independent body, the competitiveness council, to assess the competitive challenges and to make recommendations to Government. When that happens, however, the Government is damned regardless of whether it implements the recommendations.</P>
        <P>Research and development is a key competitiveness issue. We have invested significantly in this over recent years and we have work on hand to increase both the level and quality of investment in future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion of the cost of waste management and disposal and the contribution it makes to additional costs for business and consumers?

	<P>The catch up phase of the past seven or eight years has, by definition, resulted in far greater costs for local authorities in providing, for example, better landfills than were provided in the 1970s and 1980s. We did not deal well with waste over many decades. The availability of resources was a key issue. There was also a lack of knowledge and so forth.</P>

	<P>The lack of competitiveness mentioned by my colleague, in addition to the failure of a product to evolve, has had a devastating effect on Wicklow in the past couple of weeks. The Minister says we are in top place in Europe but that is little consolation when jobs can be moved to other countries. A total of 140 jobs at AO Smith Corporation in Bray were lost last <Col N="1598"/>week while 94 jobs will be lost at Veha in Wicklow town at the end of the month. Will the Minister use his Department&rsquo;s agencies to involve the workers concerned in a reskilling or retraining programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great sympathy for the workers concerned. In such circumstances we ask the State agencies to get involved quickly. F&Aacute;S offers services such as alternative job opportunities and training programmes which workers can undertake to enhance their skills and secure alternative employment. Enterprise Ireland works in an area which has suffered job losses through adding jobs in indigenous enterprises or through creating new indigenous start-up enterprises with the help of the county enterprise board. IDA Ireland seeks to attract investment into the region.</P>
        <P>One must consider this in the context of the region. If one looks at single towns in isolation, one will encounter similar stories. However, there have been substantial increases in investment and jobs in Wicklow and south Dublin in recent years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 87% of our energy needs are met by importing fossil fuels. Since the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s report was published last October there has been another spike in oil prices. The price is $55 per barrel today. Does the Minister agree that this is a major threat to our competitiveness? We are uniquely exposed. What analysis has the Minister carried out in that regard and what remedial action can the Department take to tackle what I believe will be the biggest crisis for our economy and society in the next ten years?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My reach does not extend that far. I accept the strategic points raised by the Deputy. We can support alternative energy sources by the provision of investment across Departments. Other Departments have greater responsibility on this issue.</P>
        <P>I am interested in supporting research into energy conservation and the development of products and services, in the workplace and elsewhere, that would reduce dependency on fossil fuels. I do not have a great depth of knowledge about Japan but it appears to be forging ahead in terms of technology and is investing in products and services that focus on energy conservation and reducing its dependency on certain types of energy. That should happen here.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Following my recent announcement on 12 April, there are now 31 labour inspector posts. Immediate steps have been taken to source the new inspectors initially from within the existing staff complement of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Accordingly, I expect early appointments. There are currently 17.5 labour inspectors, whole-time equivalents, in the inspectorate. One inspector is currently on long-term sick leave and one job-sharing inspector is on extended unpaid leave. A further two inspectors are currently engaged in assisting the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>A number of other officials, at team leader and management grades within the employment rights compliance section, are considered inspectors and perform such duties as required. The inspectors are supported by six administrative staff and the inspectorate makes up but one part of the employment rights compliance section. The other parts consist of the employment rights information unit and the employment rights prosecution and enforcement section. There are approximately 600 cases currently under investigation by the labour inspectorate. The cases relate to various alleged breaches of employment rights legislation, including payment of wages, holiday pay and overtime.</P>
        <P>Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>Much of this information was covered in earlier questions. When was this lack of resources in the labour inspectorate brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention? Did it require the controversy surrounding Gama Construction to bring this matter to his attention and the flurry of activity which led to his announcement on April 12?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue was raised at the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress and I was not a Minister of State at that stage. At the first meeting I had with SIPTU, that was one of the issues raised. We have been seeking resources to announce the additional inspector since then. The announcement on 12 April addresses the immediate concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was brought to the attention of the Department 18 months ago that there was a major deficiency in the number of inspectors. There was clearly a number of complaints to the <Col N="1600"/>Department about these matters. Why is it that resources can be plucked out of the air when a controversy arises in this House? Following the revelations by Deputy Joe Higgins, 11 additional inspectors were approved at the drop of a hat. It must have been a low priority in the Department in 2004 when the Minister could not deliver a speedy implementation of these essential labour inspectors. A great number of inspectors have now been appointed in one fell swoop. There must have been a large deficiency in the Department, as well as many complaints, which led him to do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be careful, or she might hit back. Mr. Kelly is doing his job over there now and he is very effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was raised by the unions in the mid-term review. A recommendation was made at that stage. Ultimately, the recommended number of inspectors was 21. Clearly, the unions were extremely dissatisfied with that outcome. However, since Deputy Martin and I were appointed to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, this matter has been raised frequently with us. It is fair to say that the appointments represent a substantial increase in a very short timescale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a degree of brass neck in the response by the Minister of State. Parliamentary questions have been tabled on this issue for years. This issue was raised by myself, among others, in the debate on the health and safety legislation. The response he and his predecessor presented was that there was adequate inspection and no need for further inspectors. It is only the crisis of recent times that has changed the Minister&rsquo;s view. He can now find the resources, without it being signalled in the Estimates that were published, for a substantial increase from 17.5 inspectors, not the 21 we were led to believe, to 28 or more. When did it really dawn on the Minister that this substantial requirement was needed? When will these inspectors be put in place? When they are put in place, will that be adequate to police a workforce of 2 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in the business of adjudicating on the strength of brass neck on this issue. A number of people have raised this need for an increase in the number of inspectors, Deputy Howlin among them. This issue was raised long before I was in the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The response was that they were not needed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I would not have been answering parliamentary questions at that stage. In October or November 2004, I felt that additional inspectors were required. I discussed the matter with the Minister, Deputy Martin, who <Col N="1601"/>was of the same view. The necessary financial provision was not there for them. In view of those circumstances, the additional appointments represented a very quick response.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the adjournment of this debate, I welcomed this Bill and complimented the garda&iacute;. I spoke about the success of setting up the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the successful policing operations the body has carried out. I now wish to mention some the difficulties the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na experiences. There is often a lack of direction and management in how the garda&iacute; operate and how they acquire access to resources. In Mullingar, the Garda was short a number of squad cars and some garda&iacute; had to use their own cars to do their jobs. This is a ridiculous way to do business.</P><Col N="1602"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?><P>In the last few days, a garda in the community, who has teenage children himself, raised a query with me to which he is unable to get a response. We are now approaching the period where debs balls are taking place around the country. Schoolchildren attend these events and they are generally very successful. With the introduction of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, children under 18 are no longer allowed to be on a licensed premises after 9 p.m. What is the status of debs balls that take place in licensed premises? The people attending these events can often be as young as 15 and only a small proportion of them are over 18. Yet in most cases, the bars are open. How stands the legality of this issue? It is imperative that the Minister clarifies the issue so well-meaning garda&iacute;, who want what is best for our communities, do not get caught off-side when intervening.</P>
      <P>Members will recall that deportation orders were applied to mainly Nigerian citizens in this country, many of whom had lived here for quite some time. There were two ladies in my constituency who lived in Athlone. They were deported even though their children had been in school in Athlone for quite some time. They had integrated into the community and there was a great deal of local support for them to remain there. I emphasise that this does not concern the activities of the local Garda force, but rather the garda&iacute; from the national immigration bureau who swept into Athlone to do their job. I wish to quote from a letter from Mr. Noel Casey, the deputy principal of Our Lady&rsquo;s Bower secondary school in Athlone. I know Mr. Casey who is an extremely dedicated teacher and does his job in an exemplary fashion. His letter outlines the events that occurred recently in that girls&rsquo; school. It states:</P>
      <P LI="1">At approximately 4 p.m. I was supervising evening study in the central area [of the school]. I saw a lady stride purposefully into the school followed by a uniformed female Garda who had a very distressed Ms Odunsi [she was the lady who was to be deported], Ayo&rsquo;s mother, by the arm [this was not a grip of support but of restraint, the Garda never let go of Ms Odunsi&rsquo;s arm while they were in the school. I knew who these people were so I left the study area to talk to them. They had turned into the school office and as I entered the area I heard the plain clothes officer loudly look for Ayo [who was one of the students]. I informed this lady that I had sent Ayo home at 3.30 p.m. This lady then motioned me to one side and asked me where Ayo was, I told her again that I had sent Ayo home. The officer seemed to become angry with this response and she demanded an explanation. I informed her that school ends at 3.30 p.m. and that I had no direction from anybody to do anything different. The officer again demanded information on Ayo&rsquo;s whereabouts so I called to Mariann Oviawe [another Nigerian] who was standing <Col N="1603"/>nearby to give whatever information she had regarding Ayo. Mariann simply stated that Ayo had gone home. The officer aggressively demanded Mariann&rsquo;s name and seemed to imply some sort of threat against her if she did not give any more information. Mariann insisted that as far as she knew Ayo had gone home. She did not know where Ayo was. The officer then turned on her heel and stormed out of the school. The uniformed Garda took Ayo&rsquo;s mother out to their car.</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0"> In her time at the school the plain clothes officer failed to show any ID, she never identified herself, she never stated her business. She did behave in an aggressive and threatening manner. Ms Odunsi attempted to talk to me and this officer aggressively told her to be quiet and not to be foolish. </P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">This entire incident was witnessed by approximately 100 students who were in the study and the students who were waiting for lifts and buses by the school door. A number of staff members were also present.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That incident happened in a secondary school in County Westmeath. The Garda in question did not identify herself, although I presume she was a Garda, but would only say that she was going about her duty, which was perhaps a difficult one. Surely, however, there are better ways and means of doing one&rsquo;s work. Over the years the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has built up a rapport with the public whose trust and friendship they have earned. Such activities as outlined the letter are not the way to assure local people that everybody will be treated humanely. It is outrageous that this activity took place. The school in question has a particularly good relationship with local garda&iacute; but the garda&iacute; involved in this case had come from out of town.</P>
      <P>Turning to other provisions of the Bill, I welcome the facility to establish local policing committees in consultation and association with local authorities. Like many other Members of the House, I welcome the establishment of such bodies. Public representatives and others have a big role to play in such committees because major difficulties are emerging on housing estates. Even in my own town of Mullingar, garda&iacute; are reluctant to enter some estates at night-time due to difficulties they may encounter there. Late at night, the clientele of various nightclubs spill out on to the streets at the same time. Thousands of young people may congregate on the streets, which makes for difficult policing. Community endeavour is required to seek solutions to ease the situation and make life safer not just for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but for the local communities. Establishment of local policing bodies will help to achieve that.</P>
      <P>I agree with other speakers who have said membership of such bodies should not be confined to public representatives. For example, resi<Col N="1604"/>dents&rsquo; associations comprising fair-minded people with inside knowledge, could have a good input into such committees. They should form part of the selection process for local policing committees. We should not confine the membership entirely to local elected representatives, but should try to make the composition of the committees as broadly based as possible.</P>
      <P>We should also carefully examine the way in which such committees will carry out their work. I have an open mind as to whether this work should be done in public or private. If it takes place in public session there will not be the kind of exchange of ideas, including frank discussions, that might be necessary to make such bodies work well. Perhaps there is a case to be made for such bodies to meet in private but issue an agreed concluding statement.</P>
      <P>I wanted to refer to other items but unfortunately time has caught up with me. I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for having allowed me to contribute to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this important, albeit long awaited and delayed, Bill. A prominent member of the SDLP described the Good Friday Agreement as &ldquo;Sunningdale for slow learners&rdquo;. Slowly, the Government has accepted the requirement for reforms mirrored in this legislation. The issue of policing is an extremely important one for any civilised society. The police force is the bulwark for any community in order to maintain an ordered society governed by the rule of law. We seek such a society where citizens can avail of rights while exercising their duties and responsibilities, where disputes are arbitrated upon by the courts, and where legislation is enforced by a focused police force acting within the law.</P>
      <P>Our history is a good one in terms of policing and we are fortunate to have a force such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Its members have steadfastly defended the State against a variety of threats, including protracted armed criminal subversion. In all too many cases, including one of which I am aware in my home town of Wexford, the ultimate sacrifice was required. Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have literally laid down their lives to protect this State, our Constitution and our laws. Therefore, in conducting a debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it is incumbent upon us &mdash; and I want to be open and honest in my analysis, in a warts-and-all manner &mdash; to place on the record of the House a clear acknowledgment of the debt that both the State and its people have to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. No less than any other institution of the State, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been evolving and developing just as the State has been doing. During Question Time we discussed many of the pressure points of changes in ethnicity, population base and structure and disposition of population. All these matters impinge on the nature of policing, the training for it and the quality of the <Col N="1605"/>individuals we call to police us. They are important, and the structures put in place in the mid-1920s if unmodified, cannot be expected to be appropriate for today.</P>

      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be reviewed in terms of its changing role, structure and an increasing demand across all sectors of public administration and public life for transparency and accountability. There are Members of this House for whom the mention of transparency and accountability makes their hair stand on end because they are over-used and hackneyed words. However, all other elements of public administration, including politicians such as ourselves in this House, have had to face the need for reform. We have done so in a variety of legislative measures we put in place to impact on our conduct, such as the electoral Acts, beginning with the Electoral Act 1997, which I had the privilege of introducing in this House. For the first time, this brought transparency in donation statements, requirements for declarations of Members of the House and it capped election expenditure so there would at least be a transparent mechanism for the conduct of political business. That was mirrored by the Ethics in Public Offices Act and the Freedom of Information Act, both additional groundbreaking enactments which introduced changes for political activity.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>We have seen other legislation impacting on the business community as business scandals showed the need for change in banking. God knows there have been enough banking scandals to show that we needed to tighten our company law and strengthen the entitlements of individuals who do business with banks. That has been achieved through the appointment of IFSRA and other regulatory authorities. The public service too has been transformed through the strategic management initiative and others enactments such as the Ethics in Public Offices Act which impacted on senior public servants as well as on politicians. All of this characterised a wind of change blowing through public administration, and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is not immune from the necessity of addressing that climate of change.</P>
      <P>It was in that context that as justice spokesman several years ago I produced proposals for reforming legislation. I promulgated two separate pieces of legislation at the time &mdash; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Authority Bill, which would have established an independent, transparent and publicly accountable authority to run and set the operation parameters for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Garda Ombudsman Bill, which would have established an independent monitoring system to process complaints about Garda activities. I said at the time that I did not pluck the details of those pieces of legislation from the sky. I relied heavily on the root and branch work done by the Patten commission in Northern Ireland, one of the most exhaustive analyses of what would constitute effective policing in a not entirely dissimilar juris<Col N="1606"/>diction. It contained very good models, ideas and proposals which could be replicated in this jurisdiction. It is interesting that the response of the then Minister for Justice, the current Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, was one of scorn and dismissal. That was the original reaction I got to the proposals I outlined. According to the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, there was no need for any structural reform.</P>
      <P>I welcome this slow evolution, away from downright opposition to the acknowledgment for the need for reform and the inclusion in the legislation of many of the provisions I set out a few years ago. It is a pity is has taken so long because the country and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have been better served had the legislation been enacted when I proposed it. Once this Bill is enacted, what will go on the Statute Book will not be very dissimilar to the proposals I put forward.</P>
      <P>I have noted the general importance of policing and the debt of gratitude we have as a State to the competence, professionalism and skill of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the decades in the face of a genuine threat to the survival of our constitutional democracy. I need to mention the downside because the context of all the proposals I put forward was the backdrop of the information I received regarding the activities of certain garda&iacute; in Donegal. At the time, there was a blanket refusal by the then Minister to have an inquiry into those matters. Unfortunately, that refusal lasted too long and it was quite some time before it was proven beyond doubt that an investigation was required, and the Morris tribunal was established.</P>
      <P>I do not want to digress from the contents of the Bill, but the Morris tribunal reveals an extraordinary set of circumstances whereby the principals at the heart of the investigation being carried out by Mr. Justice Morris, the extended McBrearty family and associates, have not had their legal fees guaranteed in advance, so that they are precluded from feeling that they can participate fully in the inquiry. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will address this extraordinary and unjust set of circumstances and I understand he will meet the McBrearty family this week.</P>
      <P>We will have further debate on that matter in due course and I will not dwell on it today. There are other matters, such as the Abbeylara incident, which this House originally sought to investigate. Unfortunately, because of legal decisions, that matter is the subject of a further tribunal. Other disturbing cases include the investigation into the tragic Grangegorman murders in which two women were stabbed to death in March 1997. A suspect, Dean Lyons, was first questioned in July 1997, in a session which was electronically recorded. The recording indicates a person who was incoherent and lacked the ability to express himself properly. The man was clearly a heroin addict. Subsequently, however, he made a written <Col N="1607"/>statement to garda&iacute; in the Bridewell that was lucid and clear and which contained key information relating to the murders which could have been known only to the investigating garda&iacute; and the murderer. Clearly, Dean Lyons could not have committed the murders. That has now been acknowledged and an apology has issued, many years after the event. I raised the issue at the time.</P>
      <P>Other cases include that taken against Colm Murphy with regard to the Omagh bombing of 1998. In that case, the court criticised two Garda witnesses. The judge said the two named garda&iacute; had been involved in persistently lying under oath. The Paul Ward case is another, and there are more cases I will not list, but I note all these as a backdrop for the requirement for reform.</P>
      <P>I said that I used as my template the Patten proposals because they merited being taken seriously and were a good template to replicate in this jurisdiction. The methodology used by Patten was outlined by my colleague Deputy Costello in some detail. It was an exhaustive, consultative process that looked at effective policing in a jurisdiction not 1,000 miles removed from ours and which clearly had lessons to teach us. The principle enunciated in the Patten Commission report was simple, but important: &ldquo;Every member of the force must remember that his duty is to protect and help members of the public, no less than to apprehend guilty persons.&rdquo; It is important that the duty is to protect and help the public and not simply, although an important part of the job, to apprehend the guilty.</P>
      <P>I will mention some details of the Labour Party proposals I had the privilege to produce some years ago. One proposal was the establishment of a Garda authority. This remains a good proposal because it gives a democratic, overarching ownership of policing, which is important in a democracy. It makes policing part of and accountable to the community, not an extraneous force or part of some authoritarian regime separate from the community. A Garda authority is an extremely good mechanism to give that clear manifestation.</P>
      <P>A second proposal was the establishment, on the Northern Ireland model, of a Garda ombudsman. During my discussions I met the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, and she came to Dublin and met other Members on the matter of fleshing out our proposals. She has been a remarkable champion of justice and vindicator of good policing and has proven the robustness of the Northern Ireland model. It surprises me that after such a clear manifestation that it is the right model, we did not replicate it. The Minister has determined otherwise and I will deal with his proposals shortly. I also met the chairperson and the deputy chairperson of the Northern Ireland policing board to get the flavour of how they saw policing evolving.</P><Col N="1608"/>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal with regard to an ombudsman proposes to establish an ombudsman commission rather than an individual ombudsman. I will not quibble with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal, but it is surprising that a manifestly effective proposal in place in Northern Ireland was not replicated. I hope the Minister&rsquo;s proposal for a commission is not different for the sake of being different or not accepting a proposal put forward by the Labour Party some years ago. The yardstick and test of it will be whether it is an effective investigative mechanism that will allow thorough and fair investigation and have separate preservation and control of evidence and freedom of action. The proof of that will be apparent as the proposals come into effect.</P>
      <P>Another proposal in the Labour Party document of the time was a proposal for a police liaison committee modelled on the strategic policy committees &mdash; I had just left the then Department of the Environment &mdash; to involve elements of the community in discussing policing. Everybody knows that policing is a community issue. I thought then and still believe the SPC model would be a good one. That proposal has evolved in the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for joint policing committees. They are welcome and I hope they will be equally effective.</P>
      <P>The challenges facing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na occur at two levels. There is a national challenge of criminal gangs which were effectively dealt with after a period with the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. Some of the gangs operating were crushed, jailed or fled the jurisdiction. Unfortunately, they have been replaced by even more vicious thugs who, as we have seen in recent times, clearly have no regard for life and readily engage in violent murder. At local level, as the leader of the Labour Party has said repeatedly, the issue of anti-social behaviour is blighting neighbourhoods throughout the country. While mainly in the larger urban centres, anti-social behaviour occurs in every community.</P>
      <P>We have some legislation to deal with anti-social behaviour. In our time in Government we brought in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to deal with anti-social behaviour in local authority housing. However, we need to go further as the real issue is not legislation. We have the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act which have a number of provisions yet to be introduced. It is the effective use of those powers by people who are plugged into their communities that is at the core of effective community policing. If that does not happen, if there are no garda&iacute; who know the people and families in a neighbourhood and who can listen, hear, act and be there, and unless we reconnect with communities, policing will not be as effective as it could be. This is key for the new regimes. Will they reconnect with communities? Will we have designated garda&iacute; to link with and stay in communities in the long term and physi<Col N="1609"/>cally to control the communities and be community garda&iacute; who are friends of their communities, know them and act accordingly?</P>
      <P>The issue of the Judiciary is important if we are to have effective policing. We need to revisit the issue of judicial conduct and training etc. This was dealt with by the previous Minister but he abandoned his proposal. We need to come back to it so that we can have judges who know the needs of communities and who will act appropriately and consistently.</P>
      <P>We need proper recruitment to the Garda. I know an Irishman who was a commander in a police force elsewhere. He could not come back to Ireland unless he went to Templemore and started again. We need cross-fertilisation with good police from abroad who want to come and work in Ireland. The Minister should be open to that. We have a world class facility in Templemore, but not everybody needs to start at garda level. We must be open to some cross-fertilisation from good effective forces elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Section 14 proposes volunteer garda&iacute;. I would like to see this proposal fleshed out. I have no intrinsic opposition to it, but we need to see the detail to know if it is a proposition that will assist effective policing and the Garda rather than be a burden. I support the thrust of the measures in the Bill and wish it had come before the House some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the main provisions of this Bill, namely, the reform of the law relating to the administration and management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, most importantly, the establishment of an independent Garda ombudsman commission. The setting up of this commission is welcome because there was a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the Garda complaints board. That was no wonder because garda&iacute; were investigating garda&iacute;. Even if everything was fine and above board, the idea of garda&iacute; investigating complaints against their colleagues was unsatisfactory. Not alone should justice be done, it should be seen to be done. The composition of the Garda complaints board, therefore, could not instil confidence in an increasingly suspicious public. These suspicions were fuelled by the revelations that emerged as a matter of course from the various tribunals. This section is welcome and the appointment of the personnel who will comprise the new commission is awaited.</P>
      <P>Section 86, which provides for the referral of a complaint by the commission to the Garda Commissioner for investigation, is totally unacceptable because it completely undermines the establishment and independence of the proposed Garda commission. The Minister is reverting to that which he purports to change. The Garda is again being asked to investigate its own members. The Minister likes to give the impression a new independent investigation pro<Col N="1610"/>cedure is being introduced but unless the section is deleted, there will be no change.</P>
      <P>The legislation also addresses the administration and management of the Garda, which is welcome, because many issues need to be dealt with such as the notion of returning to the old method of community policing. A number of intellectuals who know everything about everything and who have the remedies for all our ills may smirk at this notion but they do not know what they are talking about. The solution to problems such as anti-social behaviour, petty crime and intimidation of old and young citizens is to ensure more garda&iacute; reside and are on the beat in local communities. They will have a relationship with locals to whom they can speak to obtain valuable information which can be acted on, resulting in much of the intimidation, petty crime and anti-social behaviour being stamped out and leading to a semblance of normality being returned to citizens who live in fear of young thugs. Community policing based on the old methods of policing is the solution.</P>
      <P>A Garda Commissioner, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or Government who ignores the benefits of community policing does a disservice to the State. The Government made a commitment to recruit 2,000 additional garda&iacute; before the previous general election, on which it has reneged. No amount of fudging can cover that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is happening. The Deputy&rsquo;s statement is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government had not reneged on its promise, more garda&iacute; would be on the beat and there would have been a reduction in petty crime, intimidation and anti-social behaviour. The blame for the continuation of these crimes lays firmly at the door of the Government due its failure to deliver on its promise. The additional garda&iacute; have not been recruited and trained nor are they on the street. They cannot contribute to the enforcement of law and order because they have not been recruited as a result of the Government&rsquo;s failure to meet its commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is completely off the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could do the State a service by tackling this issue and delivering improvements to make the lives of people worth living again. The provision of extra, fully resourced garda&iacute; is the solution, not the introduction of more legislation. Legislation is not a high priority for criminals and they do not generally consult the Statute Book to ensure their activities comply with the law. We have enough legislation but we do not have enough properly resourced garda&iacute;.</P><Col N="1611"/>
      <P>Section 33 places a duty on local authorities. This is a waste of time because local authorities do not have the capacity or the capability to carry out the functions delegated to them. This is another example of the insertion of a feel-good provision in legislation. It makes everybody feel good but the provision is toothless and therefore useless. It gives the impression that the principle of subsidiarity is being employed, that the people are having their say and that the closest arm of Government to the people has an input into the delivery of law and order. This is a shambolic exercise. The provision has been inserted so that, in future, when the Minister for Justice is criticised for not addressing anti-social behaviour, he or she can point to this legislation and state local authorities have a say and it is out of his or her hands.</P>
      <P>It is of no benefit to harassed citizens to see the current Minister pointing to legislation, quoting from the Statute Book and referring to previous Acts as his defence. Citizens want him to take effective action to rid the country of thugs. I have placed much emphasis on the need for extra community garda&iacute;. However, the need is obvious to all except the Government. There is also an urgent need to address more serious crime. In the lead up to the murder of Veronica Guerin, criminals were in control in Dublin. They appeared like celebrities on national television, dressed up in silly clothes and giving the two fingers to the Garda and other law enforcers. Following the terrible murder of Veronica Guerin, swift, decisive and effective action was taken and resources were provided. The law was strengthened and the balance of effectiveness returned to the Garda. Unfortunately, however, we are quickly returning to the lawlessness which existed prior to the murder of Veronica Guerin.</P>
      <P>Criminals in Dublin have the confidence to march into a bar with a machine gun, waltz through it looking for somebody who fortunately is not present, swagger out of the pub, threaten two uniformed members of the Garda and then ride off into the sunset. That is a regrettable commentary on law and order in our capital city but it is the reality under the Government. We are reverting to the days when the criminals were in control.</P>
      <P>We do not want more legislation to deal with this issue. The criminals do not &ldquo;do&rdquo; legislation. We want more garda&iacute; and better resources.</P>
      <P>From time to time one could be forgiven for feeling that we do not need any garda&iacute; at all to investigate crime and find out who the offenders are. Going by the statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to the effect that he knows who is committing the crime, who are members of illegal organisations and so on, it seems that he makes his judgment simply and solely on the basis that he knows what he knows. Now we want a Mini<Col N="1612"/>ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who will talk, spill the beans, tell us who the law-breakers are and how he knows, thereby nailing them all once and for all.</P>
      <P>Many people have been put on trial and convicted on the word of a senior garda on the basis of information available to him. However, it now appears that it is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has all that pertinent information and not the garda&iacute;. Perhaps it is time to enact one final Bill that would enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take the stand to give evidence in court so that he might finger all the law-breakers in the land in exactly the way in which senior garda&iacute; have done heretofore. One needs only the word of a high-ranking Minister, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the offender goes down. Imagine the savings to the Exchequer. There would be no protracted Garda investigations, no wasted expenditure taping Garda interviews, no forensic investigations &mdash; just a one-man crimebuster, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Section 39 of the Act, which imposes an obligation on the Garda Commissioner to supply criminal statistics to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is a total waste of time, for several reasons. First, many members of the public have formed the view that it is fruitless to report certain incidents, and those crimes that are not reported are not put on the record that the Garda might supply to the Minister. Even that will be used to put the best complexion on the figures from the point of view of the Minister of the day. We are once again talking of statistics and damned lies. The Minister recently welcomed an 11% decrease in serious crime. It was not based on all the years since the Government came to office, since that would not have suited its purposes. Such a comparison would have produced the wrong answer from its point of view. Since 2000, serious crime has risen from approximately 73,000 crimes to approximately 96,000.</P>
      <P>We need no more legislation but more garda&iacute; on the street and a Government that honours its commitments to appoint such garda&iacute; and equip them properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>We in Fine Gael want the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be the best police force in the world. That statement was made here by our spokesperson, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, some weeks ago when he was speaking on this Bill. As history shows, we were the party that set up the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we are very proud of that. We have always been very supportive, and we are often referred to as the law-and-order party, a brand and description of which I always feel very proud.</P>
      <P>To ensure that we have the best police force in the world, it must be the best resourced, something that it is not. It must be the best trained, and training is now of a very professional nature <Col N="1613"/>and improving. It must also be the best motivated. Generally speaking, it is well motivated, but there are signs that people are becoming disillusioned and that young people, when they enter the force because it is their vocation and they have always wanted to be garda&iacute;, are sometimes worn down by the back-up services, the resources and a feeling that they are operating in isolation and not receiving the right support from the Minister, the Department or this House, including representatives here. The force must also be well managed &mdash; the best managed in the world if we strive for that level of proficiency. It must be the best equipped, with cutting-edge technology and decent, modern accommodation and equipment. It is very important that we strive towards those objectives. The equipment that the Garda currently has is not adequate, and, having spoken to several garda&iacute; in Kerry, I was quite amazed at their standard of equipment. I am sure the same is true of the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Having prepared notes for this evening and looked back over some research, I feel it is worth pointing out how the garda&iacute; were set up and in what circumstances. This is the first legislation since the beginning of the State to address management and define the role of the various elements that make up the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As we know, between the War of Independence in 1919 and the truce on 11 July, there was no law here, where there was war. Negotiations were entered into, culminating in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which was signed on 6 December 1921 and ratified on 7 January 1922.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that, on 9 February 1922, the inaugural meeting of the Garda Foundation Committee took place in the Gresham Hotel under the chairmanship of Michael Staines, who was the first Commissioner. If one examines the early history of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, one can see what they went through to establish the force. It reminded me of Iraq. When the new regime there tried to set up a police force, the insurgents targeted it. That is why so many policemen in the new Iraq were slaughtered. When people queued up to be recruited, they targeted them. This country was no different, and we should not forget that. The young people who joined the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were targeted and viciously murdered. It is well worth remembering that, since it was only a little over 80 years ago. The first garda killed, on 8 November 1922, was Harry Phelan, from Mullinahone in County Tipperary. He was ruthlessly slaughtered on his way home after purchasing hurleys for a local team. In December 1923, Sergeant James Woods was murdered during an armed raid on the Garda station in Scartaglen, in my home county of Kerry. Garda Patrick Joseph O&rsquo;Halloran was shot dead in 1924 in Baltinglass, in Deputy Timmins&rsquo;s home county of Wicklow, while attempting to arrest two armed bank raiders.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The killings I have mentioned continued and eventually culminated in the assassination of Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins, who was the first Minister for Justice, while he was walking to Mass on 10 July 1927. The important decision that the Garda would be an unarmed force was taken following a training incident during the early days of the force, when a Garda recruit accidentally shot another Garda recruit. As I have said, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was established in the Gresham Hotel in February 1922. During a speech he made in D&uacute;n Laoghaire on 29 October 1923, Kevin O&rsquo;Higgins stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">There are over 600 Civic Guard stations established to date out of a total establishment which provides for 800 stations. They have done and are doing splendid work in restoring order and stability in the country. Their discipline is of a high order and gaining experience from week to week they bid fair to become as fine a force as any country in the world can show. Great credit is due to General O&rsquo;Duffy who in the most adverse circumstances built up such an admirable service for the people.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We should recognise today that the Garda has continued to make such a fine contribution since that time. We should remember those who lost their lives in the defence of this country and ensured that our freedoms are protected. Although there are exceptions, freedoms are protected and respected in this great country, generally speaking. There is a great deal of concern about the level of crime in certain areas, especially urban districts.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Bill before the House sets out to do, some garda&iacute; are concerned that the Garda is subject to more scrutiny, redress and accountability than any other public body. If one puts in place too much regulation and bureaucracy, there is a danger that garda&iacute; who are pursuing their duties, for example by investigating crime, will be more concerned with protecting themselves than with ensuring that perpetrators are punished, which should be their main goal. Garda&iacute; need to know more than solicitors about the law and its enforcement. If they do not have such knowledge, they will be totally exposed by barristers when they appear in court. Matters become more complicated as cases are moved to higher levels of the justice system.</P>
      <P>Garda&iacute; sometimes become bogged down in bureaucracy and face increased levels of paperwork because of the need to ensure that they protect themselves by complying with all legal details. One does not see many garda&iacute; on the streets because they are dealing with office work. Most garda&iacute; of my acquaintance would prefer to be on the beat, walking through estates in their local areas, for example, but it is impossible for <Col N="1615"/>them to do so because they are so busy with paperwork. Garda&iacute; were able to do the job expected of them in the past, when they did not have to deal with such high levels of paperwork and bureaucracy. They were free to police local communities, communicate with local people and offer the security that results from the presence of a garda.</P>
      <P>Garda&iacute; nowadays have to be very careful. They know they can easily be exposed if they make a mistake in their evidence. We should bear in mind that a garda can lose his or her job if he or she makes such an error. Trainee garda&iacute; are told at the start of their careers they should ensure they stay out of trouble. If they have family responsibilities, for example, it is hard to blame them if they take an over-cautious approach. They meet the bureaucratic demands imposed on them because they do not want to get into trouble, and it is great if a prosecution results at the end of that process. We should be mindful of such considerations.</P>
      <P>I would like to highlight some aspects of the Bill. I agree with the proposal to establish a Garda volunteer force, which was a Fine Gael policy during the last general election campaign. There is some confusion about the process of selecting and training people to serve on the volunteer force, however, because the relevant section of the Bill is vague and ambiguous. The Minister recently announced that the volunteer force will comprise approximately 1,400 members. Although they will not receive two years of training in the same way as mainstream garda&iacute;, it is significant that they will have the same powers as full members of the force. I ask the official from the Minister&rsquo;s office to ensure that the Minister clarifies this aspect of the matter when he responds to the debate.</P>
      <P>Given that mainstream garda&iacute; who have received two years of training may have difficulties in interpreting a raft of legislation, what chance will volunteer officers have when they try to do the same? It is important that the Minister specifies the length of time that will be spent training the volunteer members. What type of training will they be given? Can the Minister give substantive details of the training? Such details are needed if people are to be confident that the volunteer force is effective. I favour the creation of a volunteer force, as I have said, but volunteer officers should not have the same powers as ordinary members of the Garda if they have not received the same training. Fine Gael strongly believes that volunteer members should not have the same powers as permanent members unless they undergo the exact same level of training. Only then will my party be satisfied that volunteer officers should have the same powers as mainstream garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>I agree that local authorities should be involved in policing. It is important that the Garda works <Col N="1616"/>closely with local communities, as its members used to do before the demands of bureaucracy and office duties made it impossible for them to do so.</P>
      <P>While I was researching this speech, I read a document about Robert Peel who was born in 1788 and died in 1850. He devised his well-known nine principles of policing while he was establishing the London Metropolitan Police in 1829. The seventh principle is that a police force should &ldquo;maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police; the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen, in the interests of community welfare and existence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have always said we are all responsible citizens, that we are all police people. We have a duty to alert the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if we feel something is not right or if people break the law. It is impossible for the garda&iacute; to police everything and that is why it is important that the public trusts the garda&iacute; and communicates to them any suspicions about illegal activity. I hope that principle of Peel&rsquo;s, published nearly 200 years ago, can be put in place for local authorities. Sections 30 to 34 give a statutory basis for involvement of local authorities in policing matters for the first time. Interaction between local authorities and the garda&iacute; is long overdue. It is a welcome step that my party advocated in its justice policy at the last election.</P>
      <P>If communities are to experience long-term reductions in crime, local authorities must take on a dedicated oversight role in policing matters. Providing a forum for the garda&iacute; and local authorities to exchange views and co-ordinate activities will result in real benefits to local communities. It will provide an opportunity for real interaction and bring back a sense of ownership to a public that is becoming disenchanted with the criminal justice system. The interaction between the garda&iacute; and community should be brought to an even more local level, with fora including representatives from education, health boards and political parties. There is a worry that these local fora will simply become a way for politicians to influence the garda&iacute;. It is important that there is distance between Garda enforcement, duties and policy and local policy on Garda numbers and problem areas. The involvement of local authorities, however, would be a welcome development. In England and the United States, local authorities have a much greater role in policing.</P>
      <P>The ombudsman commission is welcome. Those garda&iacute; who do their duty and are committed to their jobs should not fear this. The Garda Complaints Board has been the focus of criticism for some time and does not enjoy the confidence of the entire public. It is an easy target for those <Col N="1617"/>who want to attack the garda&iacute; who say the board is the force investigating itself. I welcome, therefore, the decision to dissolve the board and opt for the ombudsman model that we have advocated for some time. The Minister should have opted for one ombudsman instead of the D&aacute;il appointing three people. We should have looked at the model in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Every effort should be made to advance the Garda station in Castleisland. If we want an example of a local unit of the force being neglected, it is to be seen in Castleisland, where garda&iacute; are being treated very poorly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. Deputy Deenihan mentioned Garda Patrick O&rsquo;Halloran who was shot in my home town, Baltinglass, in 1924. Most people would never even realise that he had existed; nothing commemorates him. He was shot while following raiders after a bank robbery in the town. Perhaps we might commemorate him as part of the Wicklow 400th anniversary celebration.</P>
      <P>Most people have welcomed this Bill but I am uneasy when more than one person does one job. The Minister might end up with bodies overlapping. There are merits to each area, such as a Garda inspectorate and ombudsman commission, and the Commissioner being more accountable, but I am uneasy about where the Commissioner will end up. Will he spend his time looking over his shoulder at all of these bodies keeping a watchful eye on him instead of doing his job? We all welcomed the establishment of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, thinking it would bring medical services to the people, but it turned out to be a fiasco. If I could reclaim the hours I spent on the telephone chasing Billy and Jack, I would have a great deal of valuable time on my hands.</P>
      <P>The major shortcoming in the Bill is that it does not deal with accountability. We can produce crime statistics and extract any message we want from them. The present Government parties were great at this when they were in Opposition. At a time when crime figures were decreasing, they created the impression that they were increasing. We get the spin every time statistics are released now that headline crime is down but from what I see, crime has increased. I have tabled questions about my constituency that bear this out. In Blessington, in 2000 there were 120 crimes across all headings, with 40 detected. Last year there were 160 crimes with 40 detected. The detection rate had decreased by 30% while crime had increased by 30%. Until we can have uniform crime statistics published every month, where we can compare X in one month with X+Y or X-Y the following month, we will never have true accountability. The Commissioner could be brought in once the Bill is enacted and told that his performance had improved or declined. The <Col N="1618"/>Bill, however, has two aims: to deal with the administration and management of the Garda and to establish the ombudsman commission and the inspectorate.</P>
      <P>I have great admiration for the Garda. When we talk about arms of the State, the Garda or the Defence Forces, we think in the abstract but all members of these bodies    have families and suffer the same fears and anxieties as other members of the public. They have been trained to deal with situations but they are human with all that entails. They are not infallible. The vast majority do much good and are admired by everyone in society but as is the case in the areas of education, politics and the media, a small number of them let the side down. While those few bad apples must be dealt with in the most severe terms, it is unhealthy for us as a society to regard their behaviour as a reflection of the general well-being of a particular force.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We have heard reports of what happened in Donegal, where explosives were found on a farm, yet no one in headquarters asked why the farmer was never brought in for questioning. The mind boggles in that regard and the sooner we address those issues the better because they would shake one&rsquo;s confidence. By and large, however, I have found members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be excellent. They uphold their jobs in the best tradition of the force.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with various aspects, one of which is the security of the State. That is a difficult task for a Garda force and an area in which we do not provide sufficient resources in terms of properly securing the State. Apart from a certain intelligence gathering ability, there is very little the Garda can do protect the security of the State. There is very little the Defence Forces can do to deal with an outside threat.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with preventing crime. During lunch time I visited the National Library, something I used to do before I entered politics &mdash; I have only done it on one occasion since I became a Member. I was reading some old newspapers and by chance I came across a report about the late Robert Briscoe, whom I assume is the father of the former Member, Ben Briscoe, who was speaking at a Fianna F&aacute;il meeting in Bray in 1928. He complained that one could talk in the D&aacute;il for three hours and not get three lines about it in the newspaper the following day. He may have been speaking in the context that he felt he did not have an arm of the media through which to vent his views, perhaps at a time before the <i>Irish Press</i> was established. Incidentally, another Deputy at the meeting complained about the state of the roads in west Wicklow, and that holds true today.</P>
      <P>With regard to the prevention of crime, we could intervene at a very early stage in the area of education. I have articulated that view in the House for many years but it has fallen on deaf ears. I tabled parliamentary questions on it to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, because I got the <Col N="1619"/>impression that some civil servants had travelled abroad to examine the correlation between dyslexia and crime. Statistics are available to back that up. A Channel 4 documentary on a juvenile delinquent centre in Scotland indicated that the rate of dyslexia among the residents was in the region of 50% whereas the national average was between 4% and 8%. That is a problem we have done very little to address. Many people who are ostracised by society because they cannot fit into our education system strike back by carrying out violent acts.</P>
      <P>Some evidence emerged recently from schools in Waterford where pupils had difficulties in certain mainstream schools. When they went to a school that recognised and dealt with those problems, however, the behaviour of those individuals, who now felt part of an inclusive society, improved dramatically. I ask the Minister to examine that area in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science. My understanding is that until recently there was nothing on the primary education curriculum to assist teachers in identifying the condition of dyslexia. Until a few years ago, the individual was sent to the back of the classroom because it was deemed that their intelligence level was not very high, that they could not manage and that nothing could be done to assist them.</P>
      <P>There is mention of road traffic offences in the Bill. This is an area that should be taken out of the control of the Garda. The possibility of setting up a road traffic force has been mooted. I ask the Minister to consider before Committee Stage whether it is advisable to enshrine in legislation the concept of garda&iacute; dealing with road traffic offences. It is only part of their job. I often feel they just want to keep up the rate of summons. I am aware from speaking to some superintendents that garda&iacute; go out on the busiest stretch of road and stop poor individuals like myself doing 37 mph in a 30 mph zone or the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who was caught a few times by speed cameras, as he proudly admitted. It can happen to anyone. Some of the more serious traffic incidents are missed because garda&iacute; are trying to reach their quota of summons issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether one breaks the law by one mile or 50 miles, one deserves the punishment that goes with the crime. Garda&iacute; should not involve themselves in the administration of road traffic offences.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the appointment of the Garda Commissioner. It is often said on some of the popular chat shows that the Garda Commissioner should be appointed from outside the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I would be very much opposed to that. That is akin to saying the Taoiseach should be appointed from outside politics. Politi<Col N="1620"/>cal representatives are elected by the public. The best person for the job is someone from the Garda force. It is important that position remains within the remit of the Garda because a garda, through his or her involvement with the force over many years, attains certain skills which someone even from another security background could not match.</P>
      <P>Section 14 deals with the volunteer force, a subject alluded to by previous speakers. While I welcome the principle I am concerned that the standing of the garda&iacute; would be undermined by a force that may not have met the same training requirements but yet have the same powers. That area must be examined. If such a force had the same powers as the garda&iacute;, what is the point in training the garda&iacute; to a different level or <i>vice versa</i>? I would be wary of giving this force the same powers as the garda&iacute;. There must be a demarcation line in terms of powers, otherwise some garda&iacute; will be better trained than others and that will undermine the morale of the main force.</P>
      <P>Section 15 deals with a form of attestation, the swearing of allegiance and a commitment by garda&iacute; not to involve themselves in any political party or secret society. It is difficult to get people involved in political parties nowadays &mdash; I would not say there is a great demand for that but it is important that members of the Garda are impartial. They started off in very difficult circumstances, as outlined by my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, and they have rightly remained politically neutral, irrespective of the Government in power. They work to the best of their ability for the Minister for Justice of the day.</P>
      <P>Section 16 deals with a code of ethics. Perhaps it is the way society has evolved, but I listened to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government talk about enshrining in the guidelines the need for planners to be courteous. There may be some basis for that. We can all argue individual cases but it is a sad day when we have to enshrine in codes of practice the need to be courteous to people. In terms of the garda&iacute;, we can all relate our own bad experiences, but for every bad experience, we have had 100 good experiences.</P>
      <P>Section 18 deals with civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I note from the Disability Bill that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is excluded from the requirement that 3% of the force be made up of people with disabilities. I hope the Minister will allow a certain number of people with disabilities to apply and be appointed to the various civilian positions. Perhaps that aspect should be addressed in the Disability Bill rather than this Bill &mdash; the Minister&rsquo;s official might take a note of it.</P>
      <P>Sections 19 to 22, inclusive, deal with the concept of the Minister having an operational input into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. One sees danger when one reads that. Is it right that a politician should direct the Garda Commissioner? The Minister is given stringent powers over the Commissioner. There are pros and cons. Many Members com<Col N="1621"/>plain about the way politicians have handed over power to, say, Bord F&aacute;ilte, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and so on and that we should take responsibility for political actions. If the Minister is behaving in an improper manner and not in the best service of the people, there is a forum here for him to be dealt with and, ultimately, the public can deal with him. In the current scenario the Minister always retorts to parliamentary questions by saying he does not have operational responsibility. It may not, therefore, be a bad approach in the grand scheme of things. I hope Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will adopt a sensible approach, irrespective of who they are, which does not involve changing things radically. I do not mean we should never make changes, but change for its own sake or to make a mark can be dangerous.</P>
      <P>Sections 21 and 29 deal with two hobby horses of mine, one of which involves the geographic areas of responsibility of the Garda. I assume Garda districts as currently established were created at the foundation of the State, a matter which must be addressed. I recommend change on a county basis, especially in the outlying areas outside Dublin. There are three or four superintendents with responsibility for different parts of County Wicklow which makes it very difficult to discover who is in charge. The public do not know who their local superintendent is unless it is in a rural area where he or she is long established. It is difficult to provide accountability in such circumstances. I hope the Commissioner will, with the approval of the Minister, consider redrawing the areas of operational responsibility of the various districts along county lines. Redrawn districts would be much more beneficial and would allow people to identify more readily the areas of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Section 29 deals with the distribution of garda&iacute;. In the Wicklow-Wexford area, there is approximately one garda for every 730 people whereas there is one for every 200 in Cork and one for every 300 in Dublin, despite the fact that the population is very tightly knit. The Commissioner must consider the redeployment of garda&iacute; under the powers granted to him in section 29. As one does not like to uproot people with family ties in an area, and we refer regularly to involving garda&iacute; in communities, graduates from Templemore should be placed in areas in which there is a low ratio of garda&iacute; in the population.</P>
      <P>If one examined the figures in detail, one would find a high ratio in Border areas, which proportion it may no longer be necessary to sustain. There are areas of rapidly increasing population in Meath, Kildare and Wicklow which have low garda numbers for purely historical reasons. That is an issue that must be addressed. Garda numbers in Greystones, Blessington and Enniskerry are low and there are some locations which do not have Garda stations. We must increase the Garda presence to allow people who come into communities to rest assured in their beds at night <Col N="1622"/>that there are adequate numbers of garda&iacute; on the streets.</P>
      <P>Section 26 deals with payment for services. I noted the recent claim by the Minister for Defence that banks will pay the Defence Forces for cash escorts in line with practice in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The section refers to the provision of services for concerts or functions at which it is deemed there may be a security or public order threat and at which large numbers may gather. I am slightly uneasy about the provisions. While it is populist to say the banks should be charged, and I like the sound of the proposal, I am concerned about the principle involved. Will it depend on the level of funding available to one whether one can purchase the services of an arm of the State? I would like to think that in a democratic republic the institutions of the State would protect any individual going about his or her routine business, be it social or otherwise.</P>
      <P>While I do not say services have been abused to date, it is up to the State to create an environment in which one can carry out routine activities. Many of the events outlined in section 26 are routine and ordinary. Some business may be able to afford to pay for Garda services and act responsibly, but others may decide to take a chance. We may end up with a ministerial directive to the effect that anyone who holds a function which will be attended by more than 100 people, such as a wedding, must have a Garda presence. What if it is the second wedding of a divorcee? While the question is a little flippant, it illustrates the point I wish to make. Where will the line be drawn and how will such events be dealt with? While supporters at a football match between Kerry and Wexford are generally very compliant, those from other counties might not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not even got to deal with the main elements of the Bill which are the inspectorate and the ombudsman. In section 31 the Minister appears to reverse the abolition of the dual mandate. It is perhaps sad that the Commissioner is required to establish a committee to liaise with the public to find out what they want. A local garda used always know what the public wanted.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see the inclusion of sections 41 and 42 which address the liability of members of the force. Very often members of the security forces have been left to paddle their own canoes when they have, rightly or wrongly, acted in the <Col N="1623"/>best interests of the State. I have seen people thrown to the wolves and left to defend their own corners. Having served with the United Nations, I welcome the recognition in the Bill of international duty. I found the garda&iacute; stationed in Pyla and Nicosia in Cyprus to be excellent at all times.</P>
      <P>I conclude by voicing my unease at the concept of having a Minister who directs a Commissioner who looks over one shoulder at the three-person ombudsman and over the other at the three-person inspectorate. It will be a little uncomfortable for a person who should operate without having to look anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to speak on it. I refer to police numbers, crime rates, detection rates and anti-social activity in my constituency and the measures which must be applied to deal with the problems we face. The measures in the Bill may go some way towards doing so. The Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Costello, has dealt with the main thrust of the Bill and outlined the party&rsquo;s position on it.</P>
      <P>My constituency encompasses the north-east corner of County Kildare, an area in which there has been a population explosion as a result of the massive zoning of land for residential development. Provision has not been made in the area for infrastructure and services at the level required for the greatly increased population. The geographically small area in question is served by three separate Garda divisions, which is a similar scenario to that outlined by Deputy Timmins. Leixlip is covered by the Dublin division, Kilcock by the Louth division and Naas and the rest of the county by the Carlow-Kildare division. The splintering of authority makes it virtually impossible to properly organise the police force to act in the public interest in the area.</P>
      <P>There is no Garda station in Leixlip, the second largest town in the constituency, with a population of 18,000. While a station has been promised since 1997, not a brick has been laid on a brick in the past eight years. There is a clear need for a new Garda division to cover the densely populated north Kildare area and provide Garda services there with the organisational focus and manpower to tackle the many problems which are currently untouched. As a result of organisational mayhem and inadequate staffing, serious difficulties have developed. Crime has increased by 53% in the Carlow-Kildare division while the detection rate of 31% is the lowest in the State. On the basis of population figures for the area, a further 100 garda&iacute; are required to bring the number of officers up to the inadequate national average. It is possible to address this problem under section 29 of the Bill. I wonder whether we need new legislation or simply increased numbers of garda&iacute; who are properly organised and deployed to serve the community. The leader of the Labour Party recently commenced a debate on the issue of anti-social behaviour. It has been <Col N="1624"/>stressed by a number of speakers that this mainly occurs in large council estates. However, that is not true of my area as there are no large council estates. At least 90% of housing there consists of private estates. The same scourge of anti-social behaviour as described in large urban areas is just as prevalent in my area with the same negative effects on the quality of life of law-abiding citizens.</P>
      <P>The form this activity takes is that public areas are colonised by young people aged between 15 and 20 years. They drink, play loud music, use loud, rough language and cause fear and annoyance to local law-abiding people. They effectively exclude others from using publicly provided facilities. We have several instances where pedestrian routes that were provided for the convenience of local residents have had to be closed permanently to put an end to the thuggery.</P>
      <P>I attended a meeting last night about a lane known as the Grove Lane which serves a large private housing estate. The residents did not speak about getting the Garda to do anything about the issue. They had given up on the possibility of the force doing anything about it as the problem had been ongoing for 20 years. They wanted to know if the lane could be closed and taken into the adjoining private properties to exclude the thuggish element. That was the only solution they could see, even though it would be a major convenience for people living in the estate to access the main street.</P>
      <P>In the private estate of Castletown in Celbridge where the residents' association sought action against the elements I have described, the chairman of the association was targeted. His car was repeatedly attacked, as was his house. The Garda was unable to assist. The man and his family had to sell up and move out. The young thugs won and now they know they are untouchable. They know there is no consequence of their actions despite that they were in breach of several different laws. The law is not being enforced. The Garda was not in a position to assist.</P>
      <P>What do the parents of these young thugs think of their children&rsquo;s actions or do they think they have any responsibility for their control? I am certain they do not think so. I am convinced they do not give a damn. It is time for the law to ensure that parents should shoulder their responsibility, know what their offspring are up to, be required to take corrective action and carry the consequences if they do not do so.</P>
      <P>It is important to state clearly that only a small minority of young people are involved in anti-social behaviour. Since they know there is no sanction and that they can get away with it, they make life miserable for a significant number of people and sometimes whole communities.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the causes or reasons behind such behaviour which have been written about in many reports. Not only am I prepared to be tough on the causes of crime, I am also prepared to be tough on the criminals or law breakers. Old women living alone, community activists or a per<Col N="1625"/>son who is singled out cannot wait for long-term solutions to changed behaviour patterns. They need the culprits dealt with today and tonight.</P>
      <P>The Garda, as it is currently organised and deployed, is incapable of dealing with this scourge. We need many community garda&iacute; patrolling housing estates and public areas. Token numbers for short periods is not a solution. Their presence and the intelligence they collect will be a major deterrent and will not require large numbers of young people to be locked up. Young vandals and thugs need to know there will be real sanctions if they transgress and that they will not get away with it. If it takes community orders, curfews or cleaning up the mess they made, so be it.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one other issue of regular public disorder which does not concern my area but is a national malaise. I refer to the pitched battles every weekend outside discos or nightclubs after they have closed. I am amazed that more people have not been killed. This occurs in every town where there is a nightclub. Garda&iacute; do not appear to be present until the battles are over and then they pick up what is left behind. One man died last weekend from such an incident. There have been many serious injuries. I have seen such battles occur in towns in the west. It happens every weekend in every town in which there is a nightclub and nothing is done about it. There is a silence around this matter as if it did not occur. There are pitched battles on the streets of Ballinrobe, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris and so on. Mullingar was in the headlines last weekend. No action is taken. The various anti-drinking measures have had no effect on this dangerous and regular activity. Some people have been killed and many have been seriously injured in these weekly confrontations. Why are these nightclubs and discos, whose activities give rise to such behaviour, allowed to continue?</P>
      <P>The Bill to reorganise the Garda is welcome. I repeat the oft-stated maxim that a police force cannot be effective if it does not have the confidence and support of the public. A great deal of work remains to be done in that regard. It would greatly help if garda&iacute; always remembered they are the servants of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, stated Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view of the existing case for fundamental Garda reform and welcomed on behalf of our party the opportunity to comment on this long-overdue, if flawed, Garda reform legislation. Deputy Crowe addressed the need to replace the Minister&rsquo;s proposed ombudsman commission with a single Garda ombudsman with equal powers to that in the Six Counties in keeping with the Good Friday Agreement strand three commitments to equivalence in human rights protections between both jurisdictions. Deputy Ferris reviewed the shortcomings of the Minister&rsquo;s proposed Garda inspectorate in Part 5 of the Bill and argued the need to establish a policing board for civilian management oversight, <Col N="1626"/>also equivalent to that proposed for the Six Counties under the Patten reforms.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal exclusively with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to establish joint policing committees as set out in Part 2, Chapter 4, sections 30 to 34, which deals with co-operation with local authorities and arrangements for obtaining the views of the public. If we want the policing service in this State to rank among the best in the world, and why would we not, it is essential that it is made accountable to the local communities it serves and works in partnership with them. It is that simple. The Sinn F&eacute;in proposals for the establishment of community policing partnerships at district level are the fundamental linchpin in our Garda reform package. It is this element on which the objective of restoring confidence in the Garda will either succeed or fail.</P>
      <P>I do not overstate the case. One can see from the extensive response from across the State to the recent call of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for submissions on community policing and the similar response to the earlier Lord Mayor of Dublin&rsquo;s commission on crime. Our party was represented on that commission by the Sinn F&eacute;in councillor, Christy Burke, and Dublin Sinn F&eacute;in made its own submission. While not all our recommendations were adopted exactly as submitted, I welcome that Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s influence is evident in the commission&rsquo;s conclusions.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides of this House know too well the widespread concerns about street violence, drug-related crime and anti-social behaviour that is not criminal but disruptive. People feel vulnerable in their homes and communities. This is not right. Everyone should have an equal right to security and this should not be dependent on one&rsquo;s wealth or social status. People deserve to rely on the Garda for assistance and protection. However, the reality is that very many, particularly in working class housing estates, do not even bother to report now because they believe that help will not be forthcoming. That is an indictment of the present situation and this legislation must contribute to changing it. A significant lack of policing obtains in working class estates, particularly in my constituency. I negotiated with the local superintendent to try to have additional foot patrols rather than just a motorised presence in these areas. We had a measure of success for a short while, but unfortunately all of that ended. There is also a significant unacceptable response from the garda&iacute; when they are called. For example, I have had many representations from constituents who phoned the Garda who complained that it took up to two hours for a garda to arrive. In some cases there were four or five hours of a delay and on a few occasions there was no response at all. That is most unacceptable. It is a problem that simply must be resolved.</P>
      <P>I have an interesting example of a large public housing estate where there were Garda patrols for a short while. We were trying to negotiate <Col N="1627"/>with the superintendent to resolve some of the policing issues. In fairness, he responded somewhat in terms of sending people along to meetings of community groups and residents associations to try to discover the issues first-hand. Apparently, however, he did not stick with that, whether because of the manpower shortages, as he claims, or whatever. Let us contrast that scenario with a recent incident where some youths from the estate threw stones at motorists on a nearby roadway. The Garda response was swift and they offered a solution to the problem. They suggested that they would erect a large fence around this significant housing scheme of 800 houses. Is that collective internment? Is that Guantanamo Bay? Is that a proper solution in such circumstances? It is not. That is a ridiculous response, altogether.</P>
      <P>Again, in a number of these housing estates there is the whole issue surrounding youths standing about drinking alcohol at corners or on the green areas. Now it is illegal to do that. Legislation and by-laws from the local authority are in place and yet the garda&iacute; do not confiscate the drink from the youths. I can understand this when it gets late into the night because it would create a riot at that point. However, one patrol car earlier on in the late afternoon or early evening, with proper manpower to confiscate the drink from the youths at that stage, would obviate the need for four patrol cars coming out in the middle of the night to try to deal with the consequences of the binge drinking that had been going on all day. There is also an issue as regards shops being permitted to sell alcohol. In areas such as this not many shops sell alcohol and it is quite easy to identify them and to whom they are selling. Unfortunately, as well as the major social issue involving the shop owners, there is a policing issue, too, to be tackled.</P>
      <P>Every village and town in the State knows only too well about the whole issue of drugs. In most of these communities we know who the drug dealers are. I do not expect the Garda to intern them but why do they not look for evidence? The public at large sees what is going on and a significant number of people are more than willing to co-operate with the Garda in terms of ending the scourge of drug dealing, particularly in large working class areas, and everywhere else as well. The problem is in every town and village and yet it is not being dealt with. My constituents regularly ask me &ldquo;why?&rdquo; Truthfully, I cannot tell them why there is not a far greater crackdown on that type of activity.</P>
      <P>What is the best way to respond to this crisis in confidence to ensure that the security needs of communities are met and that the resources the taxpayer pays into the policing service are spent in a responsible and effective way? I submit that it is not the Minister&rsquo;s ill-conceived anti-social behaviour orders nor his proposed extension of Garda powers, but the proper, accountable use of existing powers and crime prevention through <Col N="1628"/>adequate social investment, appropriate deployment of Garda resources, and the fostering of local community co-operation on policing matters that will make a difference. Certainly the community is up for it. Above all, this must be founded on a relationship of accountability and mutual trust, established at the most basic level of all, the beat level.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in therefore recommends the establishment on a statutory basis of community policing partnerships, CPPs, at Garda district level throughout the State to increase Garda transparency, to promote community trust and co-operation, and to hold the garda&iacute; fully to account to the people they serve. The relationship of accountability between district superintendent and such community-policing partnerships should be analogous to the relationship we propose between the Commissioner and policing board. In this way, the community-policing partnership would have a liaison role between the district commander and the local community, and thereby become a mechanism for both community accountability and co-operation.</P>
      <P>We propose that each local authority should establish community-policing partnerships, one per policing district, as committees of the council, on the following basis. The local authority should elect their members. The nomination process should be transparent and based on published criteria. As with the proposed policing board, the final composition should be one third elected representatives &mdash; of a cross-party nature &mdash; one third representatives from local statutory agencies, and one third from the local community and voluntary sector. Each component group should comprise at least 50% women and, with a view to increasing diversity and representation, reflect as fully as possible the actual composition of the communities in the district in terms of class, ethnicity, etc.</P>
      <P>There should be monthly public meetings between the community policing partnership and the district superintendent, at which he or she should present reports and answer questions. The CPP members in turn should have the opportunity and responsibility to reflect community concerns and priorities, and to make recommendations. There should also be a mechanism for members of the public to address questions to the superintendent at the public meetings, through the CPP chairperson. The superintendent should be required to take CPP views into account when formulating or implementing policing plans and strategies for the district.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that these community policing partnerships are based on an equal partnership approach between police and community. Their powers should not be unnecessarily limited. Appointments to the partnerships must be open to all without discrimination. They should be obliged by law to meet in public. They should provide a forum for public consultation at district level on annual policing plans. To improve transparency and public confidence, the Garda should <Col N="1629"/>make all requested information available for public scrutiny unless the CPP agrees that it is clearly in the public interest &mdash; not just police interest &mdash; to withhold such information. There should also be a requirement on Garda command to give after-the-fact explanations for actions of garda&iacute;. Each CPP should publish an annual report, including recommendations, to which the Garda Commissioner should be required to have due regard in the operational management of the service. The Minister should also be required to take notice of CPP recommendations in the formulation of policy for which he or she has responsibility.</P>
      <P>While the local policing forums that have been piloted in some areas of Dublin are a welcome step, they do not provide the right model for community accountability as they are not based on equal partnership. Existing policing forums should be converted into the new community-policing partnerships.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recognition by inclusion of the provisions at Part 2, Chapter 4 that there needs to be some level of local involvement in policing matters. I acknowledge that he seems to have taken several of our recommendations on board, although he has diluted them. However, while the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on enhanced co-operation between local authorities and the Garda represent an improvement on the present situation, they do not meet the same standards of transparency and local democratic control and accountability as the community policing partnerships Sinn F&eacute;in proposed. The newly proposed joint policing committees still do not get it right.</P>
      <P>Section 31 gives the Minister ultimate discretion in the establishment and composition of the committees. It also gives him the ultimate say on when they will meet in public and <i>in camera</i>. Section 32 prevents them from considering specific investigations or matters of public security. There is no provision requiring the Garda Commissioner or the Minister to take account of their views and recommendations.</P>
      <P>Section 34 confers on the Minister ultimate control over any arrangement for obtaining the views of the public on policing. It is not the right formula to establish the committees at local authority level, with the establishment of more local community policing fora only as an option. It remains too centralised. Local accountability and community co-operation mechanisms must coincide with the structures of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which often bear no relation to the local electoral area. Likewise, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party rejects the division level as too distant to allow proper democratic control.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposed model has also been criticised by the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. In their view the provisions of Part 2, Chapter 4 are too narrow in function and membership to put in place a community policing model. They argue the Bill does not allow for direct community input <Col N="1630"/>into policing priorities. Both have also complained that the committees proposed by the Minister will have no role in monitoring Garda performance or the protection of civil liberties. They point out that, whereas a proper community policing forum represents the community, the Bill only provides for local councillors to sit on the joint policing committees. The Irish Human Rights Commission has called for specific provisions on representation with the involvement of groups in communities with particular policing needs or which experience high levels of contact with the Garda. The commission has also called on the Minister to ensure these provisions are at least equivalent to those provided for in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>The Sinn F&eacute;in Party shares these concerns which will be addressed by our counter proposals. In view of the Minister&rsquo;s relative openness to strengthening his proposals for Garda reform, I hope he will accept our party&rsquo;s constructive amendments to strengthen the local democratic control and co-operation aspects of the proposed legislation. This will be necessary if our party is to support the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything that could be possibly said about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been said since this Bill was published. However, it is a serious matter and there are several issues that I wish to raise. I have no problem with the main thrust of the Bill; in some matters I wanted the Minister to go further.</P>
      <P>There are two fundamental issues important for the future of law and order in the State. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na earns the public&rsquo;s trust and respect. However, this can be a two-edged sword. Despite attempts by groups in society to fracture this trust, it remains to a large degree. Whatever the Garda does, it must always remember the most important ace in its hand is that the public trusts it and wants it in place on its behalf. However, if that trust and goodwill go, whether there are 12,000 or 20,000 members in the force, it will not be possible to run a democracy.</P>
      <P>It is becoming the in thing to do down the Garda, a dangerous path for society to take. There is the serious matter of some parts of Dublin city, other cities and large towns, loosely described as no-go areas for the Garda. Irrespective of what it will take on the part of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary and local community groups, there is a thin blue line between those who want to get on with their work and believe in freedom and thugs and disturbers. If the thugs get half a chance, they will wreck community life. No other group can stand on that thin blue line other than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>Like other sections in society such as politicians and the clergy, the force has come under the microscope as peculiar events have happened within it. I have enough respect, belief and confidence in it that these will be overcome. I sincerely hope we will have a police force of which we all can be proud. For every bad apple in the Garda <Col N="1631"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na there is a barrel full of good ones. I know men and women who have dedicated their lives to the job, who held their heads high from the day they became a Garda recruit until the day they retired. It is unfair to draw general conclusions because of the ridiculous carry-on of a few members of the force, irrespective of rank. The community&rsquo;s trust in the police force must be worked on intensively to ensure the continuation of the bond of friendship and contract between both.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal of a three person ombudsman commission. People argue academically whether it should be similar to the structure in place in Northern Ireland. It will, however, be much better than the existing Police Complaints Board. I do not have a dagger out for the board. I understand it did its best, working within its given remit. However, people quickly lose interest when police investigate police. I hope the proposed commission will be seen to be absolutely independent, without the slightest smell of collusion. The Minister has proposed various levels for the commission&rsquo;s remit, allowing for the difference between minor and other indiscretions. The Garda Commissioner will adjudicate on these matters. Society has come to the point where one has to define a small indiscretion. However, it must be remembered it could be a large indiscretion to the individual affected and every case, or at least the decision involved, should be vetted by the ombudsman&rsquo;s office before it is communicated to anybody. That stamp should be attached in order that it will be clear that it was independent.</P>
      <P>On many occasions members of the public have not accepted the findings of the police complaints board. However, this is a two way street. There are occasions when pressure is put on the police force and it is aggravated to a degree where people hope it will respond. A couple of years ago I was leaving the House through the Kildare Street gate. Garda&iacute; were lined up in riot gear. I forget what the demonstration was about but it was rowdy. I was standing behind the row of policemen. Two thugs, in the hope of starting a racket, spat through the vizor of a policeman&rsquo;s helmet. Imagine how degrading that is.</P>
      <P>I have not received the relevant training but if I had been that policeman, the thug would not have spat at me a second time. However, if a policeman were to react in any way other than the way he is trained to do, there would be huge trouble. The public should understand garda&iacute; are put under enormous pressure at such times. Of course, their training equips them to deal with this but nobody should forget that pressure. Where a garda, of whatever rank, steps out of line and breaks the rules, he or she should be brought to justice like every other citizen. However, there is another side to that coin. I sincerely hope, with regard to public order, that many of the thugs one sees in towns and cities will be brought to book. They are simply seeking trouble. It makes no dif<Col N="1632"/>ference to them who they hurt; they seem to get a kick out of creating trouble.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to community policing. I am a little confused about the number of garda&iacute; in the force. According to the reply to a parliamentary question a few days ago, the number is 12,200 but the Taoiseach and the Minister tell us that there are 14,000 garda&iacute;. Which figure is correct? I believe that while we might aspire to having 14,000 garda&iacute;, the current number is 12,200. Regardless of what the number is, there are not enough garda&iacute; doing the work they should be doing.</P>
      <P>It is true I do not know what happens in Dublin city at night but I do know what happens in Galway and Limerick cities and, in particular, Ballinasloe, Tuam and even small towns such as Mountbellew, where I live. It is usually a quiet peaceful place. When the doors of the discos in these big towns are opened at 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m., people flow out onto the street. They go down to the local chip shop and a fight develops. There might be 150 to 500 people there. How can one expect two or three garda&iacute; in a patrol car to impose law and order when an ugly and intense fight breaks out? It would be the most unequal row of all time. One cannot expect the garda&iacute; to win it. We must minimise the opportunities people have to congregate in that fashion. It is not a question of closing down the country. However, if a row must occur, there is a better chance of the police being there if it occurs earlier in the night.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of manpower. Take, for example, a peaceful area such as east Galway. Nearly every town and village holds discos, although on a smaller scale than in the big cities. Consider the number of garda&iacute; available at that hour of the night, taking account of the rostering system. There are four garda&iacute; in Athenry but the four are not on duty at the same time. One cannot expect them to be. They are entitled to time off like everybody else. On occasion only one garda is on duty. How can one expect one person to be in control of a town such as Athenry, given all the events that can occur during the night after a disco? The Minister should think about this. The information he is getting from the Garda Commissioner must be informing him that the stations are short of staff.</P>
      <P>When one tables a parliamentary question on this matter to the Minister &mdash; this also applies to his predecessor &mdash; the reply always states the Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that there are sufficient numbers for the job in hand. However, everybody in the country, including local garda&iacute;, says there are not enough. How is it that the Minister, his predecessors and the Garda Commissioner have the same story? Is it that when one gets to a certain level, either in government or in the force, one believes the maxim that if the resources are better utilised, one can work with the existing numbers?</P>
      <P>The Minister will say the crime figures are reducing and, thankfully, certain categories are. <Col N="1633"/>However, what about the loutish behaviour the Minister has referred to so often recently? I do not know the figures for such crime; I doubt anybody has correct figures because much of this crime is unreported. The time at which it is committed and the fact that so little is known about the perpetrators mean it is difficult to keep account of it. I believe its incidence is greatly increased. It must be nipped in the bud. A thug under 20 years of age who creates trouble on the main street of Ballinasloe and gets away with it is likely, if given a free rein, to become a major criminal by the time he is 30 years of age. By then he believes he is unstoppable.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>That brings me to the concept of community policing. Every report I have seen on policing anywhere in the world reaches the same conclusion, that there must be community police. If a garda believes he or she can be in direct contact with the community when he or she spends all of his or her time either on a telephone in an office or inside a squad car, he or she is not making progress. It is that simple. It is as if politicians had no contact with anybody. The result is that one does not have elementary information. I know some community garda&iacute;. They know almost everyone in the area and almost everything that is going on. In debates such as this during the years, some people tried to convince us that this is useless information, but it is not. The pup that creates trouble on the street in Ballinasloe, Tuam or Mountbellew and gets away with it is on to a good thing. This is where criminality starts if there is no deterrent. If we want to nip this in the bud, we must take this loutish behaviour very seriously. However we pay them, we want more police here.</P>
      <P>There is Garda involvement with young people in the school warden schemes and other types of youth work. Some people suggest that such activity is Garda time badly spent. I have the opposite view. When I spoke about trust, I was referring to that wonderful connection that people have with people they can trust. There is no better time to develop trust than when people are young, have no preconceived ideas and take people at face value. There is nothing better than a policeman training school wardens for a couple of hours. I hope the youth programmes in which garda&iacute; are involved will be maintained and intensified in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to use the opportunity of speaking on this Bill to invite the Minister to revisit issues on urban crime and disorder, especially in the greater Dublin area and in my constituency of Dublin West. I have debated these issues with the Minister on a number of occasions. I know he has been learning and he may now know a bit more about anti-social behaviour in the community. Communities around the country, particularly in urban areas, are enduring a misery that is beyond belief. We often speak about the Celtic tiger and the wel<Col N="1634"/>come progress made economically since around 1993-94. However, for many people, the cancer of anti-social behaviour has destroyed the greater economic resources. The lack of community policing and a Garda patrolling service on the streets of cities, towns and villages is destroying the capacity of people to live wholesome lives.</P>
      <P>This week, we had the culmination of a series of killings in Dublin, one of those in Dublin 15. There is a real sense of impunity among criminal gangs under this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One of the criminal perpetrators in the Ongar area could stand undisguised in a neighbourhood for a number hours stalking and waiting for the victim whom he then shot to death. The Minister held an earlier predecessor of his, the former Deputy Owen, personally responsible every time a post office was robbed. Killers are now walking the streets with guns, stalking their victims in broad daylight in an area in which thousands of young people have committed their life savings to purchase new homes. These are scenes we might have seen in &ldquo;Gangs of New York&rdquo;. This is the type of policing and deterrence that the current Government has given us, in spite of the fact that it once promised zero tolerance. It is hardly bearable.</P>
      <P>A report was published yesterday on the Tallaght area that was part of a larger study, the first part of which was published six months ago. I attended the presentation and I am not sure if anyone from the Progressive Democrats Party was present. There may have been members of the Garda present. The study listed the fears of young children, who are supposed to be growing up cherished by this society. They feared people with drugs and guns hanging around playgrounds and approaches from drug pushers in schoolyards. It also referred to the fears of these children as they listened to joy-riders at night on the streets of west Dublin. Some of these children have probably never spoken to a garda or met a garda in the school classroom. I agree completely with Deputy Connaughton. The presence of garda&iacute; in the community is not a waste of time, as children can get to know the garda&iacute; and begin to feel safe in their own community, as ought to be the case.</P>
      <P>The experience of anti-social behaviour in our communities can be far worse than the experience of sectarianism, sexism or racism. Much anti-social behaviour also spirals into those areas. There is a crisis in Ireland with anti-social behaviour and the rule of impunity that currently seems to exist. Gun crime relates to anti-social behaviour because the criminal gangs that have easy access to guns are also the godfathers that have a disproportionate influence in working class housing estates. These godfathers can push drugs in housing estates partly because they have guns and because they are making so much money out of crime. They can walk with a swagger in areas ordinary people cannot as there is no visible community policing presence in the area.</P><Col N="1635"/>
      <P>I raised this issue with the Minister in November 2003. Has the Minister had an opportunity to revisit this issue? I spoke about the murder of a young man in a pub in Corduff. I spoke about a nurse who was car-jacked outside her own home in west Dublin. I also spoke of a new estate of affordable, social and private housing called Castlecurragh, where gangs of young kids terrorising people was making life very difficult for the residents. I then asked, in terms similar to those outlined by Deputy Connaughton, for serious community policing to become a critical aspect of our strategic approach to crime and harm reduction. In the course of that Adjournment debate, the Minister stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Now we have it. The Deputy is talking about garda&iacute; on the beat. However, we are dealing with armed and homicidal gangs. The answer is not to put more garda&iacute; wandering around estates in the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency. It is deluding the people. The Garda is doing a good job. It is doing its level best to combat all incidences of crime.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">That debate took place on 4 November 2003. Because of the campaign I have waged in Dublin West, I am glad to state that when the Minister responded to me about two months ago he had assigned 20 new recruits from Templemore to the Dublin West area because of the problems encountered there. I commend garda&iacute; in Dublin West, including the newly qualified recruits from Templemore, some of whom are probably terrified walking around some local authority estates in pairs. However, where they are visible, the community response is to feel more secure, even if only momentarily. Will the Minister give a commitment that such patrols will remain for at least three years, as recommended in the Patten report as it related to Northern Ireland? That is what is essential.</P>
      <P>What is the point of having money in Celtic tiger Ireland if a young person buys a new car which is destroyed by thugs? What is the point of a young person starting a home and family if he or she has no peace of mind? What is the point of an elderly person living in an area if he or she is afraid to answer the door at night because thugs invade the front garden to sit, drink and perform various unspeakable actions? When someone telephones the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there is no response. Neither can he or she obtain information on the response times for this type of criminality which is destroying the quality of people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      <P>Since that Adjournment debate, the Minister has had 18 months in which to come to terms with the fears stalking our society. The problems stemming from anti-social behaviour are particularly acute for those who live alone, lone female parents and their teenage daughters, the elderly, non-nationals and anyone considered by thugs to be different. The latter category could include ambitious children who are successful at school <Col N="1636"/>and go home with bags full of books because they are academic and studious. What we might celebrate as something wonderful for the child&rsquo;s education could lead to him or her being marked out for harassment and bullying by thugs in an estate. In addition, the family home might be set upon by such thugs.</P>
      <P>The community garda is the Cinderella of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Such garda&iacute; can easily be isolated, are viewed with a certain condescension by other colleagues, and seen as a ready source of surplus manpower to be deployed elsewhere when needed. For a long time people in Dublin West have been familiar with this phenomenon. If anything happens on the Border, our community garda&iacute; vanish to attend such events.</P>
      <P>Experience in other countries has more than amply demonstrated the importance of keeping a community or neighbourhood policing service separate from the routine of ordinary policing. While an arrest may well be a sign of success in the mainstream Garda service, in community policing it may be seen as an admission of failure because the role of community garda&iacute; is to deter offenders and thus prevent offences from being committed in the first place. Therefore, a low arrest rate by community garda&iacute; may not be reckoned to be a sign of success within Garda management systems as organised by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>The community policing service is the key to crime prevention and potentially a powerful tool in containing anti-social behaviour. What is needed is more effective training, longer assignments to the task &mdash; as set out in the Patten report &mdash; and a greater recognition of the importance of community policing. In addition, there should be greater recognition, for promotion purposes, of those community garda&iacute; involved at the coalface. All these elements are essential if the community policing service is to get the recognition it deserves. Evidence in other jurisdictions shows that putting garda&iacute; back into the community is the only serious way of tackling the epidemic of anti-social behaviour and related crime.</P>
      <P>A handbook is required on community policing. The law relating to anti-social behaviour and the remedies available to its victims are complex and varied. There is an urgent need to bring together the legal processes open to the police and the public in the form of a handbook which could serve both as a guide for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and an information base for citizens.</P>
      <P>A reduction in response times and greater use of foot patrols would amount to an evident management strategy which would encourage people, many of whom consider reporting minor offences to be a waste of time, to relate more effectively to garda&iacute;. It would also enable garda&iacute; to improve their often inadequate knowledge of, and intelligence on, areas for which they are responsible.</P>
      <P>Young people are commonly robbed of their mobile phones by little thuggish yobbos wearing hoodies. It is a traumatic experience for young people and terrifying for their parents because if <Col N="1637"/>such thugs were confronted, who knows what serious physical injury might be inflicted on their teenage victims? During the Minister&rsquo;s time in office we have seen murder cases in which teenagers were killed for their mobile phones. That is how bad the situation has become. The Minister must accept some responsibility for what has been happening.</P>
      <P>During the past year I sent a young member of my own family to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but they did not get a response. The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor talked about zero tolerance but I am talking about zero response. How can teenagers build a relationship with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if when they report a mugging or robbery, they receive no response? This is dysfunctional management of policing by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Garda performance criteria are skewed to encourage a focus on medium gravity crimes, including burglary and car theft &mdash; offences which yield primary and secondary clear-ups. The Garda practice of &ldquo;cuffing and stuffing&rdquo;, the non-recording of certain calls for service and the over-recording of certain offences is largely driven by assessment criteria. A change of criteria is needed to include a focus on community offences which might be seen as less serious but which lead to the broken windows phenomenon and estates becoming no-go areas for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and go-go areas for paramilitaries. Without community policing, one&rsquo;s friendly neighbourhood paramilitary is likely to offer to fill the gap. People like me are left at public meetings saying vigilantism is no answer, yet people&rsquo;s rage is so great that they will look for any remedy which appears to dispel some of the horror they experience.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister has learned a little more about the crisis confronting so many working-class communities and the abject failure of the Government to make a serious response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted with the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I hope when it is implemented there will be some major changes within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. They are badly needed. The manner in which the Garda protects the people is close to my heart.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the Bill and the prospect of community policing. Our society has changed dramatically in recent years. Crimes that were crimes five or ten years ago remain crimes but we are now seeing certain types of anti-social behaviour. Deputy Burton and another Labour Party Member drew attention this morning to the hooded youngsters of whom people are frightened.</P>
      <P>The primary duty of garda&iacute; is to protect people. Like all in public life, including the parish priest and politicians, garda&iacute; have a job to do, but some garda&iacute;&mdash; a very small number &mdash; who go through the Templemore training system, who get through interviews and pass their exams, seem to forget their primary duty of protection, especially when they are assigned to Garda stations.</P><Col N="1638"/>
      <P>Since I became involved in politics in 2002, I have spoken to local garda&iacute; every two weeks or so, more than I did three or four years ago. If a garda trainee enters Templemore at the age of 23, 24 or 25, he or she will have been out in the world, and will perhaps have gone to college or had a job. Such people have a different outlook from other trainees and theirs is the proper outlook because they know what goes on outside and have some common sense. Some of the trainees who go to Templemore direct from second level education are inclined to throw the book at people, to imagine they are in charge, and superior to others. That is a wrong way to behave.</P>
      <P>A garda must find out what is happening in the community. A garda who has been out on the streets and has been around can find out more by chatting to people, rather than throwing the book at them, catching them going too fast through 30 mph zones or targeting a person who has perhaps had more than one pint. I feel strongly about that. Garda training must be reconsidered in terms of what they might have been engaged in before entering Templemore.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael members were the founders of the State and of the Irish police force. I am proud to be in the party which founded a force which protects people. I am in favour of community policing in villages, parishes, towns and cities, because people have an important role in that area. When I think of community policing, however, I recall the time when councillors were on health boards. I do not want to see mere talking shops developing.</P>
      <P>The Lord Mayor of Dublin issued a report on crime and policing on 7 February last. He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">People want to see garda&iacute; on the beat. They want to hear their feet on the streets, not their sirens as they speed past in cars with flashing lights. They want more judges in district courts so that all low level crime, disorder and anti-social cases will be speedily dealt with. They want local authorities, the garda&iacute;, the courts and health and educational services to work together to target and reduce unacceptable behaviour like public drinking, drug-taking, late-night noise and other intimidating anti-social behaviour that affects so many communities in the city.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Lord Mayor went on to say that the report was based on a number of submissions and that 40 focus groups had strongly urged that reducing crime, disorder or anti-social behaviour could not be the sole responsibility of the garda&iacute; and the courts. That is where community policing can work.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received the report from the Lord Mayor he said:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am glad to be here to receive the commission&rsquo;s report. The Lord Mayor is to be congratulated on his initiative in establishing the commission on crime and policing and the wide-ranging consultation it undertook with <Col N="1639"/>agencies &mdash; and most importantly, the residents of this city &mdash; must be commended. I am struck by the fact that the commission was set up only in September and completed its report on a wide range of topics in February.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P LI="1">I will carefully study the recommendations contained in the report. Already, a number of them, particularly those relating to the need for more garda&iacute; on the beat, have struck a chord with me and indeed echo my own priorities for additional garda&iacute; who will be coming out of Templemore over the next three years.</P>
      <P FLI="0">When I stood for election in 2002, those extra 2,000 garda&iacute; were promised. In 2005, we still have not seen them. What people want is just as the Minister stated &mdash; more garda&iacute; on the streets. People feel safer if they see a man in a Garda uniform perhaps walking through an estate or a busy shopping centre or whatever it may be. If community policing is to be successfully introduced, there must be more garda&iacute; on the streets.</P>
      <P>I meet my local Garda superintendent regularly to discuss crime levels, anti-social behaviour, or perhaps under-age drinking, or drug abuse, or whatever is going on in my home town, Enniscorthy. The superintendent points out that many garda&iacute; are regularly tied up in different cases, perhaps following those involved in drugs or drug trafficking, or a major crime gang. Garda&iacute; follow so many crime investigations that they are totally tied up. They have not got sufficient numbers in the Garda station or on the rosters to walk the streets.</P>
      <P>When I spoke to the newly appointed superintendent in Enniscorthy, Peter Finn, he said he wanted to see garda&iacute; walking the streets. He has done this and I have seen an improvement, on which people have commented to me. If they see a garda walking the street a few times each week, they feel safer. At first they asked if there was something wrong when they saw a garda on the street because we do not have the number required to have garda&iacute; walking the streets and talking to people to hear what is going on.</P>
      <P>The Community Alert scheme was initiated to cope with rural crime and robberies on a daily basis. I come from a rural area in County Wexford where not a week goes by without hearing of someone&rsquo;s house being robbed or broken into and not a weekend goes by without reading about a crime in the local or national newspapers. If I read any national newspaper today, I am sure I will read a story about some rural community where someone was robbed or tied up. The reason for this is that the system of rural policing has fallen apart.</P>
      <P>Most of the Garda stations in the Enniscorthy area, for example, are manned for only two or three hours a day. I raised this matter in a parliamentary question in which I asked about the number of garda&iacute; in rural stations. The Minister has no plans to increase their number. The <Col N="1640"/>population of Ferns, Kiltealy and many other villages dotted around County Wexford and throughout the country has increased dramatically but the number of garda&iacute; has decreased.</P>
      <P>Bunclody is a perfect example. It is now a medium-sized town but does not have a full-time Garda station. If there is an emergency in the area, garda&iacute; must travel almost 20 miles from Gorey. If, God forbid, thieves were to enter a house in Bunclody tonight, shoot the occupants and disappear with their belongings, how long would it take garda&iacute; to get to the scene from Gorey? This is what is happening across the country because criminals are aware of the situation. Whether thieves come from Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford or County Mayo, they know it will take over half an hour for garda&iacute; to arrive at the scene. They have it so well planned that they get in, take what they want and get away. The same could and has happened in the middle of the day. A year or two ago a bank robbery took place in Bunclody but by the time garda&iacute; got to the scene the thieves were gone with the money. There was nothing the garda&iacute; could do.</P>
      <P>Those involved in the Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch schemes must be commended but it is not their job to keep an eye on what is happening; that is what garda&iacute; are paid to do. However, they do not have the resources or the numbers to do so. My parish, Bree, has a strong Community Alert group. Its members received no grant assistance to erect signs but had to go around and collect money from people residing in the parish. Only a small number are interested in such organisations, often older people. When they become too old or ill to take part, there will be nobody to replace them.</P>
      <P>A press release from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, a Wexford Deputy, stated it was scandalous garda&iacute; were not involved in local GAA clubs and did not live in the parishes they policed. I agree. However, I would not like to see it included on the Garda application form that a person applying should become a member of the local GAA club and involved in training soccer teams, or, in the case of a female applicant, a member of the ICA. That happened 20 years ago. In fairness, garda&iacute; must be able to get away from their work. We must face reality. Members of the force are not as actively involved in community organisations as they once were but that is their business. They have their job to do. If they want to become involved in the local GAA club, that is up to them; they should not have to become involved.</P>
      <P>The complaint I hear about garda&iacute; is that people have to wait for half an hour or an hour for them to turn up. People also complain that they do not see garda&iacute; walking the street. These complaints all boil down to garda resources. The story of what happened in Gorey and Courtown Garda stations illustrates this. Both had cars that were involved in accidents and written off. In the <Col N="1641"/>case of Courtown, it took over two and a half months for the car to be replaced while in Gorey it took almost three months. The red tape involved in obtaining a new car or having one replaced is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>We know garda&iacute; have a tough job. Many of them should be commended. We see them on duty at weekends and they often take their life in their hands. Nobody knows when a knife will be pulled outside a nightclub or in a street brawl. Earlier somebody said the only time they ever saw garda&iacute; was when the rows were over. If 30 or 40 fellows are hammering each other on the street, full to their eyes with drugs and drink, it is difficult for two, three or four garda&iacute; to break them up. If I was a garda, I would not even try. I recall being outside a nightclub as a fight took place and the bouncers had to get involved to help the garda&iacute; carry out their duty. That is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I cannot stress enough the importance of tackling anti-social behaviour. It is a major issue in every city, town, village and parish and the situation will be out of control if something is not done to address it quickly. I do not know if community policing will solve the problems caused by anti-social behaviour but it must be tackled head on. Increased Garda numbers would help. When the new recruits have been trained and deployed on our streets, I hope they do not become tied up in various investigations because a visible Garda presence is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I congratulate on his appointment, the new Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, who is originally from County Mayo. Last Saturday night he was honoured in his native county when he was selected Erris Person of the Year. It was my first opportunity to meet him. I saw him in action in the Oireachtas and on television in regard to an operational matter and I was impressed by his performance. He acquitted himself well. He presents a good image of the Garda. Garda&iacute; in the past were more interested in the night life than in doing their jobs. I wish Noel Conroy well in a difficult appointment at a difficult time for the Garda.</P>
      <P>On community policing, I am disappointed the legislation does not include a provision to make it compulsory on new recruits to the Garda to reside in the area to which they are assigned. That would be a step in the right direction and it must happen. I accept the Minister may not be able to do anything where recent recruits are concerned but future recruits should have to live where they are assigned. In the past garda&iacute; lived in the areas in which they worked. They gathered information locally and they knew what was going on. Part of the problem nowadays is that people in many towns and villages do not know their local garda&iacute;. This issue should be examined. Perhaps the Minister might consider making it part of the conditions for new recruits when they sign on the dotted line so that if they are assigned to West<Col N="1642"/>port, Castlebar or Ballina, for example, they must live in those towns and cannot expect to be able to travel from Galway and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Previously, small Garda stations were open in every town and village. The population was smaller and there was less crime but rural Garda stations are being closed and garda&iacute; are consolidated in cities and towns leaving rural areas unpoliced. That is wrong and this policy should be re-examined. I am not saying every rural Garda station should be reopened but a reasonable compromise should be reached. For example, my area covers Louisburgh to Westport, a distance of 13 miles. There used to be Garda stations in Westport, Murrisk and Louisburgh but the one in Murrisk has been closed. That is fine because it is only four miles from Westport. However, the population in these towns and villages has increased and more people are moving into rural areas.</P>
      <P>The town planners are pushing more people into housing estates, resulting in increased levels of anti-social behaviour. Every week at my clinic, people are looking for transfers from local authority housing not because they do not like their houses or the area but because they cannot live there because of the activities of young people who are involved in anti-social behaviour and whose parents do not control them. That is a major problem we must examine, as a society. This cannot continue. Young people are on the streets at all hours and their parents do not control them. The time has come to make parents responsible for young children who are creating havoc in every town and village.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Garda ombudsman commission and policing committees. I have always said politicians should not investigate politicians and garda&iacute; should not investigate garda&iacute;. I hope the commission will work and that there will be a little independence in the system. In the past, the investigation of complaints against garda&iacute; by garda&iacute; has not worked. The ombudsman will be given the power and resources to investigate complaints. That is welcome. Equally, however, people who make dishonest complaints should pay a serious price because they waste valuable resources and time. If a complaint is made, sometimes it cannot be fully investigated and finalised and there may be a doubt. That is fine but the issue of people making dishonest complaints against garda&iacute;, usually when they are facing a prosecution, must be examined.</P>
      <P>I hope community policing will work. I was a member of Westport Urban District Council for more than 20 years and the one complaint we received every week related to the lack of garda&iacute; on the street. Another problem we had was the regular transfer of superintendents in and out of the town. We had three or four superintendents in a three year period. That was neither good for policing nor the morale of the local force. However, that has been addressed and the current superintendent has been in the town for a <Col N="1643"/>good while. The one job he did well was to put policemen on the street day and night. One can walk through Westport at any time and a Garda presence is visible. This presence has addressed late night problems in the town. The people were right. That is what they wanted, that is what they got and it has worked. I hope that will happen in every town and village.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>I recently spoke to a garda based in a city who said he was dealing with drug addicts all the time but the only protection he received was an anti-hepatitis C injection. These times are different; we are dealing with different people. The necessary resources should be given to the Garda. It is time we considered the uniform, in particular to ensure garda&iacute; have the right headgear. There are now people with no respect for life or human beings who do not mind injuring anyone. It is time we examined the equipment garda&iacute; use, especially regarding drug addicts, to ensure they are protected by gloves or whatever else they need.</P>
      <P>I learned when I travelled to County Meath during the recent by-election campaign that everyone in the country had a jeep and that they were being stolen. Fellows are driving around in high powered jeeps and cars. The term used for them is &ldquo;joy-riders&rdquo; but they do not give much joy to a family when they kill someone in an accident on the road. That is not a great joy and the name should not be used by the media. They are not joy-riders but thugs. They steal high powered vehicles, drive them through the streets of cities and towns and kill people with them.</P>
      <P>Being a garda is becoming an ever more difficult job. Like politics, it is not easy to satisfy everyone. At the same time, however, we depend on them. When there is a problem and we call them, we expect them to be there. When a problem arises in the shape of serious or petty crime, we depend on them. We must give them the necessary resources and manpower. That is what was done in New York where they started dealing with anti-social behaviour and petty crime. They also had to deal with serious crime. They knew that the police force and Government were serious about tackling crime and that where there was a problem, it would be dealt with from the bottom. It is important we send that message in this country. We want the best police force in the world, the best equipped and the most honest. We want the people to be protected as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking about opening caf&eacute;s. I know that it is a different Bill and that there will be another agenda and another day&rsquo;s debate on the drink culture in this country but the most serious problem facing the State is the abuse of drink and drugs. I put drink first and drugs second. The single biggest mistake we ever made was extending the licensing laws. It has created a major problem in the country. I know it is not <Col N="1644"/>popular to say this since there is a major lobby group. I know I will have my critics on licensed premises where this might not go down too well but we must be honest that the abuse of alcohol is the single greatest challenge we face.</P>
      <P>We have dealt with the smoking ban and must now deal with the abuse of alcohol. We must address it as a society and should not be afraid to do so since it is creating much of the crime, violence and anti-social behaviour experienced. The time has come for the Government to take this issue on, just as it did with the smoking ban. Like smoking in pubs and other public places, we must make it unacceptable to abuse drink. Whether we like it, we must also tackle off-licences regarding their opening hours and how drink is sold. Pubs may have lost business since the smoking ban but if they have, consumption has not decreased. This is certainly affecting matters. Drink is being consumed but where it is being drunk is another matter. We must examine this matter and if we deal with it, we will tackle a great deal of crime.</P>
      <P>I agree with the community policing end of the Minister&rsquo;s Bill and hope it works. It is important to have the community involved to ensure local people know what is going on, particularly in the protection of the most vulnerable elderly people. I remember that at one time in rural Ireland we had people coming in, robbing the elderly and driving out in the middle of the night. I remember people going to bed in daylight and not getting up again until dawn because they were afraid to let anyone into their homes. We must never allow that to happen again. That is why it is important we give the Garda the necessary resources and manpower. The Minister must honour the commitment he gave regarding 2,000 extra garda&iacute; who must be put on the beat to do their job, namely, protect the general public and taxpayers.</P>
      <P>That is essentially all I have to say. I hope the Bill works, since it is important for us all that we have a good, honest police force and that people feel, when they make a complaint, that it is destined to be listened to by someone independent who will adjudicate on it. We have excellent garda&iacute; but there is no point in our pretending that there are not members in the force who should not be in it. If they create a problem, they should be removed. If they are not doing their job or breaking the law, they should be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to speak on crime regarding my experiences during my successful by-election campaign. It amazed me, living in a nice, quiet area at one end of the county, when I moved on to built-up areas such as Dunshaughlin, Ratoath, Ashbourne and even Navan to learn that the crime rates in those areas were far higher than in my own. We can always blame young people for crime but I have been involved in sports activity for 23 years and everywhere one is involved in sport, crime is not even an issue. People have something to do, whether they are <Col N="1645"/>senior or junior footballers, lady footballers or handballers. Anywhere one has sports facilities, there is no crime. The one thing that really annoyed me during my campaign was that in all those built-up areas no one saw fit, if one had 20 houses or 100 children, to provide enough sports facilities for young people.</P>
      <P>It is out of boredom and perhaps a lack of policing that young people get involved in crime. I always find that, no matter at what age, a young fellow will go through a rough patch, like we did ourselves somewhere between the ages of 18 and 21 years. One can be led astray but it is very easy to get back if something is put in front of one instead of gangs or drugs. There will always be 5% or 10% of people who do not want to comply with any rules or regulations. They are the people who must ultimately be targeted &mdash; the likes of the drug dealers and those who simply do not want to be part of society.</P>
      <P>To my amazement, drug dealers and others involved in crime are getting away too lightly. Their sentences are too short. The excuse that we do not have the prisons to hold them is not good enough. It is very easy to rob a bank or put a gun to someone&rsquo;s head. The next thing one sees is that they receive a four year suspended sentence. They must be put away. A gun is a good thing in its own right and I blame the person who handles it for the crime. It is up to the Government and us in opposition, to promote more sports and other facilities for young people that will take them away from crime. I am an admirer of the Minister and the manner in which he sometimes stands alone in saying such things but it must be implemented. One must have jails to put people away, not for three or four months in order that they take a winter break; they must be put away for years.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Having been involved in this area and been in a pub, I have seen how young people can enjoy a few drinks. It is when drugs come into play later in the night that they cannot be handled. That is one objection I have to the new proposal for nightclubs to open for an extra hour late at night. It would be better having people go out at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. rather than having them stay out until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. and then supposedly be able to get up and work. They are not able to do so and go back to drinking, at which stage they get involved with drugs and so on.</P>
      <P>As a new Deputy, I firmly believe we do not put enough resources into supporting the young who are all good people. It is very easy to knock them since they do not come out to vote but they need help. They must be protected from the <Col N="1646"/>criminals who make massive sums from them. At Christmas or any other time garda&iacute; are on the beat, some might not like it.</P>

	<P>I am all alone on the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenches, but I will not panic. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House. I hope he will not be offended if I applaud the work he is doing in the housing area. I am always happy to support his work in that area and in his other portfolio, in which he has responsibility for the drugs strategy and community affairs.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest earlier to the fair comments of the new Fine Gael Member for Meath, Deputy McEntee, during the debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. I was glad to hear him praising the work of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, as I have done on many occasions. I compliment Deputy McEntee on his contribution. Perhaps Fine Gael is changing by giving an opportunity to people who will express honest and fair opinions.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on introducing the motion before the House. I am always happy to speak on Private Members&rsquo; business because it is important that we should discuss the issues of the day. I do not doubt that the issue of housing, for which the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is responsible, is among the issues of the day. I am happy to support the Minister of State, who has visited Tallaght and other parts of the Dublin South-West constituency on a number of occasions. I hope he will visit the constituency on many further occasions to bring much more good news to the area during the 800 days which remain before the next general election.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that Dublin South-West has a relatively young population. The constituency includes many places other than Tallaght, which is the third largest population centre in the country, such as Firhouse, Templeogue, Greenhills and Brittas. Many young people come to my constituency clinics every <Col N="1649"/>week to discuss housing issues. While some of them are seeking improved housing provision, many others speak about the issues raised in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to this motion. I refer to matters such as rent subsidy, homelessness and problems of anti-social behaviour. In the short time available, I intend to discuss some of those issues.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has my full support as he continues to develop housing programmes in co-operation with the various local authorities. South Dublin County Council has taken the Minister of State&rsquo;s advice in recent years by implementing a rolling programme that covers many years. It is using public money in a good way to develop its housing stock. Rather than sitting by the telephone as they used to do, local authority officials now know where they are going with the house-building programme. The Government should continue to support the programmes of social and, in particular, affordable housing. The Minister of State should understand how important such programmes are to young people in places like my constituency. I am sure other Deputies will refer to other areas and I have no problem in supporting them.</P>
      <P>We should redouble our efforts to tackle the problem of homelessness. I am aware that the problem is found in other jurisdictions, but it is not good enough that people are homeless in this day and age. There is no homeless unit in the Tallaght area. The Minister of State is aware that I often make the point that homelessness is something of an underground problem. One sees people sleeping rough in parks and under the canopy in the priory. It is important that we should understand the challenges we face in this regard. I am sure the Minister of State will not mind me saying that we need to support such people, not only through the housing schemes but also through the involvement of other agencies. It is important that we should do that.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about rent subsidy and other related initiatives taken by the Minister of State, such as the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the measures taken as part of the fight against anti-social behaviour. I have told the Minister at other forums that it is important that Members should support such initiatives. Deputies speak about the issues of the day in their constituencies, but I am sure, like me, they often hear people complaining about anti-social behaviour. I will not name areas because I do not want the people to think I am focussing on their localities.</P>
      <P>The problems associated with anti-social behaviour, which is found throughout the country, are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as well as the Minister of State with responsibility for housing. It is important that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, understands that he has the support of the House in continuing to deal with these problems. He has made some excellent efforts in recent years. He has reminded those who con<Col N="1650"/>tinue to engage in anti-social behaviour that it is not acceptable. Not only do we have to deal with such behaviour in local authority housing estates, but, as I have often said to the Minister, we also have to deal with it in private estates. It is right that those who are encountering problems caused by young people or other anti-social elements in their estates should have the protection of the law and all the agencies and should be entitled to redress.</P>
      <P>I do not like to make a distinction between private and local authority estates, but that distinction exists. People in such estates often say they wish regulations were in place to ensure the force of law is brought to bear on those involved in such behaviour in their estates, just as it is in local authority estates. I hope the Minister of State will continue to pay attention to these issues.</P>
      <P>There have been improvements in the rent subsidy scheme, but we face further challenges in that regard. I ask the Minister of State to continue to give such issues as much attention as possible. I am aware the matter falls within the remit of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. During a debate on housing, it is relevant to point out that State funding should not be allowed simply to be put into the black hole that is landlords&rsquo; bank accounts. We should ensure that people have proper housing. If they cannot afford to purchase private housing, which is a clear issue that we have identified, they should be given as much assistance as possible. There must be some way of ensuring that we do not merely hand out rent subsidies every single week in respect of property that does not accrue to tenants or to the State. Perhaps we should adopt a more radical approach to this aspect of the problem.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, well. He has my full support in this area of his remit and in the other work in which he is engaged. I hope he understands the issues I have raised are of concern to communities in Dublin South-West and elsewhere. I look forward to expressing my support for him at the end of this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. No Administration foresaw the boom that started in the housing and construction sectors in the early 1990s. It took some time for us to realise the effects that the success of the economy would have on the construction industry. It also took time for construction companies to meet the huge increase in the demand for residential units, such as apartments and houses. It took a few years for the sector to invest the time, energy and resources needed to deal with the increased demand. Less than 30,000 housing units were being built per year some years ago, but that number had increased to 78,000 by 2004. It seems that a similar number of units will be constructed in 2005 and there is no sign of a significant reduction by 2007-08.</P><Col N="1651"/>
      <P>A number of issues need to be addressed by some of the agencies involved in the construction industry. I refer not only to building contractors and developers, but also to local authorities, which are responsible for planning. We seem, at last, to be starting to organise planning well into the future. The Minister of State said last night that there is now enough zoned land to construct 350,000 houses over the next five years. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. Local authorities must continue to rezone and identify suitable building land.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned rented accommodation in his address last night. The Government has tried to put in place a system to control this area. It announced an initiative in July 2004 where local authorities will progressively assume responsibility for accommodating rent supplement recipients. Currently the old health boards adjudicate on applications for rent supplement. They must contact the housing section of the local authority to ensure the person applying is a genuine applicant and this is causing delays. It is only right that the Government gives this portfolio to the housing section of the local authority.</P>
      <P>The local authorities will administer the rented accommodation scheme, will provide an additional source of good quality rented accommodation for eligible people and offer developers the chance to provide that quality accommodation by becoming involved with joint ventures. The local authority housing sections will have a major input into where the schemes will be provided. This use of public private partnerships is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Government has set a target of September 2008 to complete implementation of the new arrangements in all local authorities and such a time scale is workable. Local authorities will take on their new responsibilities in batches over the next two years with the transfer of rent supplement recipients with long-term housing needs to be completed by the end of this four year period. This year the Government has provided &euro;19 million to support the cost of the new structure and this will be increased incrementally as we move forward. This funding is in addition to the money provided under the local authority social housing programme and was redirected from the Department of Social and Family Affairs supplementary welfare allowance scheme. It transfers the funding from one Department to another.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister of State should look at Traveller accommodation, where much good work has been done. Significant resources are being put into the provision of state-of-the-art, hard site accommodation to cater for Traveller families who do not wish to be included on the housing lists or in housing schemes in particular urban areas. In Carlow, the local authority has successfully regenerated an area that had been used by Traveller families but had fallen into disuse and <Col N="1652"/>disrepair. The council has now put eight units in place and provided a caretaker. It is a credit to the local authority, the caretaker and the families who are taking pride in the fact that they have good houses that are well heated and they look after them. The provision of a caretaker was a very good move.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State and wish him continued success. With the provision of ongoing resources by the Government, we will continue to see progress made in the area.</P>

	<P>Housing is a topic worthy of debate and I thank Fine Gael for tabling the motion, although I do not support the sentiments in it.</P>
      <P>The country has seen radical change in recent years. When I left school, many students in my year had to emigrate but that is no longer the case. People are staying and we are experiencing inward migration. Our population is rising. Family units are changing significantly and those issues are changing the demand for housing whether we like it or not.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion refers to the abolition of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant, the increase in VAT rates on houses and the imposition of development levies. It implies that if the Government had not done these things, houses would not be so expensive. That is a load of rubbish. House prices have nothing to do with the cost of the provision of housing, they are a question of supply and demand. That is why gazumping is so relevant. It is as a result of what the Government is trying to do that demand is so high that our output is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I may not get an opportunity to do so. If the Members opposite wait, I will get to it in a moment. There was also reference in the motion to the number of affordable houses delivered to date. We should be honest about this issue. Had the Members opposite wanted a proper debate, that was not the way to put forward the motion. When Part V of the Planning and Development Act came into force, everybody knew there was a lead-in time. Planning permissions first had to be granted under the system and then the projects physically delivered.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago representatives from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts and gave their projections, and there is significant growth in those figures. It is easy to be critical and say the Government has not delivered but it is delivering. It is easy to get political mileage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not eight years since the Planning and Development Act. The number of houses that will be delivered this year under Part V will be significantly more than last year. The projections from South Dublin County Council are that 400 or 500 houses will be built under Part V this year alone. We are making progress&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some people might not describe it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but the motion does not recognise that. I agree with one aspect of the motion but Fine Gael was not the first party to raise it. It is not the first time it has been debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is right about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever the Deputy says, it will be the only aspect about which he will be right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>If I am right about it, I will thank Fine Gael for supporting an issue I first raised in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Tell us about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It concerns the fact that the affordable housing scheme is becoming more popular but one of the problems in delivering the scheme is that many of the people who qualify to participate are experiencing difficulties coming up with the deposits. The State should examine the possibility of establishing a savings scheme for first-time buyers or specifically for those who might <Col N="1655"/>qualify for affordable housing. It is an issue raised in my constituency office and we should examine it because many people who work and pay rent in one fashion or another find it difficult to come up with deposits. While an SSIA-type deposit savings scheme is part of the motion, it is something we should consider. I point out to the Members opposite that this is an issue I raised in the House on more than one occasion and it was certainly raised at a parliamentary party meeting. There is merit in the idea and it is the type of issue I would like discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies opposite want real debate on the issue but the points they have made in the motion are disingenuous in terms of the progress that has been made. I will engage with the Deputies in debate but I do not support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is talking through his hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The progress made is not being recognised. Regarding first-time buyers, we must address the issue of a savings scheme in respect of deposits. There is merit in that idea. That aspect of the motion, which has been raised in the House previously, will be raised again and is an issue that will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Fine Gael on tabling this motion. Owning one&rsquo;s own home is most important to every family and individual. Recently, RTE held an on-line poll about the cost of housing. In the comment section one person contributed the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">I&rsquo;m 23 years of age. I make &euro;27,000 a year and I&rsquo;ve done so for the last two years. I&rsquo;m single. I don&rsquo;t have rich parents to back me up. The mortgage adviser asked me to call back in two or three years&rsquo; time. He might have better news by then.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That young man was from Leitrim. That encapsulates some of the difficulties facing us and we should listen to what a young person is experiencing.</P>
      <P>The public will be interested to know what the Government has done in this area and I will use the time available to me to set the record straight. It is important that the public recognises that the Government is doing a great deal in this area. We had stated that if we were elected, we would <Col N="1656"/>provide good quality, affordable housing through a comprehensive policy to meet the growing housing demands over the period 2002 to 2007. What does that mean? We know the problem. The average house price is now &euro;255,000, and increased by &euro;18,000 in one year. The average house price was &euro;75,000 in 1996.</P>
      <P>The effect the housing issue is having on young people is serious. We know from the last census that 42,500 people over 30 live with their parents. I am sure that is not a situation that either the parents or the 30 year olds find the most desirable. We aim to ensure that supply is responsive to the level of demand. We know the demand for housing has spiralled and we must encourage more construction.</P>
      <P>The public does not want to hear that the problem is created by our own success. It wants to know what we have done to meet this demand. In 1997, the number of houses built was 38,000. In 2000, it was 50,000. Last year, it was 77,000 and consultants have predicted a similar total in 2005. Those are record construction numbers. That refutes the notion that we are doing nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the housing waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding our primary objective to ensure that supply is being responded to, it is clear our policies are working. As a result of the work we are doing, house prices have moderated somewhat but not enough and the problems remain.</P>
      <P>I would like to dwell on two areas of concern. The first is the problem of investment properties. Our policies have delivered homes but the increased number of houses are meant to help people like the young man in Leitrim on &euro;27,000 a year. I am concerned about a recent ESRI study which estimated that 12% of the 77,000 dwellings built in 2004 are either holiday homes or are empty. That must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The second issue I would like to dwell on is the State provision of affordable housing. It is obvious that increased supply will temper the price rises and help certain sections of society but they will not help everybody. There are those whose annual income is nowhere near the &euro;27,000 per annum of the individual I spoke of earlier.</P>
      <P>We spent &euro;144 million on affordable housing in 2000. We spent &euro;266 million last year and while we must continue with our policies to increase housing output, we must also increase the amount the State spends on providing housing. The level of social housing being provided is the highest ever in our generation but it must be kept going at that level. It is envisaged that 12,000 more affordable homes will be completed by 2007, and they must be completed.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to a topic raised when discussing affordable housing for young people, the so-called first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant. That is a <Col N="1657"/>misleading title. When I was a first-time buyer, I did not qualify for the grant as the house I purchased was not new. The notion that the grant was what it said on the tin is ridiculous. Another myth which needs to be dispelled is the one which contends that we have presided idly over the economy while allowing the housing problem get out of control. Almost 30% of all homes in Ireland have been built since 1997. A clear strategy has been devised to tackle homelessness. As long as there is one homeless person, there will be one too many.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gregory, Finian McGrath, Cowley, Catherine Murphy, Healy and Cuffe.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will restrict my comments to the issues of social and affordable housing and Government inaction on house prices. I will be restricted further in addressing them as it would take all week to discuss them fully. The Government&rsquo;s strategy to tackle the housing crisis which has affected the State for the best part of the last decade is based on the <i>laissez-faire</i> theory that the market will eventually solve all problems. On the basis of that theory, house prices have been allowed to spiral beyond the reach of many ordinary working people in the State. A substantial percentage of the population falls below the affordability thresholds and is not, therefore, in a position to purchase homes. According to the NESC report, up to one third of all new households, or almost 14,000 annually, formed in the period 2001 to 2006 fall far below the affordability threshold. The figure was as high as 42% in some urban areas. These circumstances have developed despite Government denials about the existence and extent of the affordability crisis. The supply of social and affordable housing is not adequate to meet the needs of these people.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is fond of regaling the House with tales of the number of houses being constructed in the State. Tonight, we have heard Government backbenchers utter the same nonsense. The Minister of State, however, is unable to tell the House the precise percentage of houses being built as second homes. Perhaps he does not want to admit that of the number of houses built each year, the percentage which are second homes outstrips <Col N="1658"/>those which constitute social housing by a factor of three to one. Is it right that there is no tax on second homes, the proliferation of which exacerbates affordability problems, especially for people in parts of rural Ireland, including the western seaboard and the south east? Is it right that some people can have two houses without an additional tax liability while others have none?</P>
      <P>It is wrong that Government policy does nothing to counteract these developments. Is there not something fundamentally wrong when State policies do nothing to disincentivise the ownership of multiple dwellings while some remain homeless? The activity is incentivised by a significant number of tax reliefs, including mortgage interest tax relief for landlords and the so-called targeted supply subsidies such as sections 23 and 50 tax relief. Will the Government act on the recommendations contained in the NESC report on housing and introduce a tax on second homes? The NESC is not some radical, left wing group, but a Government agency.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s stock response to the house price crisis is that with the current high level of output, balance between supply and demand will be achieved allowing prices to stabilise and affordability problems to be resolved. The Government&rsquo;s view is contradicted by the NESC report which states that the number of people eager to purchase a home but unable to do so under market conditions is unlikely to get smaller. According to the report, any improvement in affordability due to further restrictions in the rate of increase in house prices and the catch-up of earnings relative to them is likely to be more than offset by interest rate rises.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister of State to bring proposals before the House to meet the housing needs of those on local authority waiting lists who vainly hope to secure one of the few units of social or affordable housing being constructed for those priced out of the housing market. If he has no solution to offer, he should have the dignity to resign.</P>

      <P>I support the motion as it serves to focus our attention on the vital issue of the basic right of all our people to decent living accommodation which successive Governments have failed to honour. The Government has refused to take radical action to address this fundamental right. Most Members will agree that the breathtaking cost of houses and the massive price increases which have spiralled out of control in recent years are completely unjustifiable and demand action. The scandal of homelessness is a black mark on the <Col N="1659"/>record of the State as are lengthy waiting lists for local authority housing. Profiteers lurk in the background to racketeer in new house prices and land values while a small number of multi-millionaires control the bulk of development land in the Dublin region.</P>
      <P>Such circumstances are unsustainable and unjustifiable and no amount of tinkering with the system can change them. While developers and builders manipulate and control the housing market in a manner which allows them to maximise their vast profits, the number of unfortunate people joining the local authority housing waiting lists steadily increases. The average price of a house in Dublin is well in excess of &euro;300,000 while the latest phenomenon is the increasing number of new housing schemes advertised in property supplements which feature prices starting far above &euro;1 million. While the same property supplements advise investors on the merits of properties in New Zealand, South Africa and Florida, increasing numbers of Irish people see the opportunity to obtain a home move increasingly beyond their reach. The political philosophy of the Progressive Democrats-Fianna F&aacute;il Government which produces this inequality is the most corrupting influence in Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to address the housing crisis in the State to which the Government must wake up. After eight years in power, people like the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, should step aside and let someone who has the ability and is up to it get on with the job. His record speaks for itself and the public should be reminded of it and his failure to take action. The average house price in Ireland stands at &euro;255,776 which represents an increase of &euro;18,000 in one year. The price of the average house has increased from &euro;75,000 in 1996 while, according to the 2002 census, 42,000 people aged over 30 live with their parents. Only 315 affordable housing units have been acquired under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 despite the scandal of a 100,000 person local authority waiting list. There are 5,580 homeless people in 3,773 households. These are the issues to be addressed.</P>
      <P>We require a change of attitude and policy from the Government. I urge it to implement a package of proposals to help first-time buyers. I urge it to arrange a D&aacute;il debate on changes to the rent supplement scheme and to meet its NDP targets and election promises on social and affordable housing. These are sensible proposals on which it would be better for the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to spend his time rather than on plotting and issuing sleazy leaflets about me in Dublin North-Central. If the Minister of State spent more time concentrating on his housing brief, it would be better for the people who want to get a house.</P><Col N="1660"/>
      <P>I urge all Members to take housing very seriously and to propose fresh ideas like those I have mentioned which put the issue at the top of the political agenda. I call on the Government to advance the Sustaining Progress initiative on housing and accommodation which has the potential to deliver more than 10,000 affordable housing units. Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 must be implemented. These are sensible proposals to assist people with serious housing needs. I urge all Members to reflect on the housing crisis in our wealthy country. I will support the motion when the House divides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>While house prices continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate, the demand for social housing is now at its highest level since the formation of the State. The last official record on waiting list figures shows that over 48,000 households are waiting for social housing but this figure is likely to grow after the recent assessment which took place in March.</P>
      <P>There is a reluctance to deal with the lack of social housing. The composition of waiting lists may be changing as more smaller households and single people are replacing families on local authority waiting lists. This is a reflection of demographic changes in society. However, just because there are more smaller and single person households should not lessen the housing need of those on the waiting list. Single people also need housing.</P>
      <P>The Government constantly argues that social housing output has risen since 2000 but this rise is very small when compared to the increase in private house building for owners and investors. The Government continually praises itself for the continued high levels of private house building as if it had produced this housing itself. The high level of private house building has been achieved by private developers, land speculators and banks, often on the backs of the significant and growing number of new young households that need housing. These are the facts. Although an increased supply in the number of houses being built has reduced the increase in house prices, the reality is that the entry point to become a new home owner is now up to ten times the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>Something can be done to address this. Last year the Government commissioned the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution examine property rights. Recently the National Economic and Social Council produced a report which had a series of practical recommendations on social and affordable housing, including recommendations to provide 73,000 new social rented homes up to 2012. There is no urgency in regard to recommendations in these reports. The NESC, which represents the social partners, produced a report but to date this con<Col N="1661"/>sensus approach has not been reflected by the Government in concrete action.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to have a debate in the D&aacute;il on this matter and to tell the public what the Government intends to do to help low income groups access housing. Let us see if the Government will actively intervene and provide more resources to local authorities and housing associations to build more social housing like NESC and the social partners agreed, or if it sit on its hands and rely on profit-driven private landlords to fill the gap with the tab being picked up by the State in a significant bill for private rent subsidies which is heading for &euro;350 million this year. This is a case of an open cheque book for private landlords on the back of the poor and vulnerable. The Minister will be aware that more and more small families have to rely on private landlords to be housed. This is not a satisfactory response from the Government and I ask that it be examined urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the limited time available I wish to focus on three aspects of the motion, namely, Part V, rent assistance and local authority loans.</P>
      <P>Over 3,000 individuals or families are seeking to be housed on the local authority waiting lists in County Kildare. That is in the region of 10,000 people, which is equivalent to a medium sized town. Given the extent of the development that has been occurring in Kildare I was prepared to accept when it was introduced in the first place that Part V might be a reasonable response. It is more than three years since the scheme was introduced and to date it has delivered no more than a couple of dozen apartments and houses. I accepted that a lead-in time would apply, but that is just totally off the wall.</P>
      <P>Given that Part V has replaced direct-build as the central response to the housing list, it cannot be allowed to drift in this manner. Local authorities have had a very patchy record and all the Department appears to be interested in doing is complaining about how patchy that record is instead of investigating the reasons for it and addressing them. The stupidity of this approach means that significant amounts of rent assistance is paid to landlords for the additional years that people are lingering on housing waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Rent supplement and how it is handled is the greatest poverty trap I have encountered. If one works, one does not qualify for rent assistance. One does not have a choice but to stay at home and in many cases postpone one&rsquo;s working life. I know numerous people who have resorted to tranquillisers because of this, which results in them just drifting along. In most cases taking a job is not an option, especially when one looks at the cost of rent and child care. There must be a change in this approach.</P>
      <P>Five years appears to be a typical period for a person to be required to spend on the waiting list. <Col N="1662"/>Not only are we making people postpone their working lives, we are ensuring that they live in poverty. The vast majority of people on waiting lists have children. We are also losing out on their skills and the contribution they could make to the economy and in terms of personal development. The current approach does not make social or economic sense.</P>
      <P>For those lucky enough to be allocated an affordable house the limit for annuity loans from local authorities is ridiculously low at &euro;165,000. It is impossible for people to make the breakthrough. Where I live affordable houses cost around &euro;200,000, if they are available at all. This problem exists in every county. In excess of 100,000 individuals are on the waiting list. That is the equivalent of the population of three counties, Carlow, Leitrim and Longford. If that is not a problem I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>The most important thing the Government could do in response to this motion is to accept that a housing crisis exists. The housing crisis is a damning indictment of the abject failure of the Government to deal with the housing situation. It is a crisis when 70,000 families are on local authority housing waiting lists. It is a crisis when one has, as is the case in south Tipperary, a 40% increase in the number of families on local authority waiting lists since the Government came to power in 1997. It is a crisis when the average house price has risen from &euro;75,000 in 1997 to &euro;255,000 this year. It is about time the Government and the Minister dealt with it as such. I call on the Government and the Minister to grasp the nettle, accept we have a housing crisis and do something about it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise another housing issue that has not been addressed amidst all the hullabaloo in the past ten days about rural planning guidelines, that is the problem of affordability and housing in urban areas. Unless one is lucky enough to own a site or for one&rsquo;s family to own a patch of land it is very difficult for those living in villages, towns and cities to provide housing for themselves and their families.</P>
      <P>There is a real blind spot in Government policy in terms of the lack of recognition of the problems of housing in urban areas. For every site and every house that is built in the open countryside there is a significant level of frustration building up among people who want to house themselves and their families in urban areas. The Government could be doing more. It could provide sites and well managed plots of land close to the heart of our villages, on under-used land in our cities, or on surplus institutional land in towns.</P>
      <P>There is a significant amount of land, not out in the open countryside but close to schools, pubs, shops and to the heart of our communities that could have well designed schemes built on it. I <Col N="1663"/>appeal to the Government to spend more time looking at what can be achieved close to the heart of where communities want to be. I urge the Government to look again at Part V and to put back in the provisions that were filleted out of the 2000 Act in late 2002. The provisions taken out would have provided enough funding to give people roofs over their heads. There is now only a smattering of housing coming up under Part V. As a previous speaker pointed out, the argument that it takes time is good enough for one or two years but not three years on and seven years after the Government came to office.</P>
      <P>The Government must do more with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act. It must provide a spectrum of housing options for people and allow for flats to be sold. People are living in local authority accommodation whose parents and grandparents grew up in the flats in which they live. These people do not have a chance to buy them outright. It makes them uneasy and unhappy that they are looking at new apartments being built to the left and right of them while they know they have no chance of buying the roof over their head. People should be given that right, whether it be in Mounttown, Ringsend or the north inner city. Those people wish to be the heart of their communities and the Minister is not doing enough to allow them to buy their flats. I look forward to provisions being put in place to allow people to buy their homes.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also do more in regard to quality. I foresee that in a couple of years the European Union will again take a case against Ireland because the Minister is dragging his heals on the building performance directive. Why does he not introduce it from 1 January next year? Why does he not give all new homes as well as those that come on the market an energy rating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy get the agreement of Members behind him for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Fridges have an energy label on them. The Minister of State should provide the same for housing. Why not provide grants for greenhousing solutions? Why not provide and foster the innovation that people want to provide? Instead we get a dumbing mediocrity when it comes to the Government&rsquo;s housing policy. While the Minister of State often boasts about the record number of completions, 70,000, 80,000 or maybe 90,000 next year, the proportion of local authority and affordable homes is at a record low and he must do something about this. He owes it to people who have been on housing waiting lists for many years.</P>
      <P>I have one last plea. The Minister of State should put in place a joint housing list for all the Dublin local authorities. A bureaucracy exists that can be very difficult for people to overcome. They deserve the right to be considered for hous<Col N="1664"/>ing anywhere in the greater Dublin area. I would like the Minister of State to put that in place without delay.</P>

	<P>Deputy Fiona O&rsquo;Malley, before she left the Chamber, urged the House to consider the dilemma facing young couples. This is a problem she should face too because her party is in Government. It should certainly realise the dilemma facing young couples. The reality of this was brought home to me when a young couple with three children came into my office recently. They have been seven years on the local authority waiting list in Galway city and are still unable to get a house. They pay &euro;200 a week for modest rented accommodation and because the husband works, they do not qualify for rent supplement. Despite this, the local authority is still unable to house people who find themselves in that dilemma. The housing officer said that there were people with four children and more who were on the waiting list longer and would have to be housed before them.</P>
      <P>On researching the situation, I found that more than 100,000 people are on local authority waiting lists. The Government does little to alleviate the situation and, if anything, its policies make matters much worse. It has abolished the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant, increased VAT by 1% on housing building materials and imposed development charges, which alone added &euro;15,000 to the price of a house. The average price of a house in Ireland is now &euro;255,776, an increase of around &euro;18,000 in one year. The Government bears the main responsibility for this. Since this Government came to office, the average house price has increased by approximately &euro;160,000. It has more than doubled in the lifetime of the current Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition. Some 5,500 people in Ireland are homeless.</P>
      <P>In the recent budget an attempt was made to alter stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it was not enough to take them out of the tax net. Fine Gael, in the next Government, will abolish stamp duty on second-hand houses up to a value of &euro;400,000. The Government has taxed housing out of the reach of first-time buyers and young couples. Between development levies and taxes, a major proportion of the price paid for a house is directly taken by the Government. The Construction Industry Federation has published figures which show that the Government takes more than &euro;100,000 out of the housebuyer&rsquo;s pocket with every house purchased.</P>
      <P>This week in the D&aacute;il, the Government voted to pass the Second Stage of the Disability Bill <Col N="1665"/>2004 against the express wishes of all groups representing people with disabilities as well as the wishes of Fine Gael and other Members of the Opposition. In a typical arrogant manner it ignored the strong lobby against this Bill in its present form. A similar Bill was withdrawn under pressure before the previous general election on the promise that it would deliver rights-based legislation. The Government has once again deceived and let down people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the attitude of councils towards applications for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant and others and the red tape and delays involved. Some 90% grant aid is available for the disabled person&rsquo;s grant, but only 60% of that is refundable from the Government. In many cases that I have witnessed, because of the red tape, an invalid person who required a downstairs bedroom or bathroom and shower in a two-storey house died before the work was completed. That is scandalous and the Government has allowed it to continue.</P>
      <P>This week the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, relaxed, as he termed it, the regulations for one-off housing in rural areas. This is a sham. The senior planning officer in County Galway told me it would make not one iota of difference.</P>

      <P>A fully integrated policy should be adopted to tackle homelessness. This should include measures to prevent people from becoming homeless as well as provisions for those already without a home. Fine Gael opposes the Government&rsquo;s six month rule on rent supplements and all other welfare cuts that tend to drive more people further into poverty and homelessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion tabled by my colleagues. I will confine myself to one problem which is relevant to my constituency and <Col N="1666"/>which I imagine is also increasingly relevant in other urban constituencies, namely, the ownership and management of property by companies, whether for gated communities, apartments, small housing developments or duplexes. This is an area of uncharted waters in Ireland. Problems are emerging already from the number of contacts I have had on this issue in my constituency. It is a matter that should be dealt with now before it reaches crisis proportions.</P>
      <P>It is mainly about ensuring that management charges are paid and kept for the purpose for which they were intended. A major change has occurred in the scale of apartment ownership. It is not an entirely new phenomenon. We have had apartments in the past, but they were owned primarily by landlords who had an income against which to offset management charges. The situation is now quite different in that a much broader spectrum of the population, including many first-time buyers and young families, are moving into these apartment blocks. There is a need for standardisation of leases so they can know what they are getting into. Something similar to the residential tenancy board contracts that are produced for landlords and tenants should be available for apartment block owners. They should have some idea not alone of their own but of their joint responsibilities. That is where the concept falls down and there is an enormous information deficit.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Maintenance charges now resemble the old rates bills and are regarded with the same dread, taking a large chunk of a homeowner&rsquo;s money. The lack of understanding of what they are for only adds to the tension associated with them. Maintenance charges for starter apartments can be as high as &euro;2,000 a year, placing enormous pressures on young home owners. House buyers are being duped by elaborate designs, such as fountains and wooden cladding, that look lovely and sell the apartments quickly but are high maintenance features. It is never properly explained to the owners that they are responsible for maintaining them. A property&rsquo;s value can rapidly fall as the owners cannot meet the maintenance costs associated with these features.</P>
      <P>When owners cannot pay the maintenance charges, the exterior of the building falls into disrepair, making them unpleasant places in which to live and difficult to sell. However, there are other pitfalls such as those associated with insurance responsibilities held for common areas. Many owners do not realise that if their building is not properly insured, the mortgage holders can foreclose on the mortgage. If uninsured premises go on fire, those who withheld their management charges are responsible not only for their own building but the apartments of others and can be sued by other owners. There is also the added problem of public liability. Those who cannot meet their management costs increase the burden on others. The sinking fund, a precautionary fund <Col N="1667"/>primarily for dealing with major structural repairs, is dipped into as the burden becomes too great. If that is frittered away on day-to-day maintenance there will be endless problems for those affected apartment blocks in the future.</P>
      <P>Problems associated with property management companies are beginning to arise. Many disputes are due to misunderstandings as to what property management companies are about. They are working on behalf of those who own the apartments. Matters can be simplified for apartment owners. I accept the potential exists for homeowners to be the managers of their buildings. However, the exigencies of company law make this difficult for small complexes and can put unnecessary responsibilities on them.</P>
      <P>New legislation is required to ensure the sinking funds for long-term structural repairs are protected. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must promote standard leases and give the maximum protection and certainty to buyers. Almost all homes being built in south Dublin are apartments; 1,600 received planning permission last year alone. Nationwide, apartments make up one fifth of all house units built. Apartment blocks can provide a pleasant living environment with a good social mix, but only if the standard of the property is maintained. This can only be ensured if there is regulatory and legislative change and before crises emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was saddened to hear from the Government benches long apologies and insinuations that the Opposition does not understand the housing problem. It is the Government that has not understood this problem. The saddest part of this is when we are told record numbers of houses are being built when they are being bought by financial institutions, investors and others who rent them back to the unfortunate people who are ultimately paid by the supplementary welfare system. To heat more coals on the heads of those in need of a home, the Government last year decided to curtail those welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Since the Government came into office, house prices have risen. There has been much waffle and hot air from the Government about building new houses. However, there has been no action. Some Government Members explain this away by claiming there are different problems, such as a growing population. We always had a growing population. In the mid-1980s when there was allegedly no money in the State and those on the other side of the House claimed they had the answer for everything, my local authority, in one year, provided 600 houses for people on waiting lists. This was a time when the list comprised 1,000 people. Now there are more than 3,500 families on the housing list but only a dribble of social housing being provided.</P>
      <P>Recently, I tabled a parliamentary question on the landbanks available to the local authorities <Col N="1668"/>for social and affordable housing. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government replied that the information was not available. That is gross negligence on the Government&rsquo;s part. There was never an intention to resolve the housing problem. It has been raised in the House for the past seven years, yet not one attempt has been made to resolve it. However, now coming near the general election, the Government will put its hands together to pretend to the public it is addressing it. &ldquo;Too late&rdquo; is the answer.</P>

	<P>Deputy McCormack spoke about the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. I am aware of applications for that grant in County Wexford that are three to four years old. One dates from a month or two before the general election in 2002. The elderly couple concerned are in failing health. By the time they get the disabled person&rsquo;s grant it will be no good because they will have gone to their eternal reward. That is the sad reality of what is happening to the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme not only in Wexford but throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government to meet its national development plan targets and election promises on social and affordable housing and to convene a crisis meeting with the social partners to address the issue. I ask the Government to support the motion but its Members will vote against it tonight. They will not agree with the motion here but when they return to their constituencies they will agree with it.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, confirmed last night that there is a remarkable record of achievement by this Government with regard to housing. He clearly demonstrated that housing is a priority for the Government. There is a clear and comprehensive housing strategy which is designed to increase supply. We are increasing supply.</P>
      <P>We are also increasing access to housing for lower income groups and improving the housing conditions of local authority tenants, the elderly, the homeless and people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Who wrote that speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will outline the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should sue the person who gave him that script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government accepts that housing supply is the key to keeping house prices down. It is working to that end by investing in infrastructure, using land effectively through <Col N="1670"/>higher residential densities and streamlining the planning mechanisms. It is no surprise, therefore, that there was no acknowledgement by the Opposition during this debate of the considerable strides made in the housing sector in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no surprises to pull out of the hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Measures were introduced to boost overall housing output. There were almost 77,000 completions in 2004 compared with a mere 22,000 ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who bought them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The year 2004 was the tenth year to show a massive increase in housing output. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 marked an important step in developing and modernising the private rented sector. Substantial resources have also been invested in social and affordable housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has brainwashed the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are conscious of the problems of affordability faced by people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Just about conscious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and we will continue to work to ensure house prices come down and more land is made available. That is happening as we speak. The Department is not idle. It is currently examining the NESC and other recent reports. It is paying considerable attention to the proceedings of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution on private property, which has a bearing on the housing sector. It is considering new measures that will be desirable both in the short and medium terms. These will shortly come before the Government.</P>
      <P>Much was made last night of the level of outputs being achieved under social and affordable housing programmes. We are currently delivering numbers of social and affordable housing that have not been seen in a generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true; it is rubbish. The Minister should sue the guy who wrote that script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a total housing provision of &euro;2 billion and this will enable the housing needs of in excess of 13,000 households to be met through the various social and affordable housing measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Further advances in meeting long-term housing needs are expected this year from the new rental accommodation scheme. <Col N="1671"/>Contrary to what has been said by some Deputies&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the homeless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it should be clarified that social housing output is not delivered solely by local authorities. We have moved on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What about homeless people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We have developed and expanded the voluntary and co-operative housing sector in recent years to a point where over 1,600 units of accommodation were provided last year for people in need. It is a record for the sector and is almost three times the output levels achieved by the rainbow Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has an appalling record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is fully committed to continuing the supports for this sector. It is making a substantial contribution to overall housing output.</P>
      <P>The Opposition went to great lengths in its attempts to pour cold water on the likely impact of the rural housing guidelines which were launched last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is another whitewash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines are explicit in a way that they never were previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give way for a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>They are a massive step forward in defining what are reasonable proposals and suitable sites. They go significantly further than both the 1997 sustainable development strategy and the national spatial strategy in providing the policy framework for local authorities to plan effectively for their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Browne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>My advice to Opposition Members is that they tell their councillors that the development plans and local area plans are being implemented and urge them to ensure that their local authorities will put the guidelines in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should say that to his party Members, including Deputy Browne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition also took issue with the long-standing system of development contributions. The Fine Gael Party was at <Col N="1672"/>one with the Government with regard to the Planning and Development Act and the transparency and accountability it would yield. Suddenly, Fine Gael is questioning the contributions. These contributions will ensure the provision of playgrounds, community facilities and the other facilities that are crucial for a community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must give way. I am obliged to call Deputy Perry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again, as they did before the last election, Fine Gael Members are defining Fine Gael policy on the hoof, which cannot be delivered in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Ring and O&rsquo;Dowd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of housing, the Government has failed on all accounts. This includes not only the astronomical cost of buying a house but also homelessness, the supply of social housing and planning. The State gets &euro;50,000 from every new house that is built. The greatest profit margin is secured not by the developer but by the Government. A couple buying a new house is, in effect, giving the State &euro;50,000 while the first time buyer&rsquo;s grant has been abolished.</P>
      <P>I recently raised with the Government the badly needed 500 new local authority houses in County Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not mention the exemption in the budget or the tax relief in the previous budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Sligo has a young population and it needs to encourage people to live in the region. Thankfully, people are willing to live there but there is no social housing available for them. Those who can afford to buy houses find themselves crippled with enormous debt and unable to cope with the burden of indirect taxation which this Government has imposed.</P>
      <P>The Government is responsible for not controlling house prices which, in some regions, are increasing at a rate of &euro;20,000 per year. Its mismanagement has resulted in a major crisis. In 1996, when Fine Gael was in Government, the average price of a house was £75,000 nationally and £88,000 in Dublin. House prices are expected to rise annually&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>At that time the economy was on the floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but they are now rising at an astonishing rate.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1673"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>We know who brought it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This year a house in Dublin will cost &euro;340,000 while in other parts of the country it will cost &euro;220,000. That is a rise of &euro;20,000 per year, which is unbelievable. Twenty years ago people had to leave this country because they could not find work. Thank God, that is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Good management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>However, this Government has overseen a position where people simply cannot afford to buy a house. Young people have no option but to live at home until they are in their 30s and earning a wage which will allow them to buy a house. Otherwise, they must throw money down the drain on rented accommodation.</P>
      <P>The changes which have been implemented have been too few and too late. The &euro;317,000 stamp duty threshold is lower than the average price of a house for a first time buyer in Dublin. What was the Minister, Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s, intention when he introduced this change? While a change in the threshold is welcome, a change which would affect people in a more helpful way would have been more welcome.</P>
      <P>Only 187 affordable housing units were completed last year. Figures for this year are elusive so we can only presume there will not be a major change in that figure at the end of 2005, regardless of what the Government says. Talking will not put a roof over people&rsquo;s heads. According to the Higher Education Authority, 1,000 students are living in hostels. It is unacceptable that the Government will refer to the need for a highly educated population but will not support students by putting a roof over their heads. We have the wealthiest economy in Europe, but people are still living on the streets. A total of 1,140 children are homeless, which is horrific. The Government must stand up and be accountable for this.</P>
      <P>The national spatial strategy continues to be undermined at every level. We need to put a strategy in place that will not just make do for a few years, but will be sturdy enough to support Ireland for generations to come. With a growing population, planning is imperative yet we have a lack of planning from the Government. It should be truly ashamed of this. People have to wait on lists for affordable housing, yet they cannot avail of such housing. It is impossible for so many young people today to get on the housing ladder.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, was a mighty man when he was on the backbenches. You are now polluted with power having worked with officials in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker><Col N="1674"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is polluted by power. He is intoxicated with power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supposed to be environmentally friendly over here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is not living in the real world. Ministers have lost touch with their constituents. The minute the Minister of State got his car and was driven around, he lost control of himself. When he was over here he had all the answers, yet over there he has no answers.</P>
      <P>Fianna F&aacute;il was always the party of the builders. The builders fall over themselves to get into the camp in Galway to hand over money to the party. They are telling the party that they are giving over the money so that houses are not built. That is what they say to the young people of Ireland. The houses must not be built so that the builders can control the market and the prices and they can give Fianna F&aacute;il more money. Yesterday, I listened to a presentation by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on social housing. I was told that there were 6,000 houses built last year for social housing, when the Government promised three times that number. The Government has let down the poor and the weak.</P>
      <P>When it had an opportunity to make the builders hand the land over to the local authorities, the Government rushed legislation through the D&aacute;il on Christmas week and guillotined the Bill to make sure that the builders would be protected for the Galway races. The builders then could give more money to Fianna F&aacute;il, and that is what is going on. These are the vested interests that are dictating the construction of houses in Ireland. The Government is not doing so because it has handed over control to the builders. I worked as an auctioneer and I know that housing is all about supply and demand. If one controls the supply, there is no problem. The Government and the builders are controlling the supply. It is happening in my area. Builders from the Fianna F&aacute;il Party are buying the first, second and third field so that they can control the housing market for the next 30 years. They will dictate how many houses are built every year and at what price.</P>
      <P>The Government parties are the greatest robbers of all. Young people trying to start out are paying big money for sites and to builders. Then they have to pay crippling taxes to the Government. That is a disgrace. If the Government parties were serious about housing, they would give young people the opportunity and would not charge them any tax. They would give them a tax rebate if they were serious about the housing market, but they are not. They are serious only about the builders who have controlled the market for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy ever stop on occasion and look at the facts?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1675"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State had all the answers when he was on the backbenches, but he is now polluted by power. It has gone to his head and he is now talking like Ministers who have been there for ten years. I thought that would never happen to the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. He disappoints me. I know he waited a long time and he wants to hold on to the job. I do not blame him for that, but he should try to do something for the young couples in this country who want a home and forget about the guys who can afford it. He should forget about the millionaires who are using this country as a holiday home. It is time the Government dealt with this problem. We are aware of the problems and the answers, and it is up to the Government to deliver the answers. It must forget about the vested interests and look after the young people who need a home.</P>
      <P>Take the example of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant. I am tired of people coming into my clinic about this. The Minister of State passed a remark to my colleague, telling him to go back to the local authority. When people could speak up in local authorities, the Government got rid of them because it knew that we knew what was going on. County managers come to Dublin every week to meet the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The managers have said that they do not want Oireachtas Members on councils because they know too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not say much for Fine Gael councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has taken out the people who knew something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reluctant to intervene, but the Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a very lively debate and I welcome the sincere contributions made. While most of them have been made by the Opposition, there has been a meeting of minds on some issues. There is a real need to debate housing and I hope that the Government provides more time to discuss this issue at a later date.</P>
      <P>If we had a proper spatial strategy, we could plan the development of our country. If the Government placed industry in the towns around Dublin and around the country, we would be able to build houses for a cheaper price in those areas. The price of housing in Dublin has now gone out of control. What is possible to do in towns in not possible to do in Dublin. A house that cost &euro;300,000 to buy on 1 January 2005 is expected to <Col N="1676"/>cost &euro;322,000 by the end of the year. That represents an increase of approximately 7%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Salaries go up as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>What about savings? How will someone get an extra &euro;22,000 on 1 December when that person cannot afford the house on 1 January? This issue is at the core of Fine Gael policy. We are asking the Government to introduce a special savings scheme, like the SSIA, which will help young people who are saving to buy a home. That is the kernel of our problem. It would cost &euro;50 million in one year. Under the scheme, first-time buyers would receive &euro;1 for every &euro;3 saved, provided those savings are used for a deposit on a house. No tax or interest would apply and the recipient must show regular monthly savings for a minimum of two years. The scheme would operate for both new and second-hand houses.</P>
      <P>Regardless of changes in the market and how our parties differ politically, young people today cannot buy a house of their own. They can least afford it in Dublin city. The Minister of State spoke last night about areas where starter homes were available for &euro;140,000. These houses are very rare indeed &mdash; one would not get a garage for that money in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There were fine homes sold for that price near Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that these houses do not exist, but the average price is double that. It would be great if they stayed at that price, but it is not controlled by the Government at this stage. It is unacceptable that the average house price in Dublin city is far beyond the means of the ordinary person. I challenge the Minister of State to introduce such a savings scheme to help young couples buy a house of their own.</P>
      <P>Another issue that has not been addressed by the Government is social and affordable housing. It is estimated that 77,000 houses will be constructed this year. According to the NESC report&rsquo;s figures, which were published today by AIB on the web, one third of purchasers of these houses will buy a house for the second time. The Minister should do a deal with the construction industry, which employs more than 250,000 people, so that it would meet the Government&rsquo;s demand for social and affordable housing. The requirement for people in this category will be between 0.5% and 1.2% of the 77,000 homes under construction this year. As demand for housing drops, the Minister should do a deal so that when houses are built, the Department will purchase them at a price that people can subsequently afford. That is what must happen. It is the only future for social and affordable housing.</P>

      <sTitle>Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems the Minister for Health is determined to avoid any direct connection with this issue, despite its importance. The last time this issue was discussed in this House was 25 June 2004. At the time, the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, assured me the then Minister, Deputy Martin, was fully aware of the difficulties with the current building in Cork and was working with the IBTS to develop a suitable alternative.</P>
        <P>The development brief for the new Cork centre project was submitted to the Department by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in March 2003. The cost of the project at that time was &euro;28 million. We can only wonder how much it would cost today. We have no notion of how much it would cost because nothing has happened. No design team has been appointed and no work has taken place on the promised new building despite the promise made by the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley that planning permission would be, in his own words, fast-tracked and that all that was to be done would be done as quickly as possible. Despite this, nothing has happened. There are three new prefabs but the service still works from the old prefabs which have been nailed up and their roofs repaired.</P>
        <P>We should remind ourselves that this is the centre that discovered a link between contaminated blood products and hepatitis C, something for which every woman should be grateful. The Cork centre is the only one, apart from a laboratory in a maternity unit in Galway general hospital, that has received a quality assured ISO mark. The IBTS headquarters in Dublin has never achieved this quality mark. The Cork centre achieved the quality mark under appalling conditions, leaking roofs, prefabs over 20 years old and no certainty about the future of the unit. Imagine what it could have done had it had ideal working conditions.</P>
        <P>This saga began with the Finlay tribunal. The main recommendation from that awful tribunal was that the blood transfusion service in Cork should be upgraded and a new building put in place. That was in 1997. In 2001, the Joint Committee on Health and Children supported the Finlay recommendation but still the IBTS dragged <Col N="1682"/>its heels and nothing was done. As a compromise, it was agreed to appoint a panel of experts agreed by the IBTS and a sub-committee of the Southern Health Board. Those international experts, recognised as experts in their field, recommended that Ireland should have a second test centre to ensure a safe, secure, speedy service.</P>
        <P>People may not be aware of this, but doctors and consultants in the south are concerned about this centre that has served the country well. Everyone from the expert panel to doctors and clients are concerned about those whose health and safety this Government is charged with protecting. The experts say that two centres is the way to go. The question remains why we are still waiting on a new building. Will we have to wait for this new building as long as we have been waiting for BreastCheck? What is happening and where is the building?</P>
        <P>Everyone agrees that the scandal that was hepatitis C and the infection of haemophiliacs through contaminated blood products should not have happened and can never be allowed to happen again. The only way to avoid it is by having two test centres, one of which happens to be located in Cork and serves the Munster region.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this matter. I make this reply on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a national organisation that plays an essential role in the health services of this State. Despite the challenges of recent years, not least the particular difficulty presented by vCJD, the service has risen to the challenge and maintained the national blood supply to hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Munster centre is an integral part of the national organisation. While there have been acknowledged difficulties with the facilities available to the Munster centre, the T&aacute;naiste is confident that the service provided to the people of the Munster region is on a par with services nationally. I assure the Deputy the T&aacute;naiste is aware of the difficulties with the current building in Cork and is working with the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to develop a suitable alternative.</P>
        <P>The development brief for the new Munster centre project was submitted to the Department by the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in March 2003. The capital cost of the project, inclusive of special testing facilities, is estimated at more than &euro;30 million. The T&aacute;naiste has asked me to assure the House that provision is included in the Department&rsquo;s capital plan for 2005 to allow the appointment of a design team and commencement of the planning process. While planning for the new centre is in progress, the IBTS board approved an interim development for the Munster centre in November 2003. The 660 sq. m. <Col N="1683"/>facilities which were completed in December 2004 were developed on the St. Finbarr&rsquo;s Hospital site at a cost of approximately &euro;3 million which was met from the resources of the IBTS. The T&aacute;naiste understands that the Irish Medicines Board, which is the competent authority for the IBTS, has recently inspected the new facilities and is satisfied that they meet the required good manufacturing practice requirements for the immediate future.</P>
        <P>While there is no argument that this development is an interim solution and that permanent new premises are required for the Munster centre, there has nonetheless been considerable additional investment at the centre over the years. A new components laboratory was provided at a cost of more than &euro;600,000, a second consultant post was approved and new posts in quality assurance and information technology were also approved in recent years. The Progesa integrated computer system went live in Cork in March 2003, before Dublin which went live in May that year. The posts of laboratory manager and quality assurance officer were filled last year on a permanent basis. The centre also took delivery last year of Galileo, a sophisticated new automated processing machine.</P>
        <P>The Munster centre also participates in and benefits from national developments. A strategic plan is being finalised which will guide the activities of the service nationally over the next few years and enable the service to meet the challenges of a changing environment and to maintain its position at the forefront of international developments in transfusion medicine.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste is being kept fully briefed about the position regarding developments at both the national centre and the Munster centre of the IBTS. She has asked me to assure the Deputy that she reiterates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the IBTS continues to have sufficient resources to maintain the highest possible standards in blood transfusion practice at all locations throughout the service.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Digital Hub" RHead="Project">
      <sTitle>Digital Hub Project.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to correct the wording of the matter I have raised. I should have said I wished to raise the abandonment of the digital hub by the developer. Unfortunately, the anchor tenant has left. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. I do so because the digital hub project was supposed to deliver heavily in the area in which it is located. The project was announced with aplomb amid great expectation and the Taoiseach took a significant interest in it. However, the project is two years behind target, like many others, and the anchor tenant has left, although a replacement is being sought. An attempt was made to use the public private partnership model for this project but it failed and agreement has not been reached <Col N="1684"/>between the public and private sectors regarding the delivery of the development.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The project is located on a nine-acre site, of which only two acres have been developed. I am concerned because we have had the debacles of electronic voting, which cost more than &euro;50 million, the Red Cow roundabout, which also cost a significant sum, and the port tunnel, which can only accommodate small trucks. I do not want a scenario to develop whereby the digital hub, another flagship project, runs into trouble because expectations are not being realised and targets are not being met. The original plan was not workable or was badly thought out, or it is not meeting expectations for one reason or another.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for coming in to reply to the debate. I ask that an urgent reassessment of the project be undertaken with a view to reassuring the local community and the tenants on site of the future of the project and ensuring all delays are short-circuited. If that is not done as a matter of urgency, the danger is public confidence in the project will erode and therein lies another potentially sad tale.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I am not aware of any search for or abandonment of a search for an anchor tenant in the digital hub. The digital hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, continues to be successful in attracting digital industry tenants and operates a number of community, educational and promotional initiatives. The agency has been successful in expanding the cluster, with almost 50 companies employing more than 400 employees in the hub.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be referring to the tendering process for a suitable developer for the digital hub&rsquo;s regeneration role. While it is unfortunate that there was not a successful outcome to the developer competition, we have an opportunity to move on and deliver the digital hub project in a way that will give the stakeholders greater control over the project than the competition allowed. The Minister is in discussions with the agency to deliver the property development project in a timely manner. When completed, the project will deliver 500,000 sq. ft. of enterprise, learning and educational, residential and retail space.</P>
        <P>While the larger hub site is being developed, the agency is space constrained, given the high number of tenants. Parts of the former Media Lab Europe building will be utilised by the hub on a temporary basis. On the issue of the closure of MLE, the basic premises underlying the Government commitment to research into the digital media sector remain. Research in the field of digital media is premised on a number of high level objectives, <i>inter alia</i>, establishing a scientific and technological leadership for Ireland, stimul<Col N="1685"/>ating increased research and development investment in Ireland, attracting high quality inward investment and human capital, supporting enterprise development in Ireland, supporting high quality human capital formation in Ireland, collaborating with Irish institutions and development agencies and providing a forum for international exchange and discussion.</P>
        <P>Consultation with regard to the establishment of a new research laboratory, the National Digital Research Centre, was recently concluded. It is proposed that the NDRC will consider some similar research to MLE but that there will be greater focus on sustainable research and more directive research in a new business model. The Minister will seek improved links to Irish universities and improved corporate governance. The NDRC will also be expected to develop more significant linkages with the digital media cluster emerging in the hub.</P>
        <P>The consultation found a high level of support for the proposal to continue public investment in the digital media sector in Ireland with the establishment of the NDRC and there is likely to be a satisfactory response to the recent competitive call for proposals. The Minister is absolutely convinced the digital hub will continue to expand and develop in the years ahead.</P>

      <sTitle>Job Creation.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It is with regret I raise this matter following the announcement of the loss of 100 jobs at Contact Partners call centre in Castlebar, County Mayo, earlier this week. Unfortunately, this comes after the announcement of job losses at Allergan a number of months ago and at Volex last year. Job creation has been a bad news story in Castlebar and County Mayo generally. The recent jobs losses have had serious social and economic consequences for the town, even though it is designated a hub town in the national spatial strategy, as are Ballina and Westport.</P>
        <P>Recently, the House debated the national development plan and, in particular, the underspend in the BMW region. I met IDA Ireland representatives subsequently to discuss job creation and what the authority was doing to attract industry into County Mayo but, disturbingly, I was informed that the greatest obstacle to attracting investors is the inadequate infrastructure and, in particular, the quality of the N5. This is sad given that during the first four years of the NDP, 2000-04, only 54% of the money allocated to national roads in the BMW region was spent compared with 121% in the south and east regions.</P>
        <P>The N5 is the main artery between Dublin and Mayo and it is severely deficient for more than 25 miles. The section between Ballaghaderreen and Strokestown is unfit and unsafe to accommodate heavy traffic and the Castlebar to Westport road, which was an NRA priority in the county more than five years ago, has slipped down the pecking order. One would question when it will <Col N="1686"/>be upgraded. These projects have major consequences for industry in County Mayo.</P>
        <P>Contact Partners has offered alternative employment to many of its young workers at its Shannon facility. While a number are single, many of them are settled with families and uprooting them to Shannon is not an option. A total of 100 employees have been severely affected by the decision to close. IDA Ireland has built a new business park in Castlebar in recognition of its designation as a hub town under the national spatial strategy but the authority is unable to attract industry to the town because of its inadequate infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I do not seek a task force or target group because in the past they have run into the ground and ended up going nowhere. I ask for a positive Government decision to invest quickly in infrastructure in the town. Once potential investors drive through the town, they are left with a negative impression. Given the competition between towns throughout the State seeking to attract industry, this is a severe handicap for Castlebar. I call on the Government to do something about it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the debate a number of weeks ago. Regarding the infrastructure operational programme, there was a &euro;716 million shortfall in spending in the BMW region over the past four years. The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, accepted that fact in the House on that occasion and the Minister for Finance accepted it on several occasions. Those figures are not disputed. Deputy Killeen also accepted in the House that night on behalf of the Government that towns in the BMW region now have a very significant claim to future investment in infrastructure, particularly in 2005 and 2006. However, only last week, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, I was very disappointed to see that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the only Minister we have in the west of Ireland, tried to put some sort of gloss on spending in the region by saying that there had been a 125% increase in money going on infrastructure since 2000.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that we accept that there is a deficit of more than &euro;700 million on infrastructure, that only goes to show that the level of investment in 2000 was so low that a 125% increase made very little difference. I ask the Minister to give those points favourable consideration, after which we might see an improvement in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn for raising this matter. I was disappointed to hear of the recent decision announced on 18 April by Contact Partners Communications Limited to close <Col N="1687"/>its Castlebar operation. That decision was undoubtedly a setback to the area.</P>
        <P>The parent company decided that keeping the Castlebar operation open is not a viable option. It has decided to close Castlebar and consolidate all business at its other Irish operation in Shannon. The company has stated that, operationally, it is not practical for it to continue to incur the additional costs of operating from two centres in Ireland when it could do so from only one.</P>
        <P>Current employment at Castlebar is 101 &mdash; there are 50 people employed in Shannon &mdash; and the company is planning final closure on 18 May next. I understand the staff is being offered the option of relocating to Shannon. The offer will include a relocation package. Finding alternative employment for the workers affected is a priority for F&Aacute;S and the State development agencies. F&Aacute;S has already been in contact with the company to offer its full range of support services. The company indicated that it would reply to F&Aacute;S at a later date.</P>
        <P>Achievement of balanced regional development is a central goal for IDA Ireland. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for achievement of that goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the linked hub of Castlebar-Ballina and in other key towns so that the needs of foreign direct investment can be met. IDA Ireland is committed to the development of Castlebar and County Mayo and is actively promoting the county for new foreign investment. Since January 2004, there have been seven first-time site visits to the county.</P>
        <P>In 2004 alone, four IDA Ireland-supported companies committed themselves to research and development projects in County Mayo, with potential spending of approximately &euro;5.5 million. That is a significant development essential for the development of high-quality employment in County Mayo. The current property investment programme represents cumulative planned spending of approximately &euro;11 million by IDA Ireland in County Mayo for the four years ending in December 2005.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focused property solutions in Castlebar and County Mayo. That is seen as an essential marketing tool in the process of attracting potential new investors to the county. IDA Ireland is developing world-class business and technology parks in Ballina and Westport, as well as Castlebar. In Castlebar, a new 16-acre, state-of-the-art business and technology park has been fully developed and is being actively promoted by IDA Ireland for new FDI projects.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies with detailed export plans that are expanding or establishing a business in Castlebar or County Mayo. Enterprise Ireland approved funding support of more than &euro;5.8 million and paid more than &euro;4.8 million to compan<Col N="1688"/>ies in the county for the years 2001 to 2004. To date in 2005, some &euro;563,000 has been approved in support to the indigenous sector. That financial support will enable the companies to fund their plans for innovation and new product development.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has also approved funding for ten community enterprise centres in County Mayo. Eight centres have now been completed, including one in Castlebar. The incubator unit at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Castlebar received a capital grant of &euro;1,280,000 in 2002 from Enterprise Ireland. A further &euro;76,000 was also approved towards the cost of a centre manager. The main objectives of those incubation centres are to support the development and expansion of campus company activity and to encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the third level sector.</P>
        <P>Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology is an important local source of highly skilled graduates for industry in Castlebar and County Mayo. The campus is currently working with local industry to develop specific courses to meet industry needs in information and communications and medical technologies.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the most recent live register analysis figures for Castlebar and County Mayo released by the Central Statistics Office. The year-on-year figures for Castlebar show a decrease of 99 people, from 964 to 865. Overall, the numbers on the live register for County Mayo stood at 5,297 in March 2005, down from 5,863 in March 2004, a decrease of almost 10% in unemployment using that indicator.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied the strategies and policies pursued by the State development agencies, including the county enterprise board, together with our ongoing commitment to regional development, will continue to bear fruit in overseas investment, business development and increased employment opportunities for both Castlebar and County Mayo. The relevant State agencies will continue to make every effort to secure alternative employment for the staff affected by the job losses at Contact Partners Communications Limited.</P>

    <Sect LHead="Airport Development" RHead="Projects">
      <sTitle>Airport Development Projects.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue. The debate is timely in view of the fact that the three airport authorities were before the Joint Committee on Transport last week to discuss progress regarding the State Airports Act 2004, the break-up of Aer Rianta and the distribution of capital costs of developments to the various airports.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that Cork Airport has been very successful to date. There has been a great increase in the throughput of passengers recently. It has now reached 2.25 million passengers per year, and projected growth puts that at 3 million. It is therefore important that we recognise that Cork Airport, first and foremost, has <Col N="1689"/>marketed itself very effectively. It is a strategic part of the region and its development regarding employment and foreign investment. When this issue was first debated, there was a strong objection from Aer Rianta to Cork Airport securing a new terminal, and many local Deputies fought with it to secure funding. The previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, strongly supported that project. The assumption was that, at the final stages, Cork Airport would get its new terminal but that the capital costs of providing it would not be passed on to it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State taking the debate, Deputy Callely, would have been very aware of that, having also been a great supporter of Cork Airport over the years. I know he will take a personal interest in this. Given that he is now in the Department of Transport, I hope he will understand the concerns and anxieties of people in Cork, particularly staff and management, who have gone to great efforts in recent years.</P>
        <P>Cork Airport has been a very profitable part of Aer Rianta. When other developments were going ahead in Aer Rianta, Cork Airport&rsquo;s finances funded some of them. With the shoe on the other foot, it is time it acknowledged that Cork Airport has not received fair investment over the year, and now that we have achieved the new terminal, we should not be burdened with an excessive debt that could kill its commercial future. When the previous Minister appointed the board members to Cork Airport Authority, I genuinely believe that they were also under the assumption that the capital costs would not be borne by the airport in the event of a break-up. I know there is company law and that the State Airport Act requires that the transfer of assets also be taken into account. However, whatever measures are in Cork Airport&rsquo;s business plans, they should be adjudicated on the original Government policy assumption that it would be free of the debt for the development of the new terminal. I highlight that because I have genuine concerns about the thrust of a recent debate at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, at which representatives of the Dublin, Shannon and Cork airport authorities were present. Some people insisted that Cork Airport should introduce business plans to fund the capital cost of the development of the terminal. That would be unfair as it would represent a reversal of previous Government policy when it was decided to sanction the development of the new terminal.</P>
        <P>Most people in Cork have a strong attachment to the airport. They realise that it has a major impact on the financial vibrancy of the Cork region. Figures are available to indicate that the airport is growing rapidly, mainly as a result of strong and aggressive marketing of the airport by its management and the commitment of its staff. The airport is used by a large swathe of the population outside Cork. Its catchment area will increase as the roads infrastructure to the north of Cork city improves. I am concerned that officials from other airports might try to saddle <Col N="1690"/>Cork Airport with as much debt as possible because they see it as a threat. As a public representative of the Cork area, I cannot accept that.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Minister of State&rsquo;s strong attachment to Cork and to the airport in particular. I am sure he will listen to the views of public representatives from Cork, the chambers of commerce of the Cork region and the members of the board of the Cork Airport Authority. There is deep concern and anxiety in Cork about this matter. If we are serious about the break-up of Aer Rianta, we need to tackle the many obstacles which exist. The Government needs to ensure that it complies with company law and that the three airports are solvent. Issues relating to the debt ratio and capital costs also need to be assessed. The commitments which were made should be honoured when business plans are submitted to the Cabinet for its approval.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my good friend, the assistant Government Whip, Deputy Kelleher, for raising this issue. I support the sentiments he expressed in respect of certain issues, such as Cork Airport&rsquo;s debt. I agree that we should not stifle or kill off the potential for growth that exists at the airport. The Deputy and some of his local colleagues are concerned about the growth of Cork city and the Cork region. I look forward to working with him to ensure that Cork develops in the way we would like.</P>
        <P>Like Deputy Kelleher, I congratulate Mr. Joe O&rsquo;Connor and the staff of Cork Airport on the work they have done to facilitate the growth and development of the airport which is one of the fastest growing regional airports in Europe. The number of passengers passing through the airport has increased threefold over the last ten years, from 800,000 passengers in 1994 to 2.25 million in 2004. The airport is served by a number of scheduled airlines, including three Irish airlines, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and Aer Arann. New routes have been added and a further significant increase in services to and from UK and European destinations is expected this year. Cork Airport was voted the best Irish airport in 2004 for the third consecutive year in a poll conducted by the air transport users committee of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland. I heartily congratulate all involved.</P>
        <P>The Cork Airport development project that is under construction will, in effect, deliver a new landside airport. It represents the first major upgrade of the airport since it was built in the 1950s. The new terminal building will accommodate a vast array of appropriate state-of-the-art facilities. It is expected that the terminal will be completed, as promised, by the end of 2005. I do not doubt that it will contribute significantly to the economic, social and cultural life of Cork. The airport&rsquo;s business park, part of which was designed by a horticulturist from Clontarf, has been developed in recent years. There are more than 20 buildings on the site which is a joint ven<Col N="1691"/>ture arrangement involving the airport and the private sector. I understand that it has been highly successful.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the outlook for Cork Airport is positive. The current objective is to continue to develop the business on a sound economic basis. The Government&rsquo;s policy is to restructure the three State airports, to give greater autonomy to Cork and Shannon airports and to promote development in each region. The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, enacted the State Airports Act 2004 to facilitate the restructuring. In accordance with the 2004 Act, the transfer of assets to one of the two new airport authorities cannot take place earlier than 30 April 2005. A phased approach thereafter will allow one of the new authorities to be vested first with the second being vested after sufficient distributable reserves have been built up within the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>The preparation of a comprehensive business plan by the Cork Airport Authority is a central element of the preparatory work being done in advance of the separation of Cork Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority. Business plans are being prepared by the Dublin and Shannon airport authorities. All three business plans will have to be assessed. It is expected that certain issues will have to be discussed between the authorities before any final decisions are made. As Deputy Kelleher said, the State Airports Act <Col N="1692"/>2004 requires that the Ministers for Transport and Finance must be satisfied about the operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork airport authorities, including business planning, before the assets of each of the airports can be vested in the authorities. Deputy Kelleher also mentioned some technical company law and accounting requirements in that context.</P>
        <P>The phased approach for the transfer of assets provided for in the State Airports Act 2004 is designed to cater for the fact that the distributable reserves available to the Dublin Airport Authority are insufficient to transfer assets to both Shannon and Cork. The timing of the transfer of assets will depend on the availability of distributable reserves in Dublin. Under one of the options for the separation of Cork Airport, the airport authority will have no bank debt at the time of the separation but it will have to enter into a finance lease with the Dublin Airport Authority in respect of a portion of its assets. Cork Airport has benefited greatly from the major investment made in the development of its facilities. The finance lease option would allow the Cork Airport Authority to take full responsibility for the management and operation of the airport at as early a stage as possible and to drive future growth using the platform provided by the new facilities. I look forward to working with Deputy Kelleher in that regard. I hope my comments have been helpful.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if he will bring forward legislation to remove the provisions which disqualify those over the age of 66 from the terms of the Redundancy Acts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Traditionally, the upper age limit for eligibility for redundancy payment was the same as the pensionable age within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts. In 1971 the upper age limit was 70, in line with the then old age pension age of 70. This was revised downwards by the Redundancy Payments Act 1979 to 66 years, which was the new pensionable age set out in the Social Welfare Act.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Review Group report of July 2002, which produced recommendations for the updating of statutory redundancy legislation, considered that increasing the upper age limit of 66 for redundancy qualification purposes would not be a priority in the short term if resources were scarce. It could be argued, therefore, that the age cap should remain unchanged to maintain consistency with the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 and the Employment Equality Act 1998.</P>
        <P>The group recognised, however, that the labour force is becoming older and that participation in the labour force by older people, if desired, should be facilitated. Accordingly, it was recommended that consideration should be given in the medium term to removing the age cap or raising the age cap in conjunction with similar changes to unfair dismissals, equality and social and family legislation, as recommended by the Equality Authority.</P>
        <P>On 18 July 2004, the upper age limit of 66 for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001 was removed by the Equality Act 2004. However, the Unfair Dismissals Acts will still not apply to dismissed employees who, at the date of dismissal, had reached the normal retirement age in that employment, that is if it is the policy in an employment to retire employees at a certain age, then the new provisions would not apply.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>There are no plans at present to remove the upper age limit in respect of statutory redundancy. However, in the light of the evolution of <Col N="1694"/>age-related legislative provisions, it will be necessary to review the age-related provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts. This will have to be done prior to making legislative proposals for submission to Government. In February 2003, the Government approved the provision of a sum of &euro;1 million from the social insurance fund towards modernising and e-enabling redundancy payments. The redundancy payments section of my Department is currently heavily involved in a project to modernise the existing system. Work on this project is progressing on target and it is expected that the e-enabled redundancy IT system will be ready for operation by the end of May 2005. It will take a number of months for both staff and members of the public to become totally familiar with the new system, and it is not envisaged that any new project, including the holding of a review of the age-related provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts, will commence in advance of such familiarisation.</P>

	<P>The Government recently considered and endorsed the report of the high level committee that was asked to look at the most appropriate implementation arrangements for the recommendations of the Enterprise Strategy Group, ESG. The Government is broadly supportive of the policy directions recommended by the group, as underlined by its intention to implement, either in full or with some modifications, most of the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations. Details of the position in relation to these recommendations are set out in the action plan which can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at<i> www.entemp.ie/enterprise/support/ esgactionplan.htm</i>.</P>
        <P>As regards recommendations which it is specifically not intended to implement, we have decided not to implement the recommendation that existing regulators for networked sectors should be replaced by a new regulatory body covering all networked sectors. In looking at international experience, the Government remains to be convinced that regulatory amalgamation on the scale proposed would be an efficient model. For example, there is a danger that a single regulator could give rise to slower decision-making and less focus on smaller sectors compared with more dominant ones. This matter is one for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P><Col N="1695"/>
        <P>The Government decided to consider further the potential for the disaggregation of State procurement contracts for telecommunication services and my colleagues, the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance will be dealing with this matter.</P>
        <P>The central theme of the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations concerns a strategic evolution to a more competitive, innovative and knowledge centred economy. To help create quality and sustainable employment we have to make sure Ireland continues to be an attractive place in which to invest and from which to undertake increasingly profitable business. Part of this process involves listening to business and responding to its needs with greater agility and flexibility as regards policy design and implementation. As a contribution to this process I may invite one or more enterprise members of the expert group to make a presentation on particular issues to the Government meeting at which I will report on policy developments in the context of the ESG&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>The ESG&rsquo;s report makes a valuable contribution to embedding strategies appropriate to the new realities and challenges facing the Irish economy. The ESG&rsquo;s policy prescriptions are particularly relevant to my Department and the enterprise support agencies that report to me. As part of the ESG&rsquo;s implementation process, I will be making twice yearly reports to Government on progress achieved in putting the Government approved ESG&rsquo;s recommendations in place.</P>

	<P>As I outlined in my answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question of 24 February, the reduction of 5,000 in staffing levels as announced by the Government in 2002 applies to all sectors of the public service. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, including F&Aacute;S, are expected to contribute to this reduction. In the case of F&Aacute;S a reduction of 150 over a number of years from a staffing level of almost 2,400 is considered appropriate and in the circumstances I do not propose to review the situation.</P>

	<P>The proposed new legislation, which was recommended by the 2004 Forf&aacute;s review, will provide for the introduction of new controls on arms brokering and on the provision of certain types of technical assistance. Existing legislation will also be updated to provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for increased penalties for non-compliance with export control legislation, for the statutory right for the inspection and audit, by officials from my Department, of companies that export military goods, and for controls on the transfer of relevant software and technology by electronic means.</P>
        <P>Work on drafting of the new legislation has commenced and it is planned to publish the Bill this year. The introduction of this new legislation will ensure that Ireland meets its EU and international obligations in full and it will equally ensure that its procedures are not overly restrictive as to make Ireland an unattractive location by international standards for mobile activity in legitimate industries.</P>

	<P>Full-time employment in Irish owned enterprises which are supported by the enterprise development agencies currently stands at 149,113; this represents a rise in employment of 5,000 over the five year period since the end of 1999. In the international context, in which we operate as an open economy, this represents a strong performance. More broadly, over the decade since 1995, there are 29,000 more employed in agency supported indigenous companies.</P><Col N="1697"/>

        <P FLI="0">The enterprise development agencies under my Department have a comprehensive range of supports to help firms become more competitive, expand in new markets and grow productivity. These are consistently assessed so that new programmes or refinements to help enterprise achieve sustainable competitive advantage and expand employment are implemented as required.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, which has the lead role in this area, offers a range of supports aimed at assisting Irish indigenous client companies to expand and compete in the international marketplace. The agency delivers a flexible set of solutions tailored to the needs of individual circumstances of Irish enterprises. The financial supports offered by Enterprise Ireland place a strong emphasis on encouraging research and development and improving the competitiveness of existing companies, supporting new company start-ups and growing exports. Similarly, Shannon Development, which has responsibility for Irish industry in the Shannon region, operates a number of programmes aimed at both established Irish industry and high potential start up companies. The main focus is on the technological and management ability of client companies, and on the ability of these companies to invest in and exploit research and development. The city and county enterprise boards, CEBs, have primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector. Over 30,000 jobs have been created in indigenous companies supported by the CEBs since their establishment in 1993.</P>
        <P>In the context of developing indigenous enterprises, the opportunities that easier access to world markets offer call for marketing support programmes to be delivered to develop the verydifferent abilities firms need to acquire in developing external markets. Many of the most dynamic Irish firms have chosen to invest overseas to be closer to their customers and have actively developed global business relationships to acquire specialist skills, access new technologies or source lower cost inputs.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the development agencies and industry to develop Irish enterprises&rsquo; capacity to succeed in a global market by being more innovative, smarter, quicker and more flexible. Our main objective is to minimise any negative impacts which our changing economy experiences, while also furthering the national enterprise development agenda, which is making significant progress in sustaining Irish economic growth through the sys<Col N="1698"/>tematic support of new and existing firms at all stages of business development.</P>

	<P>I understand that the liquidator has made considerable progress in realising the assets of the company and establishing the full extent of its liabilities. He has indicated that he hopes to complete the liquidation process later this year. At this stage, the main production sites at Arklow and Cork remain the principal assets yet to be realised. It is understood that contracts have been signed for the sale of the Arklow site and the sale is due to close in May. Discussions have also been taking place with a number of parties in relation to the Cork site. It is a matter solely for the liquidator to determine whether to accept any particular offer made.</P>
        <P>I also understand that all claims from secured and preferential creditors have been paid at this stage. Reports by the liquidator on the progress of the liquidation covering the period to 7 November 2004 indicate that the secured creditors were paid almost &euro;58 million while preferential creditors were paid nearly &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P>The statement of affairs presented to the creditors meeting in November 2002 estimated that the amount due to unsecured creditors was &euro;72.7 million. Of this, &euro;34.5 million relates to shareholders loans which the shareholders, ICI and the State have agreed, in principle, to subordinate in favour of the other unsecured creditors. While I do not have an up to date estimate of the amounts due to unsecured creditors, I am aware that significant additional liabilities to former employees in respect of contractual entitlements to redundancy terms have been recognised by the liquidator. In addition, the liquidator has accepted, in principle, that the trustees of the Richardson&rsquo;s superannuation scheme, covering the employees in Belfast, have an admissible claim on the liquidation but the quantum of that claim remains to be established. Claims have also been submitted by the trustees of the company&rsquo;s pension schemes covering employees in this jurisdiction and these are being considered at present.</P><Col N="1699"/>
        <P>The final position of unsecured creditors can only be determined by the liquidator when all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. The determination of any payments due to creditors of IFI is a matter solely for the liquidator.</P>

	<P>Exports to Hong Kong amounted to &euro;833 million in 2004, up 21% from the 2003 total of &euro;688 million. Hong Kong is an important business partner for Ireland in Asia, notably for services, and, in particular, for goods <i>en route</i> to other locations in China.</P>
        <P>There is much potential for Irish companies there. It is both a sophisticated market for a range of our exports and a good location for the establishment of regional sales, distribution or logistics centres. Accordingly, I welcome the maintenance and reinforcement of business and other contacts between representatives of both places.</P>
        <P>The Ireland-Hong Kong Business Forum is run by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. It is part of a worldwide network of such fora which is organised with the assistance of the authorities in Hong Kong. As a private sector organisation, its function is to enhance the relationship between its members and counterparts in Hong Kong.</P>
        <P>Last February, the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for Trade and Commerce, Deputy Michael Ahern, attended a function organised by the Hong Kong Business Forum to mark the Chinese new year. His attendance there, and at other such events to date, is indicative of Government support for the development of our trade and other relationships with Hong Kong.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach recently launched A Decade of the Asia Strategy 1999 to 2009. This recounts in some detail the importance the Government continues to place on the development of trade with eight specific Asian countries, including China, over the next five years. In the recent past there has been significant improvement in the level of our trade exports to Asia. The potential is great for doing even better in the coming five years. Accordingly, while continuing to assiduously attend to market opportunities and development prospects elsewhere, the Government and its agencies will be focusing in a strategic and coherent way on priority countries in Asia in the years ahead. China will be central in that respect.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 150 together.</P>
        <P>The economic partnership agreements, EPAs, are an integral part of the legally binding Cotonou agreement. They are first and foremost instruments to assist from a trade and development aspect the smooth and gradual integration of Asia, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states into the world economy. This will be done with due regard for their own political choices and their own development priorities.</P>
        <P>EPAs combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states. As trade is a Community competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of member states. The Commission provides the Council with updates on the progress of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>Recently, in the context of the further progression of EPA negotiations, Commissioner Mandleson has indicated that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review, with a new review mechanism to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations that the development dimension is put first.</P>
        <P>I have read with interest the recent position paper that sets out the UK view on how best the commitment to put development at the heart of the EPA negotiations can be best delivered. This is designed to promote an open discussion on EPA issues particularly as the substantive negotiations get under way. I agree with the basic thrust of an approach to the EPAs which ensures that the needs and concerns of developing countries are taken adequately into consideration during the substantive phase of these negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations process and will continue to do so. More recently this matter was considered at the Article 133 committee and further discussions will follow. Ireland will insist that the Commission discharges its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou agreement <Col N="1701"/>and in a manner which is sensitive to the particular concerns of ACP states.</P>
        <P>There is close co-operation between all relevant Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs, on questions relating to trade and development policy matters generally, including the EPA negotiations.</P>

	<P>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, known as the Health and Safety Authority, is the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health. Matters arising from this responsibility are, therefore, a day-to-day function of the authority.</P>
        <P>Overall trends in workplace accidents are best described by reference to the data from the occupational injury benefit claims published by Department of Social and Family Affairs, as the criteria for this benefit have remained the same over the years. Although it shows an increase in numbers of claims in recent years, this has to be read in the context of the economic expansion that has taken place in Ireland in the last decade. <Col N="1702"/>The accident rates per 100,000 employees show a steady decline in workplace accidents in Ireland as shown in the table below.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, the rate of deaths and injuries in Irish workplaces is unacceptable. During 2003, 67 people died and an estimated 20,900 people were absent from work for more than there days due to workplace injuries. In 2004, 50 people died in workplace accidents and to date this year there have been 22 fatalities.</P>
        <P>However, overall steady progress has been made as the workplace fatality rate has fallen significantly since 1998 when 70 people died in the workplace.</P>
        <P>This reduction in deaths and injuries should be seen against the background of an increase in the workforce of almost a quarter of a million workers since 1998.</P>
        <P>Internationally, rapid increases in the workforce usually lead to an increase in the fatal and non-fatal injury rate due to the introduction of inexperienced workers into the workplace. Thankfully, Ireland has been able to avoid such an increase.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority has a dual role of enforcement and prevention. Under its prevention strategy, published in 2004, the authority approaches the issue of days lost to Irish business through a range of measures and supports at individual workplace, sector and national level. In addition, the authority partners other significant organisations and the social partners to bring home the message of prevention on both human and economic grounds. The authority&rsquo;s programme of work for 2005 will further promote this preventive emphasis in its work in addition to continuing to inspect workplaces for compliance with legal requirements. </P>

        <askee>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</askee>
        <Quest>if he will <Col N="1702"/>meet with former workers at the Irish Fertilizer subsidiary Richardson&rsquo;s in Belfast who received inferior severance packages, particularly with respect to pensions following the closure of that plant, compared to their counterparts in other plants (details supplied) which closed at the same time.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>When Irish Fertilisers Industries Limited went into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, established a special fund &mdash; while there was no legal obligation to do so &mdash; of almost &euro;24.5 million to provide <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments to the former employees. Payments from the fund were <Col N="1703"/>made in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund, which has been endorsed by a ballot open to all employees. The basis for distribution was the same for all employees regardless of location.</P>
        <P>In addition, employees would have had certain statutory redundancy and other entitlements. While these would have varied somewhat reflecting the different arrangements in the two jurisdictions, I do not believe that this resulted in any significant variances in overall severance packages received.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, I am aware that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardson&rsquo;s pension fund, are likely to receive much reduced pension entitlements and that the staff in question are, understandably, very aggrieved about this position. The specific financial position of the Richardson&rsquo;s fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees&rsquo; investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.</P>
        <P>The trustees of the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme submitted a claim on the liquidation in relation to the shortfall in the scheme and I understand that the liquidator has now accepted, in principle, that the trustees have an admissible claim. However, there are a number of factors that will need to be determined before the amount of the claim that is admissible can be established. In addition, I understand that the UK Government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme. Depending on the outcome of both these developments, there is the prospect of some alleviation in the position faced by the active members of the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme.</P>
        <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Irish Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall which the pension scheme faces and I do not see any basis on which we could reasonably be expected to make good the shortfall involved. In the circumstances, I regret that I do not consider a meeting with former workers of IFI in Belfast is appropriate.</P>

        <Quest>the action he is taking to develop the indigenous manufacturing sector of the economy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal means of <Col N="1704"/>delivering direct assistance to indigenous manufacturing companies is through the national enterprise development agency, Enterprise Ireland. Enterprise Ireland can assist those indigenous manufacturing companies that are, or at least have the potential to be, export focused. I should point out that the decision to provide support to a client company is a day-to-day administrative matter for the agency concerned, and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland offers a set of sophisticated solutions tailored to the needs of its individual client companies throughout all regions. Each company is assigned a development adviser who works with the company across all business functions through the business development model, BDM, process. The BDM ensures that support is applied to critical business functions, namely: strategy, finance, research and development, marketing, human resources and production. Financial and non-financial support is provided to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success. Enterprise Ireland also provides expertise to companies in the indigenous manufacturing sector who wish to expand through increased export activity. Through its network of 33 international offices, Enterprise Ireland assists companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth.</P>
        <P>Research and innovation, both product and process development, is critical to success in the increasingly global marketplace. Enterprise Ireland encourages sustained levels of research and development activity through its RTI scheme and research and development initiatives. Research and development awareness campaigns are also run to demonstrate the benefits of such investment. Enterprise Ireland also fosters research collaboration between companies and colleges through instruments such as the innovation partnership initiative.</P>
        <P>To assist the drive towards competitiveness and productivity within manufacturing, Enterprise Ireland promotes the adoption of new technology at company level. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s specialist technologist team delivers mentoring and developmental supports to individual manufacturing companies.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness fund was set up to help small and medium enterprises overcome distinctive competitiveness difficulties. Under this fund, which closed in mid-2004, 97 applications, to the value of &euro;11.9 million, were approved for companies predominantly operating in the traditional manufacturing sectors. This investment together with other Enterprise Ireland supports and services will have a considerable impact on improving competitiveness in these companies well into the future. I have requested Enterprise Ireland to bring forward proposals to address the issues and action items outlined in the report of the Enterprise Strategy Group, which was endorsed by the Government <Col N="1705"/>in February 2005. It is expected that Enterprise Ireland will outline its approach in this regard as part of the launch of its new strategy, scheduled to take place early next month.</P>

	<P>As part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under Sustaining Progress, a review of the Employment Agency Act 1971 is being carried out by my Department.</P>
        <P>As part of this review, my Department published in May 2004, a discussion paper on the 1971 Act and requested submissions from the various interests in the sector, including the social partners. A total of nine submissions were received and were examined in detail by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently finalising a policy paper which, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General on some of the details, will be circulated to the various interests for further comment in the coming weeks. In this context, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions will be requested to submit any views that it may have on this policy paper. Following this second round of consultations, my Department will draft the heads of a Bill and seek Government approval to have a Bill drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. I hope to publish the Bill by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>As part of this review, I am currently considering that in future: employment agencies will be required to be registered with my Department rather than be licensed as at present; overseas agencies supplying workers to work in Ireland will also be required to be registered with the Department; employment agencies will be required to comply with the terms of a statutory code of practice, which will set out in detail the practices and standards which agencies would be expected to follow, this code will in particular, set out the employment rights of agency workers; a statutory monitoring and advisory committee, representative of all the various interests in the sector, will be established, this committee will oversee the statutory code of practice and make recommendations to me as the Minister of State <?oasys _ic20-?>with responsibility for labour affairs revoking or suspending registration and-or the prosecution of agencies which breach the code; and any employer who recruits a worker from an unregistered agency, either from Ireland or <Col N="1706"/>overseas, will be guilty of an offence and liable to prosecution.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 152 together.</P>
        <P>Shortly after the launch of the Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s report in 2004, the Government asked a high level committee under the chairmanship of my Department to advise on the most appropriate means to progress implementation of its recommendations. The Government recently considered and endorsed that committee&rsquo;s report, which was broadly supportive of the policy directions recommended by the Enterprise Strategy Group. This is underlined by the Government&rsquo;s intention to implement, either in full or with modifications, most of its recommendations. The report makes a valuable contribution to embedding strategies appropriate to the new realities and challenges facing the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The report contains more than 50 recommendations, directed at a wide range of Departments and agencies and this adds complexity to ensuring a smooth flow of implementing actions. To address this, I published an action plan to establish a focus on maintaining pace and momentum in implementation activity across the range of bodies and stakeholders involved. As part of the ESG&rsquo;s implementation process I will be making twice yearly reports to Government on progress achieved in putting the Government approved ESG&rsquo;s recommendations in place.</P>
        <P>As part of this process I also announced the setting up of an enterprise expert group comprising four senior representatives from the enterprise sector and relevant Secretaries General from Departments. I will rely on the advice and analysis of the expert group on implementation developments to inform my report to Cabinet and I will be making further announcements shortly about the composition of this group.</P>
        <P>The central theme of the ESG&rsquo;s recommendations concerns a strategic evolution to a more competitive, innovative and knowledge centred economy. To help create quality and sustainable <Col N="1707"/>employment we have to make sure Ireland continues to be an attractive place in which to invest and from which to undertake increasingly profitable business. Part of this process involves listening to business and responding to its needs with greater agility and clarity. As a contribution to this process I may invite one or more enterprise members of the expert group to make a presentation on particular issues to the Government meeting at which I will report on policy developments in the context of the ESG&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>When I published details of the Government&rsquo;s response to the ESG&rsquo;s report, I also asked Enterprise Ireland, EI, to review the type of supports it provides to enterprise and its organisational arrangements for this. In effect, I have asked EI to strategically refocus its business to reflect the policy recommendations provided by the Enterprise Strategy Group. This is not a review that can be undertaken quickly but I expect that I will be able to announce details about the agency&rsquo;s strategic developments within the next few weeks. This will include details about the business arrangements for providing marketing and technology supports to enterprise.</P>
        <P>The Government has approved the establishment of a new central co-ordination unit within Enterprise Ireland, which will provide city and county enterprise boards with central direction, technical support and shared services. Discussions have already commenced between my Department and the agencies regarding the steps necessary to implement the ESG&rsquo;s recommendation on this topic.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>Shortly after the launch of the Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s report in 2004, the Government asked a high level committee under the chairmanship of my Department to advise on the most appropriate means to progress implementation of its recommendations and the most suitable modes of implementation. The Government recently considered and endorsed that committee&rsquo;s report, which was broadly supportive of the policy directions recommended by the Enterprise Strategy Group. This is underlined by the Government&rsquo;s <Col N="1708"/>intention to implement, either in full or with modifications, virtually all its recommendations.</P>
        <P>The report contains more than 50 recommendations, directed at a wide range of Departments and agencies. The report makes a valuable contribution to embedding strategies appropriate to the new realities and challenges facing the Irish economy. I intend that those recommendations addressed to my Department will inform the strategic development of enterprise support policies and their delivery to businesses. The ESG&rsquo;s recommendations are an important part of the enterprise policy agenda and I recently published an action plan to give added impetus to their implementation. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I want to create the most competitive and supportive environment possible for business to invest and create long-term quality employment for the benefit of society.</P>
        <P>Regarding the ESG&rsquo;s recommendation that the boards of Forf&aacute;s, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland should have a number of directors in common and, in particular, a common chairperson, I acknowledge the need for effective co-ordination between the enterprise development agencies. Nevertheless, I consider that any recommendation regarding better agency co-ordination should acknowledge the fact that Forf&aacute;s has a statutory function to advise and co-ordinate IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland in relation to their functions. The co-ordination issue extends beyond the three agencies mentioned in the recommendation and a case can be made for including Science Foundation Ireland and F&Aacute;S in any such arrangements. The chief executives of these agencies are also represented on the Forf&aacute;s board. Enabling a common chairperson for only some of the boards under Forf&aacute;s could present governance difficulties and at this stage I would prefer to look at this recommendation from a different perspective My Department will have discussions with the development agencies with a view to identifying co-ordination problems that have arisen and devising means by which such might be dealt with.</P>
        <P>As regards recommendations which it is specifically not intended to implement, we have decided not to implement the recommendation that existing regulators for networked sectors should be replaced by a new regulatory body covering all networked sectors. This is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Government has also decided that the ESG&rsquo;s recommendation regarding the disaggregation of State procurement contracts for telecommunications services will be further considered by my colleagues, the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance.</P>

	<P>As the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment stated recently in the Seanad, the experience most migrant workers have to their employment in Ireland is a good one. This is borne out by a high level of renewals of work permits and the steady flow of people from the new member states. I am satisfied that exploitation does not take place on a wide scale but that, where it does, it needs to be stopped.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that with the finalisation of the preparation of the new employment permits Bill <Col N="1710"/>will put the employment permits system on a firm statutory footing. It will provide for greater accountability and transparency. The new legislation will also provide additional protection for migrant workers.</P>
        <P>I am also satisfied that the 50% increase in the number of labour inspectors which I announced last week will have a strong impact. I have particularly asked that the additional inspectors concentrate their efforts on sectors where there are concentrations of migrant workers.</P>
        <P>I have heard many positive comments in this House and by other parties as to the operational capability of the labour inspectorate and this expansion of the inspectorate will enable it and its colleagues who also work on the employment rights compliance side of the Department to provide an integrated service dedicated to ensuring people get their entitlements.</P>

	<P>The EC directive on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property deals with a number of matters concerning authors and other copyright holders, including rules on the renting of protected materials and authors&rsquo; rights generally. Its key provisions, including that of public lending right, were transposed into Irish law by the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may recall that, in reply to a question from him of last December, it was indicated that, while the 2000 Act created a public lending right in Irish law, Article 5.3 of the EC directive allowed member states to exempt certain kinds of establishments from the obligation to collect the rental right levy in favour of authors. Ireland, in its transposition of the directive, effectively exempted all public libraries from liability. Subsequently, it became apparent that the European Commission disagreed with our approach and notified us of its intention to take legal proceedings in the matter.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently had informal consultations with the European Commission and has indicated that our intent is to prepare proposals for consideration by Government in this matter. These proposals will relate to the putting in place of statutory provisions to provide for a mechanism to yield payment to authors for the lending of copies of their works by public libraries. My Department is working closely with the relevant Department responsible for the public library system, that is, the Department of the <Col N="1711"/>Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on the matter.</P>

	<P>Last year the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, identified electricity costs as one area of concern in the context of overall cost competitiveness in the economy. In its Statement on Prices and Costs 2004, the NCC noted that in the three years to September 2004 electricity prices for industry have increased by approximately 40%.</P>
        <P>My Department has carried out a review of the issues from an enterprise policy perspective. The review looked at the sensitivity of industrial and services sectors to electricity costs as a business cost. The findings are contained in a study, which is published on my Department&rsquo;s website<?oasys _jy?>at <i>http://www.entemp.ie/publications/trade/2005/<?oasys _jy?>electricitymarket.pdf.</i></P>
        <P>The study focused primarily on the two principal concerns of industry, namely, the supply capacity of the electricity market and the current unit cost of electricity. While my Department has not carried out a simulation exercise in the event of an energy crisis, the paper examined the price sensitivity of the enterprise sector to electricity prices. The study found that within manufacturing industries such as the pharmaceutical, electronics and the food, beverage and tobacco sectors there are a number of firms, which are particularly sensitive to increases in the unit cost of electricity. In terms of the service industry, tourism and research and development were also sensitive to electricity tariff increases.</P>
        <P>In relation to the electricity market, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has announced plans for a review of the sector. This review will examine the institutional arrangements and market structures and assess their appropriateness. The impetus for this review stems from the perceived difficulties relating to ESB&rsquo;s dominance and the need to attract new entrants and develop competition in the sector. On Monday, 21 February 2005, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources formally invited tenders from European and Irish consultancy firms to carry out this review. I understand that the Minister will announce the outcome of the tender process in the near future.</P>
        <P>My Department has forwarded its study on Ireland&rsquo;s electricity market to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as an input to its review of the electricity sector.</P>

        <Quest>the reason the proposed granting of aid to Intel Ireland in respect of Intel&rsquo;s FAB 24-2 investment in its Irish operation at Leixlip, County Kildare, was allowed to progress to such a stage that notification was given to the European Commission, only to be withdrawn upon comment by the Commission about its legality; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 97 together.</P>
        <P>The announcement of the proposed aid to Intel on 19 May 2004 pointed out that the grant was subject to EU approval. The proposed aid was required to be notified to the European Commission for approval under the multisectoral framework on regional aid for large investment projects. Under this framework, which came into general effect on 1 January 2004, large investment projects are generally not eligible for investment aid where, as in the case of Intel, the aid recipient accounts for more than 25% of the sales of the product concerned. However, the framework also provides that investment aid for such cases will be authorised where the company concerned creates, through genuine innovation, a new product market. Intel, IDA Ireland and my Department were satisfied that the company&rsquo;s proposal demonstrated that it would create a new product market through genuine innovation. Intel is one of the most innovative companies in the world with a track record, stretching over several decades, of creating new products and markets. However, the European Commission took a different view, based on a very narrow interpretation of the provision on which we were relying. As this was the first case in which this provision was applied, we had no reason to believe that the European Commission would take such a restrictive view.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to withdraw the notification, having consulted Intel, should not be interpreted to mean that we agree with the Commission&rsquo;s view. The formal investigation which the Commission proposed to hold would have entailed the Commission providing certain details of the company&rsquo;s proposal to third parties including, in particular, Intel&rsquo;s competitors. As the Commission had informed us that it did not believe it would approve the proposed aid, even after this procedure, the company&rsquo;s reluctance to participate in a pointless exercise and risk <Col N="1713"/>exposure of its business secrets was understandable.</P>
        <P>In relation to the implications of this case for aid for industrial projects generally, the vast majority of inward investment projects do not need to enter into this approval process. For the very small number that do, each project has to be examined in the context of its individual elements and the same issue would only arise if the company concerned has a market share of more than 25% in relevant product markets. While IDA Ireland considers the outcome of the Intel case to be unhelpful in the progress of investment projects of this size, it does not see this having an overall directly negative impact on Ireland&rsquo;s ability to attract foreign direct investment.</P>

	<P>I understand that the new rules are part of the ongoing development of a single euro payment area, which will facilitate cross-border payments such as credit transfers and direct debit payments. As such, the new rules are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>With regard to the effect of the rules on competition, I have not undertaken any study. However, I hope that the rules will enhance competition by easing access to markets and facilitating the payment by consumers for products and services across the EU.</P>

	<P>The parties to the mid-term review of part two of Sustaining Progress &mdash; pay and the workplace &ldquo;agreed to request the Labour Court to review the National Minimum Wage and to make a recommendation to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, to apply with effect from 1 May, 2005&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In February last the Labour Court recommended that the minimum wage should be increased to &euro;7.65 with effect from 1 May 2005. Subsequent to receiving this recommendation, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, was requested to undertake an assessment of the increase recommended by the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>In its assessment, the ESRI concludes that the increase in the minimum wage to &euro;7.65 can be implemented without a significant negative impact on employment and competitiveness.</P>
        <P>On the issue of consumer prices, the ESRI has calculated that the increase in the minimum wage to &euro;7.65 might add something in the order of 0.15 percentage points to the rate of consumer price inflation.</P>

	<P>The system of industrial relations in Ireland is essentially voluntary in nature. For situations, however, where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and where the internal procedures normally used by the parties have failed to resolve a dispute, the parties may avail of procedures set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and supported by the enhanced code of practice on voluntary dispute resolution. These procedures contain two distinct strands for settling the issues in dispute &mdash; a voluntary procedure and a fall-back legislative procedure.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 105 and 127 together.</P>
        <P>Sixteen investigations into company law matters were initiated by my predecessor in the period since 1997.</P>
        <P>In three cases, the High Court appointed, on an application by the Minister, inspectors under section 8 of the Companies Act 1990. The inspectors appointed to Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited presented their report to the High Court on 10 June 2002. The report was subsequently published and referred to the DPP. The inspectors appointed to National Irish Bank Limited and <Col N="1716"/>National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited presented their report to the High Court on 12 July 2004. The report was subsequently published. The court ordered that a copy of the report be referred to several relevant authorities, including the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation under section 14 of the Companies Act 1990 was completed in 1998. The report on this was referred to the DPP.</P>
        <P>One investigation was undertaken under section 59 of the Insurance Act 1989. The report on this was referred to the DPP as well as to the inspectors who undertook the section 8 investigation into that company.</P>
        <P>Eleven investigations were initiated by the Minister under section 19 of the Companies Act 1990. Six of these have been concluded. Of the six investigations completed, two of the reports were referred to the DPP. A number of summary prosecutions have since been successfully concluded in one case. One report provided an input into the successful application to the High Court for the appointment of inspectors under section 8 while the fourth report was passed to the relevant High Court inspectors. One report was completed in September 2002 and a further report was completed in March 2003. Both reports have been referred to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>Two of the 11 section 19 investigations were held up in legal appeals. These inquiries are now the responsibility of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>
        <P>In relation to the three remaining section 19 investigations, I refer Deputies to my answers of 24 February 2005 in reply to several questions on this matter. I am still considering the matter with the object of ensuring that the results of the authorised officer&rsquo;s investigations are made available to the relevant authorities, as quickly as possible, for any action they consider appropriate.</P>
        <P>The costs incurred since 1997 on company investigations initiated by or on behalf of my Department currently amount to approximately &euro;10.9 million. This amount does not include the salary costs of Civil Service staff working on a number of these investigations or the legal costs which are primarily being borne by the Vote of the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. Of the &euro;10.9 million expended, &euro;1.6 million relates to section 19 investigations by authorised officers and the remaining &euro;9.3 million was incurred by High Court inspectors appointed under section 8 &mdash;&euro;5.8 million in the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited and &euro;3.5 million in the case of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited.</P>
        <P>The question of recovering costs from the section 8 investigations does not arise until such time as the inspectors complete their investigations. In the case of the Ansbacher inquiry, the High Court proceedings taken by the State to recover the costs of the inquiry were settled out <Col N="1717"/>of court for the sum of &euro;1.25 million in favour of the State.</P>
        <P>In the case of National Irish Bank Limited-National Irish Bank Financial Services Limited, the court ordered that National Irish Bank pay the full costs of the investigation. The costs of the investigation have been borne by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I understand that Department has requested the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office to commence the process of recovering the full costs of the investigations from the bank.</P>
        <P>Section 19, as originally enacted, did not provide for the recoupment of costs. This has now changed with the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.</P>

        <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>Licensed employment agencies in the State are regulated by my Department and any complaints <Col N="1718"/>about specific agencies are followed up. My Department is not responsible for what may happen outside the State where a recruitment agency in another country may be involved.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 126, 139 and 219 together.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S employment programmes, which comprise community employment, CE, social economy, SE, and job initiative, JI, will provide over 25,000 places in 2005. I am informed by F&Aacute;S that the number of participants on community employment was 24,991 in January 2003, 19,848 in January 2004 and 22,194 in January 2005. There are currently about 21,600 persons participating on community employment, 1,970 on social economy and a further 1,920 participants on job initiative.</P><Col N="1719"/>
        <P>On foot of a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with the social partners, I decided that with effect from 10 November 2004 the three year cap would be removed for community employment participants aged 55 or over. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on community employment for a maximum of six years. The extension of the participation period from three to six years for over those over the age of 55 should ensure that there will be sufficient clients to fill the available places.</P>
        <P>I should add that the continuation of ringfencing and prioritisation for the essential services of child care, health related services and drugs task force clients and the extended participation on community employment by older workers will help to secure the continuity of community services generally.</P>
        <P>I am informed by F&Aacute;S that the rate of progression to employment for community employment participants was 41% in 2002 and 46% in 2003. An additional 7.5% of participants went on to further training or education in 2003. Job initiative participants progressed to employment at a rate of 61% in 2002 and 50% in 2003. A further 9% of job initiative participants took up further training of education courses in 2003. Progression rates for 2004 are not yet finalised. These progression rates highlight the strong contribution of community employment and job initiative programmes in assisting very disadvantaged persons to take up employment in the open labour market.</P>
        <P>In addition to F&Aacute;S employment programmes, a range of initiatives are in place to assist the reintegration of long-term unemployed persons and disadvantaged groups into the open labour market. These include &mdash; the national employment action plan preventative process, which entails the systematic engagement and referral by the Department of Social and Family Affairs of persons six months on the live register to F&Aacute;S for interview. In the period January 2003 to December 2004, 96,000 clients have been engaged under this process. The high supports process is a flexible measure designed to assist employment services officers in implementing a range of responses for clients who are experiencing major barriers in progressing from unemployment to the workforce. A budget of up to &euro;2,200 per person is available for this purpose. The high supports process commenced in 2003 and assisted 336 clients in that year. A further 370 clients availed of support in 2004. Gateway for women is one of the ways in which F&Aacute;S is adopting more flexible methods of delivering services to make it easier for women to return to work. It is a tailored response to individual needs and focuses on addressing concerns and difficulties experienced by women returnees such as flexibility of training and accessibility of services. At the end of 2004 approximately 2,000 women had taken part in this <Col N="1720"/>initiative. The pathways programme is a two-week group guidance programme for disadvantaged F&Aacute;S clients identified under the preventative process. The aim of the programme is to identify the most appropriate development pathway for each participant that will assist him or her to obtain and maintain employment. In 2004, approximately 1,000 clients attended 70 pathways programmes nationally. The range of initiatives in place are continually under review to ensure a positive outcome for participating clients.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>The 47 recommendations contained in the report of the Competition Authority are designed to make the insurance market in Ireland more open, transparent and competitive. Accordingly, I welcome the authority&rsquo;s findings and conclusions.</P>
        <P>However, responsibility for the implementation of the majority of the recommendations lies with the Department of Finance and the Irish Financial Regulatory Services Authority. In this regard I have recently written to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, asking how he plans to progress the implementation of the recommendations in his area.</P>
        <P>The remaining recommendations are directed at the Departments of Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland and the Courts Service. I am also writing to the relevant Ministers and bodies concerned in the context of progressing matters.</P>
        <P>Given the importance of an open and competitive insurance sector to consumers, businesses and the economy as a whole, I hope that each of the appropriate bodies will take the necessary measures to implement the recommendations as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The review of industrial performance and policy 2003 carried out detailed analysis of Irish industrial performance and policy over the previous decade, including the performance and role of the enterprise development agencies over that period. While the review made no specific recommendations relating to future policy or the role of the agencies, the analysis contained therein informed the work of the Enterprise Strategy Group whose report was published in July 2004. This report made a number of recommendations relating to the future role and activities of the enterprise agencies.</P>
        <P>In this regard many of the Enterprise Strategy Group&rsquo;s recommendations will have a strong influence on how the enterprise development agencies change and improve their client services. There, the ESG&rsquo;s report makes a valuable contribution to embedding strategies appropriate to the new realities and challenges facing the Irish economy. In this context the ESG&rsquo;s report contains more than 50 recommendations, directed at a wide range of Departments and agencies. This adds a certain complexity to ensuring a smooth flow of implementing actions. To address this I recently published an action plan, which was approved by Government in February of this year, to establish a focus on maintaining pace and momentum in implementation activity across the range of bodies and stakeholders involved. As part of this process I will be making twice yearly reports to Government on progress achieved in putting the Government approved ESG&rsquo;s recommendations in place.</P>
        <P>A number of the proposals set out in the action plan are directed specifically towards the operations, roles and organisational structure of the enterprise agencies and these are being acted upon at present. As such there are no plans to carry out a formal review of the enterprise agencies&rsquo; performance in the immediate future.</P>
        <P>Performance review, in a variety of manners, is an ongoing priority for my Department. For example, last year my Department completed an expenditure review of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s overseas office network as well as an expenditure review of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s property programme which were both in-depth and exhaustive reviews that involved cross-agency and departmental input. Further reviews are taking place &mdash; earlier this year my Department requested both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to conduct a full review of their respective regional development programmes to be finalised by the end of this year. Furthermore, my Department has also signalled to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland its intention to require them to undertake a complete suite of elementary reviews for each of their expenditure programmes over the next three years.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding the liquidation process for Irish Fertilizer Industries; if he is satisfied that all possible steps have been taken to protect the interests of former employees of Irish Fertilizer Industries who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation of the company; if he has information as to the proportion of pension entitlement that former workers, including those in Northern Ireland, are likely to receive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12089/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the liquidator has made considerable progress in realising the assets of the company and establishing the full extent of its liabilities and that he hopes to complete the liquidation process later this year. At this stage, the production sites at Arklow and Cork remain the principal assets yet to be realised. It is understood that contracts have been signed for the sale of the Arklow site and that it is hoped that the sale will close in May. The liquidator is also engaged in discussions with a number of parties who have expressed an interest in acquiring the Cork site. It is a matter solely for the liquidator to determine whether to accept any particular offer made.</P>
        <P>The State has already made a significant financial contribution to assist the former employees of Irish Fertiliser Industries. Following the decision by the board of IFI to put the company into liquidation, ICI and the State, the shareholders in IFI, established a special fund &mdash; while there was no legal obligation to do so &mdash; of almost &euro;24.5 million to provide <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments to the former employees of IFI. Payments from the fund were made in accordance with the basis for distribution determined by the trustee of the fund, which has been endorsed by a ballot open to all employees.</P>
        <P>In addition, the liquidator has admitted, as unsecured creditors in the liquidation, claims from the employees of the company to have entitlements in respect of the voluntary severance terms traditionally paid by the company. However, the dividend payable to the workers concerned, if any, can only be determined when <Col N="1723"/>all the assets of the company have been realised and all liabilities established. It must be emphasised that the amount, if anything, to be paid in due course in respect of such claims is a matter solely for determination by the liquidator.</P>
        <P>As regards pensions, I understand that the two main schemes covering employees in the Republic have sufficient funds to meet all the entitlements provided under the schemes. While I understand that the schemes may not be in a position to provide some additional discretionary benefits that members had hoped to receive, it would appear that the payment of such benefits would always have been conditional on sufficient funding being available to meet the costs involved. I understand that the trustees of the schemes involved have submitted claims to the liquidator in relation to this position and that he is considering the validity of these claims at present.</P>
        <P>I am aware that employees based in Belfast, who are deferred pensioners of the Richardson&rsquo;s pension fund, are likely to receive much reduced pension entitlements. The specific financial position of the Richardson&rsquo;s fund appears to have arisen primarily from a combination of the statutory rules which currently apply on the winding up of a pension fund in the UK and a shortfall in the assets of the Belfast fund compared with its liabilities as a result of the fund trustees&rsquo; investment strategy coupled with a significant fall in the equities market.</P>
        <P>I understand that the liquidator has accepted, in principle, that a claim on the liquidation, submitted by the trustees of the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme, is admissible. However, the amount of claim has yet to be established while the amount that might be recovered from the liquidation in due course will depend on the dividend rate for unsecured creditors generally. In addition, I understand that the UK Government has announced proposals to deal with the issue of pension shortfalls arising from insolvencies but I am not aware of the impact, if any, this may have on the shortfall in the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme. Depending on the outcome of these developments, there is the prospect of some alleviation in the position faced by the active members of the Richardson&rsquo;s scheme.</P>
        <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for the plight of the members affected by the shortfall that has arisen in the scheme, I am satisfied that the Irish Government does not have any obligations in respect of the shortfall that the pension scheme faces.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 116 together.</P>
        <P>The statistics referred to arise from the Review of Enterprise Ireland Supported High Potential Start-ups 1989-2004 conducted by Enterprise Ireland. The report is an internal report of Enterprise Ireland and as such is an operational issue for the agency and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has informed me that the report is a review of the performance of 470 Enterprise Ireland supported high potential start-up companies, HPSUs, that started between 1989 and June 2004. Of the 470 HPSUs that started in this period, 357 &mdash; 76% &mdash; firms are still trading as EI clients 21 &mdash; 4% &mdash; were taken over and 92 &mdash; 20% &mdash; are closed. In other words 80% of the companies are still trading in one form or another. Enterprise Ireland considers that the failure rate is low by most standards given the normal risk of starting a new business.</P>
        <P>The average number of start-ups per year has also increased significantly between 1989 and 2004. It has risen from an average of 17 new HPSUs per year in the 1989 to 1996 period to an average of 58 HPSUs per year in the period 2001 to 2003. During 2004, 65 new HPSUs were started and supported with a projected employment in these businesses of 1,900 within three years, the majority of jobs in which are high skilled positions. The review also found that there has been no appreciable increase in the failure rates, despite the substantial increase in the volume of start-ups.</P>
        <P>The economic importance of HPSUs is not underestimated by Enterprise Ireland. In 2003, the 357 companies still trading as EI clients had a combined direct employment of 7,458 people &mdash; the majority of positions in which were highly skilled jobs &mdash; and total sales of &euro;979 million. This represents a very substantial positive economic impact.</P>
        <P>EI will not be complacent and will seek to further increase the success rate of HPSUs. For half of those HPSUs that fail, this failure occurs within the first three years. This &ldquo;valley of death&rdquo; period has been highlighted as an area where EI is to devote more resources and effort, including: a team based approach to bring the extensive experience and a range of expertise to bear at this critical stage; a joint approach by EI staff in Ireland and overseas to assist early stage companies to identify and secure key customer reference sites; a more direct and supportive approach to <Col N="1725"/>assisting companies to develop and augment their management team and board capabilities; and a milestone funding based approach to the provision of EI funding to an increased number of the start-ups phasing funding in line with realistic targets.</P>

	<P>During the years 2003 and 2004 IDA client companies made a total of 39 first time visits to the north-west region. Of this number, 14 visits were made to Letterkenny and two were made to Buncrana.</P>
        <P>On 31 March 2005, I announced that 423 jobs were to be created in the north-west region in IDA supported companies &mdash; 300 in Toucan, the consumer telecoms business of IDT Corporation, at its new customer service centre in Sligo and 123 software development jobs at SITA Inc., in Letterkenny. Discussions on further job creation in the area are ongoing with a number of other companies.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland, which is the agency charged with attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland, has indicated that 2,778 jobs were created by IDA client companies in the north-west region in the last five years. IDA is working closely with its existing base of companies in the north-west. One of the challenges facing companies in the north-west is in the area of competitiveness and this has resulted in job losses in sectors such as textiles and clothing and low-end manufacturing. Where a company has plans to introduce new functions, new technologies or products, IDA will assist the company where possible to make new investments that lead to new jobs.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is also involved with Invest Northern Ireland in the creation of a virtual cross-Border technology park incorporating business parks in Letterkenny and Derry city. The project rationale is to create a business zone with sufficient critical mass to allow the north west region to compete more favourably for inward investment.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has assured me it is committed to regional development, that it forms a core part of its strategy and that it is working with relevant national and local partners to develop and build the infrastructure necessary to make locations like the north-west competitive for international businesses.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in Donegal, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of delivering the <Col N="1726"/>maximum possible level of additional jobs for the north-west region.</P>

	<P>Arising from the success of the Irish economy over the last decade there has been a considerable increase in the numbers in employment and thus the demand for labour. This demand has been partly met by increased participation, particularly by women, in the labour force.</P>
        <P>The continuing growth of the economy is dependent on the ongoing expansion of the labour force. One of the main challenges facing us is the ability to meet this expansion and greater female participation will continue to be a very important element in this regard. The current employment rate for women in Ireland is 57.2%, which represents an increase of 12.6% since 1997. At EU level, under the Lisbon Agenda, a female employment rate target of 60% to be met by 2010 has been set. The Employment in Europe 2004 report predicts that Ireland is likely to reach this target.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to pursue policies-initiatives in the areas of child care, taxation, social benefits and flexible, family-friendly working arrangements to encourage and enable women to take up employment.</P>
        <P>A number of specific measures aimed at encouraging greater participation by women are being undertaken by F&Aacute;S, including: expanding the workforce programme, the aim of which is to provide a gateway for women returners into the labour market; and the introduction of the child care allowance scheme which aims to facilitate more people, particularly women, to take up F&Aacute;S training programmes, with a view to taking up employment in the mainstream economy.</P>

	<P>The Health and Safety Authority will receive a grant of &euro;16.098 million in 2005, which is an increase from &euro;14.994 million in 2004 and &euro;13.607 million in 2003. In addition, further allocation of funds were made towards workplace safety projects which are implemented in con<Col N="1728"/>junction with the construction safety partnership: &euro;301,000 in 2003, &euro;266,000 in 2004 and &euro;301,000 will again be made available in 2005. The authority has a staff of 163, 100 of whom are specifically involved in inspection and investigation activities and in the enforcement of health and safety legislation.</P>
        <P>This year the authority will increase the number of inspections to be undertaken and the associated enforcement. Priority will be given to serious accidents and complaints, which will be investigated and the necessary actions taken to guarantee the required improvements. A primary emphasis for the authority is on the prevention of workplace accidents through new initiatives, alliances and targeted programmes. I am confident that, in the context of the overall allocation of resources, the authority can carry out its objectives over the coming year.</P>
        <P>While the statistics for workplace fatalities for 2004 showed a decline at 50 overall, the number of people killed in work related accidents in 2005 to date is 22, an alarming statistic which is completely unacceptable. Workplace safety has to be on the top of employers and workers&rsquo; agendas. Employers need to put in place a proper health and safety management system to reduce and eliminate these needless deaths and injuries. Workers must be safety conscious and should not engage in activities that could endanger their own safety or the safety of others.</P>

The proposed employment permits Bill 2005, which will govern the issue of all employment permits for nationals from outside the European Economic Area, EEA, will put the existing employment permit administrative arrangements on a sound legislative footing and thereby provide greater accountability and transparency. The EEA comprises the 25 EU member states, Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.</P>

	<P>The expert group on future skills needs, EGFSN, was set up by Government in 1997 to develop national strategies to tackle the issue of skills needs, manpower estimating and training for business and education in Ireland. The EGFSN has published many reports that have identified in a systematic way the skills needs of different sectors and advised on the actions needed to address them.</P><Col N="1731"/>
        <P>The expert group future skills needs made 227 specific recommendations between 1997 and March 2005 aimed at ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s skills needs are met in a timely fashion. These recommendations spanned a number of sectors including ICT, engineering, life science and biotechnology, food processing, construction and finance. The expert group has also examined vertical skills issues, including soft skills, sales and marketing, management and most recently a language skills report which is about to be published. A recent report from the EGFSN which considered the impact of increasing the national expenditure on research and development in line with the Barcelona target, projected a requirement for an additional 8,000 researchers in the Irish economy over the period to 2010. The expert group has also pointed to the need to enhance innovation and sales capabilities as being critical for the future success of Irish exporting small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made on these recommendations including. There have been substantial increases in third level and training course places to address the supply shortages in ICT and life sciences. The promotion of careers in science, technology and engineering, SET, has been one of the key messages adopted by the expert group. SET skills will form the backbone of an innovation-driven, knowledge economy. The Government launched an integrated awareness campaign, discover science and engineering, in 2003 with a mandate to increase the interest in science and engineering at both primary and post-primary education, with a view to encouraging more students to pursue science and engineering studies and ultimately careers. In the current year it has a budget of &euro;2 million. The need for basic information in relation to training provision has been addressed by the establishment of a comprehensive national trainer&rsquo;s database by F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Since its inception in 1997, the analysis and recommendations contained in the reports of the expert group on future skills needs have contributed to ensuring that no major impediment to economic progress has occurred as a result of failure to anticipate specific skills needs within the key sectors of the economy. The mandate of the EGFSM was expanded in 2004 to incorporate the role previously discharged by the National Training Advisory Council which was set up to advise on the strategy for enterprise training in Ireland. Apart from the action taken in the form of making recommendations and publishing reports, the expert group has also sought ways seeking to help form opinion by ensuring that the findings of its research become more widely known and are reflected in debate on future skills needs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, labour inspectors of my Department undertook 462 inspections under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. So far this year, the inspectorate has undertaken 143 inspections under the legislation. Inspectors operate on the basis of achieving compliance. Where an inspection occurs leading to a detection of infringements, the employer is required to rectify the infringements detected. Failure to do so to the satisfaction of the labour inspectorate within a specified period results in the initiation of legal proceedings.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should be aware that rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission &mdash; a body independent of my Department &mdash; also investigate complaints of breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. The Deputy should also be aware that there are some 19 employment regulation orders drawn up through the joint labour committee system that regulates statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in the various sectors where these apply. Ensuring compliance with the minimum pay amounts, terms and conditions forms a major element of the work of the inspectorate. These norms are established under employment regulation orders, EROs. In 2004, 486 inspections were made under EROs and so far this year, to the end of March, 101 inspections have been undertaken.</P>
        <P>As agreed in the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, four additional labour inspectors were appointed earlier this year. This increased the complement of inspectors to 21. The review of the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate, which was prepared as a discussion document to assist consideration within the social partnership context, examined a range of possibilities around the operation of the labour inspectorate and offered a spectrum of possibilities ranging from a compliance regime where the initiative would move more toward the complainant, with the labour inspectorate offering support to a model where the right of initiative would be with the labour inspectorate who would conduct a hands-on approach. Both models endeavour to present either ends of a spectrum of possible options for compliance checking and enforcement. The purpose of their inclusion is primarily to stimulate debate and signal that fundamental changes in approach must be considered.</P>
        <P>On 12 April 2005, the Minister, Deputy Martin, announced that he is appointing additional labour inspectors who will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. <Col N="1733"/>The group will consist of a team leader and ten labour inspectors. The additional inspectors will strengthen the labour inspectorate&rsquo;s capacity to ensure that workers in these sectors receive their entitlements under employment rights legislation. This expansion of the inspectorate will bring the authorised number of labour inspectors to 31.</P>

	<P>No distinction is made in employment rights legislation as between Irish and migrant workers. For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996. This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus, all employee legislation applies to migrant workers.</P>
        <P>Equally, the labour inspectorate and the compliance section as a whole of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment makes no distinction as between Irish and migrant workers both as regards the provision of advice and enforcement activity. The recent announcement by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the provision of an additional ten labour inspectors and a team leader to the labour inspectorate will also assist in this area especially as the Minister has asked that they have a primary focus sectors where there are concentrations of migrant workers.</P>

To reflect the seriousness of the offence, the commission also recommended that the legislation should provide for an unlimited fine, or that in certain circumstances, an individual high managerial agent should also be subject to imprisonment of up to five years. The commission is currently considering submissions on its consultation paper. My Department is already in receipt of advice from the Office of the Attorney General to the effect that the issue of corporate killing has broad implications.</P>
        <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, which took place on 23 and 24 November last, and in my answer to a similar question by Deputy Costello on Thursday, 24 February 2005, Government policy is to await the review by the Law Reform Commission which, I understand, is due for publication this year and to then decide what is to be done with regard to the issue of corporate manslaughter.</P>
        <P>The provisions in section 80 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004, currently at Report Stage in the House, entitled liability of directors and officers of undertakings are more explicit in relation to the assignment of responsibility than an existing provision in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. These provisions will assign responsibility to individual directors, managers or other similar officers for offences related to occupational safety and health law and therefore mean that actual persons in managerial roles can be prosecuted for breaches of worker safety law and are potentially liable to heavy fines and prison sentences.</P>
        <P>However, it is worth noting that directors and managers of companies have in the past been prosecuted for failures under occupational safety law which resulted in death or serious injury to workers.</P>

	<P>Labour inspectors are empowered to enter any premises in the State where an employee is employed, or the work that an employee is employed to do is directed and controlled, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated.</P>
        <P>Alternatively, if a seafarer is not satisfied that he or she is being paid his or her statutory minimum entitlement under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, he or she could refer the matter to a rights commissioner. A decision of a rights commissioner under the 2000 Act may include an award of arrears of pay owing to the seafarer under the 2000 Act and his or her reasonable expenses in bringing the case against the employer.</P>
        <P>As regards the working time of seafarers, this is regulated by SI 532 of 2003 entitled European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Organisation of Working Time) Regulations 2003. Under these regulations, which are administered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the working time of seafarers can be enforced by authorised officers who, in carrying out their work, have the power to board ships registered in and outside the State. In so far as holiday legislation is concerned, seafarers who are not given their statutory entitlement to annual leave and public holidays by their employer under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 are entitled to refer the matter to a rights commissioner for redress. The rights commissioner is empowered under the 1997 Act to require the employer to comply with any of the provisions of the 1997 Act that have been breached and to award compensation to the employee up to a limit of two years remuneration of the employee.</P>
        <P>The question of the re-registering of vessels in non-EU countries is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

	<P>As part of the mid-term review of part two of Sustaining Progress, the social partners, namely, ICTU and IBEC, agreed to request the Labour Court to review the national minimum wage and to make a recommendation to the Minister to apply from 1 May 2005. ICTU requested the Labour Court to examine the minimum wage in September 2004.</P>
        <P>On 1 February the Labour Court submitted its recommendation that the minimum wage should be increased from the current rate of &euro;7 per hour to &euro;7.65 per hour from 1 May 2005. The national minimum wage legislation sets out a series of steps, which the Labour Court must undertake in its examination of the minimum wage. In addition, the legislation provides that the procedures of the Labour Court in respect of an application or hearing to examine the minimum wage shall be as determined by the Labour Court. I have no role in how the Labour Court arrives at its recommendation.</P>
        <P>The legislation provides that I have three months to consider the Labour Court recommendation. In considering the recommendation, I am required to take into account the impact the proposed rate may have on employment; the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness. To assist in my deliberations, the ESRI was requested to undertake an assessment of the impact of the increase in the minimum wage.</P>
        <P>I met with several employer representative groups, who sought meetings with me, to outline their positions on the proposed increase. Having considered the matter, I decided to increase the minimum wage from &euro;7 to &euro;7.65 with effect from 1 May 2005, in accordance with the Labour Court recommendation.</P>

	<P>Broad employment and training objectives and policies to promote the employment of disabled people, including schemes, programmes <Col N="1740"/>and services are reflected in the statements of strategy and business plans of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S programmes and the various support measures are based on the policies of the Department, which are developed through a three-dimensional approach involving the following: facilitating the progression of disabled people into sustainable employment through the development of their skills; stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution which disabled people can make to their business, and encouraging companies to consider recruiting disabled people to fill their vacancies; and providing specific employment supports for disabled people and employers.</P>
        <P>People with disabilities now benefit from the full range of F&Aacute;S training programmes and services and F&Aacute;S also provides an extensive range of schemes and grants to promote the employment of people with disabilities in the private sector, including: the disability awareness training support scheme; employment retention grant; work and equipment adaptation grant; job interview interpreter grant; and personal reader grant and employment support scheme.</P>
        <P>In addition, F&Aacute;S also operates on behalf of the Department: a pilot programme for employment of people with disabilities, grant assistance for commercially viable enterprises of which at least 50% of the employees are people with disabilities; and a supported employment programme, an open labour market initiative that works to place and support people with different types and varying degrees of disability who need the initial support of a job coach to obtain or maintain employment.</P>
        <P>I have also secured additional funding for the development and introduction of a new full-time employment support scheme for people with disabilities on a three-year pilot basis. A budget line of &euro;10 million has been established for the scheme for 2005. This comprises the current provision of &euro;5 million for the combined employment support scheme and the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities, and an additional &euro;5 million. The scheme will be implemented by F&Aacute;S this summer.</P>
        <P>The total number of people with disabilities placed in employment and training by F&Aacute;S in 2004 was 8,608 compared to 8,459 in 2003. The wide-ranging National Disability Authority report entitled Towards Best Practice in the Provision of Further Education, Employment and Training Services, contains 29 recommendations which have implications for several Departments, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the area of employment and training provision. In this area, 19 of these recommendations have policy and or operational implications for F&Aacute;S under the aegis of the Department. F&Aacute;S is addressing these recommendations in conjunction with the Department. They are of assistance in the context of the ongoing monitor<Col N="1741"/>ing and review of policy and programme provision consistent with providing the most efficient services possible to people with disabilities.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s objective in the period ahead is to consolidate the significant value added in advancing the employment and training agenda since assuming policy responsibility for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities.</P>

The Government opposed this Bill at the time and the substantive position on the matter has not changed in the interim.</P>
        <P>The Fine Gael proposals do not represent a comprehensive or up-to-date agenda for the modern Irish consumer. On 2 March last I received a comprehensive report from the consumer strategy group, which includes its recommendations for the development of a new consumer policy. This group comprised individuals with the expertise and experience to undertake the task and has engaged in an extensive public consultation exercise as well as taking into account the experience of other countries in implementing consumer policy. I am discussing the group&rsquo;s final report with my colleagues in Government and hope to publish the report shortly and announce my intentions in regard to progressing the group&rsquo;s recommendations at that time.</P>
        <P>One aspect of the Fine Gael proposal is the increase of certain consumer protection fines to a maximum of &euro;3,000. Legislation to this effect was published by my Department on 31 March last and is being taken in the Seanad. I look forward to the Deputy&rsquo;s support for this legislation in due course.</P>

	<P>In the three-month period since the Taoiseach led this trade mission there has been significant progress. This is additional to contracts valued at about &euro;126 million signed in the course of the trade mission.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland arranged for the education sector to participate in trade fairs in Beijing and Shanghai, where 23 institutions were represented. Best estimates suggest that universities and colleges following up on partnerships signed during the January trade mission will recruit in excess of 400 additional students who plan to begin their college careers in September of this year. This represents estimated revenue to Irish colleges of approximately &euro;3 million, and an additional &euro;3 million spend here.</P>
        <P>In the information technology sector, one company has since established its sales and marketing office in Beijing and another has reported that a new partnership signed during the Shanghai leg of the mission has generated its first order. A food company that was represented on the trade <Col N="1743"/>mission has received a first trial order for the shipment of product to China. Should this be successful, it is expected that over &euro;500,000 in product will be shipped this year. Another food company is about to announce the opening of its first China office in Shanghai.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with client companies that participated on the mission and to assist them in maximising opportunities in the Chinese marketplace. In addition to these commercial developments, and following commitments made during the January trade mission, Enterprise Ireland is participating in an information technology fair in Dalian in June and in the Xiamen Trade and Investment Fair in September. It is also organising missions to China for companies from the aerospace sector and the furniture sector in September of this year.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Gender gaps in participation in certain sectors or occupations reflect, to a certain extent, the different roles that men and women have traditionally played in society. This has resulted in the situation where, for example, women are over-represented in caring roles, such as teaching and nursing, while men continue to dominate in science, engineering and technology. This is a complex issue involving several factors including gender stereotyping in education which influences the career choices made by women and men.</P>
        <P>This is a cross-cutting issue involving several Departments such as the Department of Education and Science, which, through the school system, encourages an increased uptake of courses in the science and mathematics fields by girls; and the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, under its equality for women measure, supports a number of projects aimed at increasing the number of women in science, engineering and technology.</P>
        <P>I recently announced an initiative being undertaken by Science Foundation Ireland aimed at boosting the number of women scientists in <Col N="1744"/>Ireland and addressing the gender imbalance in the research community. While women are well represented at undergraduate and postgraduate level in most scientific and technological disciplines in Ireland, a greater equilibrium is required in the workplace. Under the SFI initiative, women who have left careers in science, engineering and technology will be encouraged to return to their professions.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a policy of promoting and encouraging the entry of women into apprenticeships. It offers a bursary to private and public sector employers who recruit female apprentices under the apprenticeship system in the currently designated trades. F&Aacute;S is also in the process of developing a range of new apprenticeships in areas that are more attractive to women.</P>
        <P>In addition, for women and men who wish to enter non-traditional sectors, there is legislative support, under the Employment Equality Act 1998, which outlaws discrimination in employment on nine grounds, including gender.</P>

	<P>The report of the labour inspectorate into the wages and hours worked by Turkish workers is the subject of a High Court injunction. Accordingly, I am not in a position to inform the Deputy concerning any of the contents or recommendations in the report. I cannot indicate definitively, at this stage, the specific actions which I may take with regard to these allegations.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department visited Finansbank in Holland on 14 and 15 April. The visit took place outside the scope of the labour inspector&rsquo;s report and outside the scope of the High Court injunction. This had been agreed with Gama Construction Turkey and Gama Construction Ireland prior to the visit taking place.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the visit was to clarify the access of Gama workers, past and present, to the so-called Dutch accounts in the workers&rsquo; names in Finansbank. My officials brought with them proxy forms supplied by Gama and Matheson <Col N="1745"/>Ormsby Prentice, solicitors, signed by some Gama workers, giving them access to their account details and also proxy forms, supplied by SIPTU and Deputy Joe Higgins, giving similar access.</P>
        <P>In respect of all 16 accounts for which they had proxy forms, Finansbank supplied the following material: initial authorisation forms, authorising Finansbank to open a personal account in the name of the worker; initial payment authorisation forms, instructing Finansbank to transfer all incoming funds from the personal account into Ryder Investment N. V., and also bank statements.</P>
        <P>In respect of 15 of the above accounts, supplied by Matheson Ormsby Prentice, solicitors, refund instructions had been signed by the workers. The Finansbank representatives were helpful in discussing all of these documents and their implications. In particular, Finansbank assured my officials that all 15 refund instructions had been completed successfully, as shown on the bank statements. They explained that Ryder Investment had given Finansbank an irrevocable standing order, such that if any Gama worker requested a refund of all the transfers that had been made from his personal account to Ryder Investment, Finansbank would make the refund with interest into the personal account.</P>
        <P>They also assured my officials that all account requests from workers would be processed quickly via acceptable intermediaries, for example, Gama, Matheson Ormsby Prentice, SIPTU etc.</P>
        <P>Over 600 refund requests went to Finansbank via Gama and Matheson, Ormsby Prentice last week and my officials were assured by Finansbank that such moneys as were in their Finansbank accounts had been transferred from Finansbank to their personal accounts in Is Bank in Turkey. I am not in a position to state whether the moneys have reached the individual workers&rsquo; accounts and that they may gain access to the funds.</P>
        <P>A further 200 plus requests for bank statements were submitted to Finansbank last Friday by SIPTU and Deputy Joe Higgins. My officials were assured that these requests would be processed by close of business yesterday 19 April. Late last night my officials received a listing of 231 account holders, account balances and the statement that the moneys were being transferred to a series of bank accounts in Is Bank in Turkey. Finansbank advises that these transfers, totalling &euro;4,809,840.37 will have value from today. These transfers appear contrary to the instructions given by the account holders, namely, the Gama workers who, in accordance with the SIPTU proxy request, only wanted a statement of account. I am advised by Finansbank that the transfers from the individual accounts were effected &ldquo;upon instructions of our principals Gama Endustri AS that we are in receipt of an <Col N="1746"/>irrevocable payment instruction from them to effect the below detailed transfers to the accounts on the Gama employees in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat surprised at this development as the agreement reached with the bank provided for the individual workers giving personal instructions to the bank as regards their accounts. I am not in a position to state whether the moneys have reached the individual workers&rsquo; accounts and that they may gain access to the funds. My officials will make further inquiries.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the job losses in several companies in County Limerick which are significant setbacks to the locality. I am concerned for the workers who are losing their jobs as well as their families and the wider community in the county.</P>
        <P>The full services of F&Aacute;S, particularly in regard to re-training and up-skilling, are made available to such workers if the workers wish to avail of those services. F&Aacute;S has already been in contact with staff from the companies involved.</P>
        <P>Replacing jobs is a tough challenge and is a central goal in the achievement of balanced regional development. The industrial development agencies work closely with the local authority and other local interests to deliver the best solution in this regard. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal for County Limerick through the prioritisation of development and investment in the linked gateway of Limerick-Shannon to allow foreign direct investment to flow to the area. The emphasis is on attracting new knowledge intensive projects in information and communications technology, international services, medical technologies and life sciences.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is committed to the development of the mid-west region and is actively promoting it for new foreign investment. In 2005 to date, there have been five first time site visits to Limerick city and county and there were 19 first time site visits in 2004. IDA Ireland works closely with the local educational infrastructure in the University of Limerick and Limerick Institute of Technology, to foster collaboration between industry and academia with a focus on research and development and new business sectors.</P>
        <P>Shannon Development is willing to explore eligible business proposals for County Limerick and is also an active member of local groups such as West Limerick Resources Limited. The agency is also actively involved with the Newcastle West <Col N="1747"/>Chamber of Commerce and will work closely with it to ensure that its resources are brought to bear in addressing the situation in County Limerick. Shannon Development and the local county enterprise board are also working with the Killeedy committee in County Limerick. Furthermore, Shannon Development is planning to develop a new &euro;5 million business park in Newcastle West and has also completed approvals for three new advance factories in Ballylanders, Rathkeale, and Newcastle West at a total investment cost of &euro;3 million. With the goodwill and efforts of all involved in the area, the job needs of County Limerick will continue to be addressed.</P>

	<P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, the State body charged with overall responsibility for administration, enforcement and promotion of workplace safety and health has provided the key figures for construction industry for the last five years which are set out in the table.</P>
        <P>These figures show an overall increase in the number of accidents reported and a slight decrease in the rate of fatalities when taken over a five year period. However, the expansion in construction employment, which has increased from 166,300 in 2000 to 206,000 in 2004, has an effect on the number of reportable accidents. The increase in reported accidents can also be partly attributed to better reporting as management <Col N="1749"/>systems are put in place and include an accident reporting mechanism.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the Health and Safety Authority inspectors visited over 5,000 construction sites and closed 26, one by court order and 25 by <Col N="1750"/>agreement. The construction sector is one of the two priority areas targeted by the authority because of its size, the number of risks which exist and the number of accidents in the sector. This targeting will continue in 2005.</P><Col N="1749"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Irish companies, especially those in the traditional manufacturing sector, face particular difficulties in expanding due to productivity and competitiveness issues. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness fund was established to help increase productivity levels and build competitiveness of companies operating in the traditional manufacturing sector. Some 97 applications, to the value of &euro;11.9 million, were approved for these manufacturing companies. Total investments forecast in these companies as a result of Enterprise Ireland investments amounted to &euro;41 million over a two-year period. This investment together with other Enterprise Ireland supports and services will have a considerable impact on improving the competitiveness of the companies and help position them to compete in international markets.</P>
        <?oasys _dc24-?><P>The evolution of the global economy offers potentially limitless opportunities for indigenous companies. Exploiting the prospects offered by newer export markets such as central and eastern Europe and by countries such as China beyond Ireland&rsquo;s more traditional markets is critical for future growth. However, the growth of these regions has also resulted in increased competitive pressures for indigenous companies in sustaining and growing market share. Furthermore, moves by multinational companies to reduce sub-supplier numbers also entail increased competition for some Irish firms placing increased pressure on a possible avenue of indigenous company growth. Consequently, as a country with a relatively limited domestic market for products and services, it is imperative that Irish companies wishing to expand continue to seek opportunities to grow through increased internationalisation activities. Ambitious companies will need to win contracts and market position in existing and new markets internationally.</P><Col N="1750"/><?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland through its network of 33 overseas offices, assists clients to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth. Services provided include arranging access to international buyers and increasing the number of in-market trade promotion activities.</P>
        <P>Success in exporting requires a product that can compete internationally. Effectively and creatively using technology to develop new and innovative products and services based on evolving customer demands will be crucial to the future success of Irish companies. Research and innovation, in product and process development, is critical. Consequently, Enterprise Ireland is focused on driving higher levels of research and development activity through the rural transport initiative scheme and several research and development initiatives and undertakes research and development awareness campaigns to encourage activity by non-research and development performers. It also assists researchers to commercialise research in order to get technology out of third level institutions and into companies so that they are in a position to realise new sales opportunities. The commitment to research and development is emphasised by the fact that an annual budget of &euro;80 million to invest in companies and research institutions for market-led projects is administered by Enterprise Ireland.</P>

        <Quest>the terms and conditions in regard to treatment of workers that foreign-based construction companies tendering for public contracts in this country are required to meet; if he is satisfied that all such terms and conditions are being met; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to reiterate that no distinction is made in Irish employment rights legislation between the terms and conditions of Irish as opposed to migrant workers. Section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Workers) Act 2001 provides, that for the avoidance of doubt, that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland. This is in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus, all employee legislation applies to migrant workers.</P>
        <P>In so far as the construction industry is concerned the industry rate, also known as the joint council industrial norm, JCIN, sets out agreed rates up to 31 March 2006. Since 1 April 2005 the rates range from &euro;16.44 for a craftsperson, through &euro;13.15 for a basic operative to &euro;5.48 for <Col N="1753"/>a first-year apprentice. I should, however, point out that the minimum rates of pay that can be enforced by the labour inspectorate in respect of the construction sector are those contained in the registered employment agreement, REA, which has been deposited with the Labour Court and sets the rates of pay with effect from 3 February 1992 up to 1 April 1997. The rates under the REA range from &euro;8.09 for a craftsperson through &euro;6.48 for a basic operative to &euro;2.69 for a first-year apprentice.</P>
        <P>The REA rate is out of line with the industry norm or JCIN. However, the amendment of the REA is a matter for the parties concerned, that is, the unions and employers. The process of revising or varying the REA rate had been delayed since 1998 on foot of judicial review proceedings being initiated. However, I understand that the REA may now be revisited following on a recent judgment in the High Court.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Neville</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
        <Quest>the number and details of official days of mourning over the past ten years.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12339/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no formal definition of a national day of mourning and therefore no standard criteria by which to determine the form of official mourning, which has been observed in different ways, depending on the nature of the event.</P>
        <P>A decision to direct that the national flag be flown at half mast is a form of official mourning, as reflected in international practice. Occasions on which this has been ordered over the past ten years include: the death of former President François Mitterand, June 1996; the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, September 1997; the death of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, September 1997; the death of Mother Theresa of Calcutta, September 1997; following the Omagh bombing, August 1998; the death of former Taoiseach Jack Lynch, October 1999; the death of the Queen Mother of the UK, April 2002; the bomb blasts in Madrid, March 2004; the death of former President Ronald Reagan, June 2004; the Beslan North Ossetia atrocity, September 2004; and the South Asia tsunami, December 2004.</P>
        <P>The Government decided that a special national day of mourning should be held on Friday, 14 September 2001, in commemoration of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the United States on Tuesday, 11 September and as a gesture of solidarity with the people of the United States. On the day, three minutes&rsquo; silence was observed. The T&aacute;naiste signed an order under the Organisation of Working Time Act allowing businesses to close on the day. With limited exceptions such as emergency services, all schools, Departments and offices were requested to close.</P>
        <P>As a mark of respect following the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, the Government decided that the national flag should be flown, on <Col N="1754"/>all public buildings equipped with a flagpole, at half mast beginning on Sunday, 3 April 2005 until midnight on the day of the funeral and requested that the flag should be similarly flown on private buildings that fly the flag. The Government also decided to cancel the Government meeting which was due to take place in Cork on Wednesday, 6 April 2005 and other associated events to mark Cork as the European City of Culture for 2005.</P>
        <P>When Friday, 8 April 2005 was confirmed as the day of the Pope&rsquo;s funeral, the Government decided that any of its own workers who wished to do so, would be facilitated to attend appropriate religious services on the day. In addition, it was decided to allow boards of management of schools to have the option of closing for the day of the funeral, which would not be required to be made up for purposes of the school year. Schools exercising the option to close were asked to give the maximum possible notice to parents. The Government also expressed a wish that workers in the private sector would be facilitated by their employers, on a voluntary basis, to participate in religious ceremonies.</P>
        <P>Similar observance of official mourning occurred on the death of Popes John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul I.</P>

	<P>There are three parts in the Children Act 2001 which specifically relate to the health area. Part 2 establishes for the first time on a statutory basis the family welfare conference. Part 3 amends the Child Care Act 1991 by inserting two new parts, Part 4A, which imposes duties on the Health Service Executive in relation to a child who may be in need of special care or protection, and Part 4B, relating to private foster care. Part 11 provides for the establishment of the special residential services board on a statutory basis to co-ordinate residential services for children detained in detention <Col N="1760"/>schools and in special care units. I am pleased to say that Part 11 was fully commenced on 7 November 2003 and that almost all of Parts 2 and 3 were commenced in September 2004. Regulations for family welfare conferences and special care units were also commenced in September 2004. The certification process of special care units is under way and this requires the amendment of the regulations as a consequence of the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The sections of the Children Act 2001, which the Minister for Health and Children has responsibility for commencing and which have not yet been commenced, are sections 23D, 77 and 7(1)(<i>a</i>), 10(<i>a</i>) and 13(2), which relate to section 77.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive, the Departments of Education and Science and Justice Equality and Law Reform, and the National Children&rsquo;s Office in the context of the co-ordinated phased implementation of the Children Act 2001. The commencement of section 77, the associated sub-sections and section 23D will be looked at in this context and in the light of available resources.</P>

	<P>General practitioners who participate in out of hours co-operatives do not seek any payment from medical card patients for services delivered under the general medical services scheme whether it is delivered at a treatment centre or in a domiciliary setting. However, consultation charges which may be sought from private patients who attend for treatment or to whom domiciliary service is given by the participating general practitioners are a matter of private contract between the two parties concerned, the doctor as the service provider and the patient as the service user. As the Health Service Executive now has the responsibility to deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf personal and social services for eligible persons, my Department has referred the matter to the chief officer of the executive&rsquo;s north-eastern area for investigation and direct reply.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the cost of nursing care in St. Joseph&rsquo;s centre, St. John of God&rsquo;s Nursing Home, Crinken Lane, Shankill, which provides specific care for people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, has increased by nearly 30% within the past year; if he accepts that this increase is putting nursing home care out of the reach of individuals and families alike; and the additional support available for people in this situation.</Quest>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, St. Joseph&rsquo;s is a private facility offering nursing care to individuals, many of whom suffer from terminal dementia. As the placement of an individual in a private nursing home is a private matter between the patient or his or her representative and the nursing home, my Department has no say in the fees charged by the home.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its <Col N="1764"/>behalf health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of long-term care services in the Shankill area.

At that time the numbers employed in the speech and language therapy grades in each Health Service Executive area are described in the following table with all figures expressed in whole time equivalent terms.

        <QRef>[12415/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The most recent figures from the commission indicate that there are now in excess of 140,000 broadband customers, which is almost 9% market penetration as measured on the basis of fixed telephone lines. For comparison, the January 2004 figure was 35,000.</P>
        <P>According to the ComReg website <i>www.comreg.ie</i> there are over 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies, including DSL, fibre, cable, leased lines and satellite technology. In essence, there are broadband technologies that can deliver broadband to any broadband customer in Ireland right now. There are now over 130 companies listed by ComReg as Internet service providers.</P>
        <P>Costs for broadband in Ireland compare favourably with the EU average; competition in the market is an operational matter for the regulator.</P>
        <P>The rate of uptake is dependent on access by the service providers to suitable infrastructure. Because the level of investment by the sector in high-speed broadband infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the demand for broadband, my Department is addressing the infrastructure deficit, in co-operation with the local and regional authorities, by building high-speed open access fibre-based metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, using ERDF and Government funding under the NDP 2000-2006. Full details of my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme can be found on <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The percentage of telephone lines which are suitable for DSL is an operational matter for Eircom and the regulator, and I have no function in the matter. I understand, however, that Eircom plans to extend DSL broadband access to 90% of the country by March 2006. I have set the industry a target of 500,000 broadband customers by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007. That means a market penetration of around 14% of the overall population, which I feel is within reach.</P>

	<P>The MANs programme is being rolled out on a phased basis, and the 19 networks completed to date have come in on time and within budget. Work is currently under way on seven MANs, and construction of a further 82 will commence during the next 12  months.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.9-?>
        <P>Under the county and group broadband scheme, smaller towns and rural communities can avail of grant funding of up to 55% of set-up costs to enable them to become self-sufficient in broadband, using the most suitable technology for their area. The objective of the county and group broadband scheme is to promote the roll-out of broadband access through the establishment of sustainable broadband services in towns, villages, rural hinterlands and under-served areas of larger towns on the basis of local and regional authority co-ordination and community driven initiatives. The scheme is open to all smaller and rural communities of less than 1,500 people. It enables local communities to draw up and implement their own broadband plans either on their own, or in partnership with broadband Internet service providers. A total of 34 group schemes have been approved to date.</P>
        <P>Under the &euro;18 million schools broadband access programme, jointly funded by the Department of Education and Science, my Department, and the Telecommunications and Internet Federation, every one of the 4,200 primary and post-primary schools in the country will be provided with broadband by the end of this year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 196 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Government has not yet taken a decision on the timing of the referendum on the European constitution. It will be held either later this year or next year, to allow for the completion in good time of the ratification process by the target date of 1 November 2006. The necessary preparations are under way. Specifically, the Bill amending the Irish Constitution will be initiated in this House in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>There is no point in engaging in hypothetical discussion of the possible outcomes or consequences of referendums in Ireland or elsewhere. Ratification of the European constitution is for each member state in accordance with its own arrangements and the Government would not presume to advise others on how to proceed. In its approach to the ratification of the European Constitution by Ireland, the Government will in all circumstances continue to be guided by the national interest.</P>
        <P>While I do not accept the premise which appears to underlie Question No. 196, I reiterate that Ireland&rsquo;s position on decision-making regarding taxation is firm and unambiguous, is shared by several other member states, and is fully protected both in the European constitution and in the existing treaties.</P>

	<P>The incident to which the Deputy refers has been raised through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast. The British Government has informed us that the incident in question involved a number of youths who climbed through a gap in the fence of Hazelwood school and then threw stones into Old Throne Park. The police came to the scene and noted the details of several individuals. These names have been forwarded to the youth diversion officer. The British side informed us that no damage to property was recorded. The Government has been assured that the school has been secured and the PSNI is endeavouring to find a resolution of the ongoing difficulties in this area, which have stretched over the past number of years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government consistently raises its concerns at sectarian attacks through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast, at the regular meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference and at the frequent meetings between senior Ministers on both sides. At official level, we recently discussed incidents in Larne, Belfast and Derry with the authorities in Northern Ireland, with a view to ensuring every effort is made to prevent further incidents of this nature. The eradication of sectarianism is an important policy aim of the Government. In the declaration of support contained in the Good Friday Agreement, the Government committed itself, along <Col N="1779"/>with all the other parties, to the achievement of &ldquo;reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all&rdquo;. This objective is given practical expression by our support for the International Fund for Ireland, and also the work of the Government&rsquo;s reconciliation fund, which aims to assist organisations involved in reconciliation work and which has awarded grants exceeding &euro;15.1 million to more than 480 organisations between 1999 and 2004. The Government also strongly supports community-based policing in Northern Ireland as the key to the creation of a safer society where the fear of sectarian and paramilitary attacks would become a thing of the past. It has closely monitored the implementation of the Patten recommendations in close liaison with the Oversight Commissioner for Policing, Mr. Al Hutchinson.</P>

	<P>The Czech authorities have confirmed that Irish citizens have only to present a valid travel document when entering the Czech Republic and that there is no restriction regarding the length of validity of the passport. This change has been in place since the 1 May 2004 and is in line with the requirements of other EU states.</P>

	<P>The State agencies operating in Irish diplomatic missions are listed in the following table. The total operational costs given are for the year 2004 and include chancery costs. The State agencies' share of this cost is provided. Operational costs are taken to mean rent, rates, heating, lighting, cleaning, common charges, etc. It does not include salary, telephone or information technology equipment costs. However, in some instances only the rent costs are available with such short notice. It is the policy of my Department to contact State agencies when embassies are being established in new locations to ascertain their interest in participating in an Ireland House project in these new locations.</P><Col N="1779"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>There are six Irish Embassies in Europe with a staffing contingent made up of an ambassador, a first secretary, a third secretary and support staff. These embassies are located in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey. The average operating cost for these missions in 2004 was &euro;1,002,966.90. Expenditure incurred during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union from 1 January to 30 June 2004 is included in the figure provided. In December 2004, the Government approved the opening of resident missions in Malta, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Romania and Vietnam. It is intended that these new missions will be opened in the second half of this year. The opening of new Irish missions is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As the Deputy will appreciate, however, <Col N="1784"/>constraints on Government expenditure, and the limits on the resources that can be made available, require that the expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and must be based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved.</P>

This is the circular strip of lighting that surrounds the roof of the leisure waters, and Rohcon has confirmed that it is to be installed on top of the flume tower from 23 May to 10 June 2005.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government would welcome a debate about the proposed directive, on which discussions are continuing in the Council working group and in the European Parliament. My Department gave a presentation on the draft directive to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on 5 March, but the views of all Deputies on this important proposal would be particularly welcome.</P>
        <P>My Department has been, and is, engaged in widespread and detailed consultation with other Departments and with interested parties to make an effective input to the discussions. Advertisements were placed in the media last year seeking written submissions from service users and producers who would potentially be affected by the directive. The Department also wrote to approxi<Col N="1787"/>mately 50 stakeholder organisations last year informing them of the existence of the draft directive and seeking their comments on it. We repeated the invitation late last year, when we informed the same organisations that the Department had dedicated a part of its website, at <i>www.entemp.ie</i>, to the draft directive. My Department has had discussions with the social partners about the draft directive and expects to have further discussions with them.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with all other member states of the EU, is very supportive of the objective of the proposed directive, which is to create a genuine Single Market in services throughout the EU. However, like all member states, we have concerns about many aspects of the current proposal, which is a long way from being adopted.</P>
        <P>Services account, in the EU, for up to 70% of GNP and employment, and the creation of a genuine European Single Market would yield enormous benefits for the European &mdash; and Irish &mdash; services sectors. It would also be a big plus for consumers, in Ireland and throughout the European Union. It is clear that where competition and more suppliers are introduced into an economic sector, consumers benefit.</P>

	<P>I do not consider that my replies of 24 February need to be amended, as the investigation of the labour inspectorate into a particular company in the construction sector was ongoing. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did not receive the report of the labour inspectorate until 6 April.</P>
        <P>Since the Minister received the report he has been active with the management of the company and the workers, and has kept the Oireachtas abreast of developments.</P>
        <P>An additional 11 staff for the labour inspectorate have been announced. They will place a specific emphasis on sectors where migrant workers are concentrated. This significant increase, 50%, will allow the inspectorate to do a great deal more of what it does best &mdash; ensuring compliance with the law and ensuring workers get their entitlements. Additional staff are appointed to the labour inspectorate on foot of developments in the workplace. With the introduction of the national minimum wage in 1997, the existing ten <Col N="1788"/>labour inspectors were augmented by a further seven. Subsequently, the grade level of the inspectors was increased from clerical officer to executive officer. A further four inspectors were appointed on foot of the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress last June, and, as I have said, an additional 11 inspectors will be appointed. As the House can see, those increases in resources are in direct response to identified needs and interaction with the social partners.</P>
        <P>Arising from the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress agreed by all parties in June 2004, the inspectorate was asked to draw up a discussion document on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate for the social partnership process. The discussion document is not prescriptive; rather it seeks to present the arguments for and against an extensive range of issues impacting on the mandate and associated resourcing of the labour inspectorate and its linked business units. A spectrum of possible models for compliance checking and enforcement have been identified and were presented for discussion. The purpose of their inclusion is primarily to stimulate debate and signal that fundamental changes in approach should be considered. Some views have been received from the social partners, while others are awaited.</P>

The pay rates currently applicable for an adult worker range from &euro;7.51 to &euro;8.08 per hour.

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Support for job creation and investment on a regional or local basis comes within the remit of the industrial development agency IDA Ireland, which is actively marketing individual areas as a location for additional foreign direct investment, and Enterprise Ireland, which is concentrating on the development of indigenous industries, with the 35 city and county enterprise boards, or CEBs, having primary responsibility for the regional promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector. Under the Industrial Development Acts, I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, but I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>The development agencies have assured me that they are working to secure additional investment and jobs for the people of South Tipperary, including those living in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>While the IDA has not hosted any recent site visits by prospective investors to Carrick-on-Suir, there have been 11 such visits to the surrounding area in the past 12 months. The IDA is currently supporting two overseas companies in Carrick-on-Suir. While they are also promoting the town for additional overseas investment through their network of overseas offices, their experience of dealing with clients looking at Ireland is that many companies will only consider larger urban centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment. Ultimately, it is the investor who decides where to locate a project, including what areas to visit as potential locations.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s response to this experience in the South Tipperary-Waterford area has been to concentrate the main focus of its marketing campaign on the gateway location of Waterford and the county town of Clonmel. It is doing so to maximise the number of overseas companies that can be attracted to the area and to avail of the knock-on benefits in other sectors such as supply, distribution and transport, thus creating further investment and employment opportunities for local people in the immediate vicinity and surrounding areas.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the agency that it believes Carrick-on-Suir can benefit from that strategy, given its close proximity to both Waterford and Clonmel. The announcement in May 2004 by Guidant Corporation of a 1,000-person job expansion at its Clonmel plant should have considerable knock-on benefits in other investment and employment opportunities for people in the <Col N="1790"/>immediate vicinity and surrounding areas, including those living in Carrick-on-Suir.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has a five-acre site in Carrick-on-Suir, and discussions are ongoing with South Tipperary County Council regarding the development of the site to help generate economic activity in the town.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment in 1993, Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Board has provided over &euro;448,000 in financial aid to 40 projects in the Carrick-on-Suir area, which in turn has assisted in the creation of 67 full-time jobs. The board has run management development courses and targeted training courses on starting one&rsquo;s own business, web design, front office skills and IT training in Carrick-on-Suir town. Over 110 people have been directly trained on those programmes. While the majority of current training programmes are organised in Clonmel, a significant number of businesses availing of those programmes come from the Carrick-on-Suir area.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is actively involved in addressing industrial development in Tipperary South through the county development board and through working closely with the other development agencies in the county, including IDA, F&Aacute;S, and the county enterprise board. In addition to direct finance, Enterprise Ireland has a range of service offerings to encourage high-technology, high-opportunity indigenous enterprise to get off the ground. Key support areas include project-building, mentoring, training, space, patent protection advice and business angels.</P>
        <P>Specific State support to facilitate those who are unemployed to join or re-enter the labour force is provided by F&Aacute;S, the national training and employment authority. F&Aacute;S offers skills analysis, training and retraining programmes and a job placement service for those who are unemployed and is sponsoring a jobs club in the enterprise centre in Carrick-on-Suir. That last initiative is aimed at increasing the skills levels of those concerned. The agency also works closely with the Carrick-on-Suir RAPID steering committee. RAPID is a special designation project for areas of high deprivation aimed at establishing innovative actions that aid growth and social and economic inclusion in the designated areas.</P>
        <P>In addition, I would like to point out that the numbers on the live register in the Carrick-on-Suir area fell from 971 in February 2004 to 910 in February 2005, which reflects a positive trend.</P>
        <P>I welcome the initiative of the Tipperary South county manager last October in setting up a local working group to deal with unemployment issues in Carrick-on-Suir and to prepare a development plan for the area under the auspices of the county development board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The small and medium sized enterprise sector is supported and encouraged by the Government&rsquo;s active and constant pursuit and promotion of an economic environment that is supportive of entrepreneurial activity, combined with a wide range of targeted interventions by various State enterprise development agencies. The strong focus of many of the interventions, particularly those involving financial support, on businesses in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector reflects the key importance that the sector plays in building Irish economic growth, as well as concerns about the strong risks of deadweight and displacement that are a particular concern in the non-traded services sector. It is not appropriate to give financial aid to a local service in circumstances in which the increased activity arising from the support is likely to be achieved at the expense of other similar businesses in the locality.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s extraordinary success in the past decade has been and continues to be built on key competitive strengths, such as one of the lowest taxation regimes in Europe, access to the EU internal market, a well-educated and skilled workforce and a history of Government policies that are pro-business and provide a benign business environment. The Government is committed to the continued support and development of such strengths. It appears that the actions being taken are achieving the objective of ensuring that we have an environment in which small and medium sized enterprises can flourish. The global entrepreneurship monitor report for 2004, which is the premier cross-national assessment of entrepreneurship, shows that Ireland is performing extremely well in terms of entrepreneurship activity. It is in second position overall in terms of total entrepreneurial activity among all EU member states.</P>

	<P>I reiterate that the decision to provide support to a particular company is an <Col N="1796"/>administrative matter for the agency concerned and not one in which I have a direct function.</P>
        <P>The 140 Enterprise Ireland supported companies mentioned in my previous reply are located in east Cork. As the Forf&aacute;s employment survey for 2004 has now become available, I can provide the most recent data. In 2004, there were 13 Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Cobh, while there were seven Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Youghal. For purposes of clarity, only companies in the Cobh and Youghal urban districts have been included in the figures, which exclude nearby towns such as Carrigtwohill and Midleton, in the case of Cobh, and Castlemartyr, Shanagarry and Ballymacoda, in the case of Youghal.</P>
        <P>In 2004, Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Youghal were approved assistance of &euro;27,400 and such supported companies in Cobh were approved assistance of &euro;5,500. Overall approvals for Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in Cobh and Youghal from 2002 to 2004 amounted to &euro;257,462. Payment for the same period to Enterprise Ireland assisted companies in Cobh and Youghal amounted to &euro;503,059. Grant approval is spread over a variety of projects, including capital, research and development, feasibility and management. Employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Cobh for 2004 was 287, representing a slight increase over the 2003 figure of 278. Employment figures in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Youghal showed a slight decrease from 90 in 2003 to 85 in 2004.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to all regions and areas of Ireland. While I may give general policy directives to IDA Ireland, I am precluded under legislation from giving directives about individual undertakings or giving preference to one area over others. As I stated in my reply of 16 December last, I understand from IDA Ireland that Cobh and Youghal are marketed by IDA Ireland&rsquo;s south-west region as part of the broader east Cork area, which also includes locations such as Little Island, Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Carrigaline and Ringaskiddy. IDA Ireland is promoting east Cork to potential investors on an ongoing basis. Every <Col N="1797"/>effort is being made to secure further advanced knowledge-based industry for the east Cork area.</P>
        <P>Due to their proximity to the greater Cork area, Cobh and Youghal also benefit from continued development from an inward investment perspective. There are 134 IDA Ireland assisted companies in County Cork, employing approximately 18,000 people. Between 2002 and 2004, 50% of all jobs announced in Cork came from companies locating in the broader east Cork area, thereby making the area the prime beneficiary from inward investment in the south-west region. In Cork, as elsewhere, there is a need to mobilise initiatives and resources on a regional rather than on a purely local basis, to compete effectively with other strong regions, cities and countries. In this context we must not forget that the investor ultimately decides where to locate. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland, along with the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to regional development, will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs in this region.</P>

	<P>Some 200 people, including 20 participants from Youghal and Cobh, participated in training programmes organised by the south Cork county enterprise board in 2003 and 2004. The board operates clinics every month in Youghal and Cobh. The training and other soft supports provided to micro-enterprises by the county enterprise boards are designed to assist new and existing enterprises in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations, through the development and improvement of a range of business skills. While such support contributes positively to the long-term growth and sustainability of the enterprises, it is not possible directly to relate participation in training and mentoring initiatives to the creation of new jobs. The number of jobs in enterprises supported by the south Cork county enterprise board, in the form of financial assistance or soft supports, has increased by 32 since 2003.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 230 together.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for attracting foreign direct investment to all regions and areas of Ireland. Under the Industrial Development Acts, I may give general policy directives to the agency but I am precluded from giving directives about individual undertakings or giving preference to one area over others. One of the agency&rsquo;s major objectives is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this objective through the prioritisation of development and investment in the locations which have been identified as gateways and hubs.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for County Kerry is to achieve developments in the international services and ICT sectors, focusing on the designated linked hubs of Tralee and Killarney. While targeting potential new projects, the agency is working with its existing portfolio of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities. While employment levels in assisted companies in Tralee and the county as a whole have decreased since 2003, foreign direct investment companies are performing relatively well when considered in the context of the recent global downturn and the effects of the events of 11 September 2001, which resulted in fewer companies actively seeking to invest overseas.</P>
        <P>The regrettable demise of companies such as Sports Socks and Imperial Schrade resulted mainly from the fact that Ireland is less competitive for basic manufacturing operations. County Kerry and all other parts of Ireland must gear themselves to attracting a different type of investor. The focus for the future must be on attracting investment that requires high skill levels and is more orientated towards innovation than production. Job creation and job losses are a feature of economic development in all countries, as various sectors expand and contract in response to market demand for goods and services, competitive forces, restructuring and technological change. While the transition to a high-skill high-technology regional economy will take time to <Col N="1799"/>achieve, I am pleased that three new projects were announced in Kerry in 2004.</P>
        <P>Dollinger (Ireland) Limited, which has been established in Killarney for over 20 years, is to be the global centre for the production of its compressed air products range. The company will have global responsibility for the development of such products. The investment of &euro;1.1 million, which will create more than 70 new jobs over the next four years, has resulted in the relocation of the company to larger premises in the town&rsquo;s IDA business park.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Liebherr Container Cranes Limited, which has been in Killarney for 46 years and is one of the longest established IDA supported companies in Ireland, intends to recruit six highly skilled research and development personnel for a new specialised team. The team, which will be of strategic importance to the parent company and will enhance the facility&rsquo;s role as the centre of control for Liebherr&rsquo;s container crane products, will develop products from concept to product launch. Any intellectual property developed will be the property of the Irish company.</P>
        <P>Fujisawa, one of the world&rsquo;s top 30 pharmaceutical companies, announced that it had invested &euro;17 million in the expansion of its Irish operation, Fujisawa Ireland Limited, in Killorglin, County Kerry. The company has a total employment of 280 people and has constructed a 27,000 sq. ft. extension to provide additional production space for the new operation.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
        <P>Due to a heavy schedule of departmental and parliamentary business, I cannot give a specific commitment at this time to visit County Kerry or <Col N="1800"/>to meet the local Chamber of Commerce. I intend to include in my program a visit to the county in the near future. I would be more than happy to meet the chamber and any other interested parties at that time.</P>

	<P>The management of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial property portfolio is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency. I do not have a direct function in that regard. From inquiries I have made of the agency, I understand that IDA Ireland&rsquo;s lands at Castledermot &mdash; approximately 1.39 hectares, Monasterevin &mdash; approximately 2.5 hectares and Kildare town &mdash; approxi<Col N="1800"/>mately 4.6 hectares, were approved for disposal by IDA Ireland to Kildare County Council in April 2003. The transaction was approved on the basis that the council would use the land for the requirements of Enterprise Ireland and county enterprise board projects, and to encourage other industrial development activities. The disposal of the land to the council would allow the land to be available for a range of activities outside the remit of IDA Ireland. The transaction has not yet been finalised. As discussions are ongoing between the agency and the council, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further about the matter. While the lands remain in IDA ownership, they are available for qualifying industrial activities.</P>

	<P>Following my recent announcement on 12 April there are now 31 labour inspector posts. Immediate steps have been taken to source the new inspectors initially from within the existing staff complement of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment. Accordingly, I expect early appointments.</P>
        <P>Pending these new appointments, there are 17.5 labour inspectors in the inspectorate. One inspector is currently on long-term sick leave and one job-sharing inspector is on extended unpaid leave. A further two inspectors are currently engaged in assisting the Employment Appeals Tribunal to process a backlog of cases.</P>
        <P>A number of other officials at team leader and management grades within the employment rights compliance section are warranted as inspectors and perform such duties as required. The labour inspectors are supported by six administrative staff and the inspectorate makes up just one part of the employment rights compliance section, the other elements being the employment rights information unit and the employment rights prosecution and enforcement section.</P>
        <P>Neither our employment rights legislation nor the inspectorate makes any distinction between the employment rights of workers on the basis of nationality.</P>

	<P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. Inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is <Col N="1802"/>found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to native Irish workers. I have recently announced a 50% increase in the numbers of labour inspectors and have directed that these additional officers focus particularly on the sectors where non-EEA employees are most numerous.</P>
        <P>In addition, where employers seek work permits in order to employ non-EEA nationals, the Department requires the statement of the main functions of the job, salary-wages, deductions, other than statutory, other benefits and hours to be worked per week. Both the proposed employer and the proposed employee must sign this statement. Work permits are not granted unless there is compliance with minimum wages legislation. Applications for renewals require confirmation that the stated wages have been paid; P60 and other sources are used. If there is evidence that particular employers are exploiting immigrant workers I would ask that it be brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate for investigation and further action.</P>

	<P>Employment data is not provided in a format that differentiates between types of employment or salary levels.</P>
        <P>In the past few years, conditions in the global economy have been difficult, and Irish firms have had to win business against a backdrop of difficult external demand conditions, pricing pressures and an increasingly competitive international environment. These factors have affected employment trends in companies assisted by the enterprise development agencies. While the net increase in employment in agency-assisted companies in 2000 was 24,000 jobs, subsequent years have shown a net fall off in the numbers employed in such companies. However, employment in these companies is still one third higher than it was a decade ago. This is a strong performance in the context of global economic circumstances. </P><Col N="1801"/>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">There are now indications that economic prospects are improving and our propensity to capitalise on trends in global growth is likely again to stimulate business expansion and real employment growth. The ESRI has indicated that labour market conditions are expected to remain strong both this year and next, with unemployment stabilising to average 4.3% in both 2005 and 2006, supported by significant growth in GNP. In light of the intense global competitive pressures, these forecasts show that our economy maintains considerable strengths.</P>
        <P>We have become a more sophisticated and developed economy where the application of technology and intellectual endeavour is becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for growth and prosperity. To counterbalance the competitive threat from lower wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value added products and services because these types of enterprise create high-skill employment. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy.</P>
        <P>The enterprise development agencies are working to source new investment by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. Given the critical mass of FDI in Ireland and its linkages with indigenous companies, one of the greatest potential contributions will come from developing companies already operating here. The enterprise development agencies are working to encourage companies into more sophisticated activities where competitive advantage is less likely to be whittled away by cost based competition.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236 and 237 together.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council in its annual competitiveness report 2004 mentioned the issue of insurance costs in Ireland. The NCC&rsquo;s commentary was based on data published by Swiss Re sigma. This information, based on 2003 figures, depicts insurance premiums <i>per capita</i> for non-life insurance for 16 countries and includes both motor and public liability insurance. It should be noted that this information covers expenditure on insurance, which is only a proxy for the relative price of similar insurance services in different countries. It cannot be seen as a definitive competitiveness barometer for insurance costs.</P>
        <P>Of the 16 countries surveyed, Ireland&rsquo;s expenditure on non-life insurance was the fifth highest with a value of $1, 356. Switzerland was the highest with a value of $2,228, the United States were second highest with a value of $1,980, the Netherlands were third with a value of $1,532. The United Kingdom with a value of $1,441 was fourth highest. Hungary was the second lowest with a value of $148, whilst Poland was the cheapest with a value of $102. The average expenditure for the EU15 was $974 and the OECD&rsquo;s average was $1,008.</P>
        <P>However, these figures need to be analysed carefully as they do not always include only or all premiums paid by the inhabitants of the country concerned. The NCC also reported that the use of a tort system in Ireland increases private premiums <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> Europe and the USA where the use of a no-fault system reduces the level of expenditure on insurance premiums.</P>
        <P>Recent experience in Ireland indicates that the cost of insurance is falling as a result of the Government&rsquo;s insurance reform programme. The CSO publishes monthly indices of costs for a number of classes of insurance. These statistics show that there was a reduction of 20% in motor car insurance between the months of April 2002, when the first Motor Insurance Advisory Board report was published, and October 2004. There <Col N="1805"/>are also reported reductions in the cost of premia for public and employer liability insurance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 240 together.</P>
        <P>The National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s annual competitiveness report for 2004 ranks Ireland second only to Singapore in terms of exports of goods and services in 2003 as a percentage of GDP. Given the fact that Ireland is obviously one of the world&rsquo;s most open economies, firms must be competitive to succeed both in the domestic market and in international markets. Firms operating here have been adversely affected by a rise in the cost of goods and services, wages and business costs in recent years. However, there are many different factors which contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness other than just prices and costs. A competitive taxation regime, a highly educated and flexible workforce, low levels of business regulation, access to European markets as well as a transition towards higher end value products and services all combine to create a positive and competitive business environment for exporting firms operating in Ireland.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Ireland&rsquo;s trading performance has been remarkable in recent times, as evidenced by the NCC&rsquo;s analysis. Exports constitute an increasing share of the economy&rsquo;s total output of goods and services. They make a substantial contribution to employment creation and maintenance and underpin a positive trade surplus position. Since the strong appreciation of the euro against both the US dollar and sterling, and given the fact that the USA and the UK are among Ireland&rsquo;s largest trading partners, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has been significantly affected. Despite this, Ireland&rsquo;s trade remains strong with the most recent CSO external trade 2004 figures showing that total merchandise exports for 2004 were worth &euro;83.9 billion, an increase of 2% on the 2003 figures.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>We are no longer a low cost economy and as such our future competitiveness and prosperity is <Col N="1806"/>dependent upon our ability to move further up the value chain and become an innovative knowledge intensive economy. Enterprise policy is being actively refocused towards creating the conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skill, knowledge-intensive activities and in which advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to growth and employment. These are essential if our enterprises are to capture sustainable competitive advantage in niche markets that are less susceptible to cost-based competition. The range of incentives provided through the enterprise development agencies are designed to meet these objectives and to help enterprise operate at higher levels of skill, undertake higher order strategic investments, product development and innovation. The agencies want to be active and supportive partners with enterprise in helping new market oriented investment projects.</P>
        <P>The Government recognised the need to develop a high value-added knowledge intensive economy when it established the enterprise strategy group. The ESG&rsquo;s report Ahead of the Curve is pivotal in mapping the future direction of Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise policy and ensuring our competitiveness. The purpose of the ESG is to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s enterprise sector is able to build on its strengths and to exploit new opportunities in technology and services. The Government is committed to implementing the key recommendations contained in this report to maintain the competitiveness of our enterprise economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s economy is undergoing fundamental change, which is affecting all sectors of our economy. Ireland can no longer be seen as a low cost location for investment as our strengths and competitive advantages have inexorably changed. High output and productivity together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards now typify Ireland&rsquo;s economy. Ireland is no longer seen as a location for what could be called basic low-tech production and is being overtaken by low wage economies in terms of cost competitiveness. However, no measure is available to quantify jobs that may have relocated to other countries. Naturally, a more attractive cost environment abroad will inevitably entice some firms that are unable to generate their required return from the modern enterprise economy into which we have transformed ourselves. A continuing structural evolution of our economy is both unavoidable and necessary to maintain current levels of growth and low unemployment. With this, some plant transfers and other adjustments are bound to come but where relocation has occurred to date, it has largely been limited to relatively low-technology, labour-intensive activities.</P>
        <P>We have become a more sophisticated and developed economy where the application of technology and intellectual endeavour is becoming more important than simple cost competitiveness as the foundation for growth and prosperity. We now have one of the most open economies in the world where trends in world trade, global business investment and consumer decisions directly influence the pattern of economic growth, company development and job prospects here more so than probably in other developed economies.</P>
        <P>A balanced combination of pro-enterprise policies has helped propel economic growth and employment expansion and these have encour<Col N="1808"/>aged deeper and stronger links to both the enlarging EU markets and internationally. Consequently, Irish enterprise and society has benefited enormously from the ability of entrepreneurs to operate more profitably both in and from Ireland.</P>
        <P>To counterbalance the competitive threat from lower wage competitor economies, our policy is to encourage a move to higher levels of productivity and value added products and services. Sustainable employment will be driven by companies with higher profitability that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and are therefore less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. This new investment will be sourced by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors. The enterprise development agencies have a clear mandate to align their operations around this policy objective.</P>
        <P>The latest data from the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s quarterly national household survey in respect of Quarter 4 2004 shows that employment increased by 65,200 on the corresponding period in 2003, bringing the total number in employment to a record 1,894,100. This is a remarkable achievement at a time when there is considerable debate and comment about the impact of competition from lower wage economies on employment levels in developed economies.</P>

All four appointees are employed full-time.</P>

        <P>Payments towards the cost of these services would not come within the scope of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally.

The increased funding will provide scope for the 34 community transport groups being funded under the scheme <Col N="1813"/>to undertake a modest expansion of services, as envisaged in the 2004 evaluation of the RTI.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Limited, ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department and has sole responsibility for making specific allocations to individual project groups from funding provided by my Department.

In making such allocations, I have called on ADM to work closely with the groups to maximise the impact of the increased funding and to ensure continued value for money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to develop a metro for Dublin with a link to Dublin Airport. The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department a detailed business case for a metro from the city centre to Dublin Airport while Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann submitted proposals last July for an integrated rail network in the greater Dublin area. While the RPA has suggested a number of routes for the proposed metro, a final decision will be subject to a Government decision on the project and subsequently to the findings of a public inquiry as part of the statutory approval process. A further link from the airport to Swords is also being examined by the RPA.</P>
        <P>In the light of the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of agreement in principle to a ten-year capital investment envelope for transport, work has commenced in my Department on a ten-year transport investment plan. The draft framework takes account of the work already done on investment priorities under the current capital envelope to end 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies. The studies include A Platform for Change, the Strategic Rail Review and the National Road Needs Study. More specifically, my Department has engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office to identify the broad direction and priorities under the ten-year investment framework. My <Col N="1816"/>Department has also consulted with other Departments, primarily through the interdepartmental team of officials which supports the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, housing and public private partnerships.</P>
        <P>A draft of the ten-year transport plan is under consideration by the Cabinet committee. I will bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet committee has concluded its work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, in accordance with the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004, the three airport authorities at Dublin, Shannon and Cork are required to prepare comprehensive business plans. This work is ongoing. The position of the principal subsidiaries of the Dublin Airport Authority, including the Great Southern Hotels Group, must be considered by the authority in the first instance. The board&rsquo;s proposals for the future of the hotel group will be considered by me and the Minister for Finance in due course and in the context of the overall business planning process.</P>

	<P>Area Development Management Limited is administering and managing the taxi hardship payments <Col N="1817"/>scheme which is implementing the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. Payments under the scheme do not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship. The processing and consideration of applications under the scheme is being undertaken by ADM independently of my Department.</P>
        <P>While my Department has no details of individual applications made to ADM under the scheme, I understand from enquiries that no application from the person in question was received by ADM under the scheme which is now closed for applications.

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Sligo must have two herd tests; if this person&rsquo;s herd test will be scheduled for the last week in August in order that the results and documentation from this herd can be used for the September special animal sales; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the level of TB and brucellosis in Ireland, all herds are required by EU Directive 64/432/EEC to have one annual test for TB and brucellosis in order to maintain official free status and dependent trading opportunities. In order to facilitate the completion of the annual programme of tests and follow-up of disease detected, all such testing is conducted on an area, district electoral division, DED, basis and is organised into phases such that there is, as far a practicable, an even distribution of workload throughout the year, taking into consideration daylight, prevailing weather conditions and avail<Col N="1819"/>ability of private veterinary practitioners. The annual, round, herd test for the herdowner in question is due for completion in the course of the first phase, that is, before 12 June 2005. In this regard, I should point out that the annual herd test on his herd was carried out on 8 July in 2004 and on 10 May in 2003.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>Eligible animals being moved out of a herd must have passed a TB test within the previous 12 months and a brucellosis test within the previous 30 days. All farmers would like to have their herd tests scheduled at peak sales periods to avoid having to privately test animals they wish to sell, such as for special sales in the autumn. However it would be impossible to manage the testing programme if all herd tests were to be scheduled for this time period. It is therefore my policy not to reschedule the routine round tests out of their planned current phase unless there is a compelling disease reason to do so.</P>

The person named has been notified that the circumstances outlined by him do not satisfy the criteria for <i>force majeure</i> exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003.

	<P>Arrangements arrived at between landowners and the developers of the gas pipeline are not a matter for my Department in the first instance. My Department does, however, make special provision for cases in which, as a result of the development of the pipeline, participants in REPS are compelled to reduce the area they have included in the scheme. They are exempted from the general rule under which, if land included in a REPS plan is disposed of, payments already made on that area are recouped. Payments for the remainder of the REPS contract are, however, recalculated to reflect the reduced area.</P>

        <P>My Department is currently in the final stages of implementing the single payment scheme and the deadline for the receipt of applications is 16 May 2005. My primary objective is that payment should issue to farmers from the beginning of December 2005.

	<P>I wish to advise the House that <Col N="1825"/>Article 2.2 of the Council of Europe Convention states that:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">a person sentenced in the territory of a Party may be transferred to the territory of another Party, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, in order to serve the sentence imposed on him. To that end, he may express his interest to the sentencing State or to the administering State in being transferred under this Convention.</P>
        <P FLI="0">An expression of interest for transfer to a prison in this country from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in my Department on 23 August, 2004. In line with the convention, my Department wrote to the US Department of Justice on 24 August 2004, requesting that it should commence processing this individual&rsquo;s application. The US Department of Justice is the central contact point in respect of all international prison transfer applications between Ireland and the United States. My Department has had no correspondence with the Office of the Governor of Massachusetts as regards this matter and has not, as yet, received the formal application and supporting documentation from the United States authorities.</P>
        <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions in order to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents &mdash; assuming they will be forthcoming &mdash; an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 276 to 280, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>If a person who is the subject of a valid deportation order wishes to return to the State, he or she may apply to have the deportation order revoked under section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person from Romania must also hold a valid visa to travel to the State. There is no automatic right of residency for a non-national married to an Irish national and a person who marries an Irish national may apply for permission to enter and reside in the State with his or her Irish national spouse. It is the normal procedure where such an application is received from a person who is the subject of a deportation order and marries an Irish national outside the State, that both the revocation and the residency issues are considered at the same time.</P>
        <P>The person in question is the subject of a valid deportation order signed on 26 October 2000 following a failed asylum application in the State. He was deported on foot of this order in September 2003 and is obliged to remain outside the State. He married an Irish national in his home country in December 2003 and made an application for the revocation of the deportation order on 6 February 2004. Following consideration of the circumstances of the case this application was refused on 27 April 2004 and a notification issued to this effect.</P>
        <P>The person concerned can make a fresh application for the revocation of the deportation order and permission to enter and remain in the State <Col N="1827"/>based on marriage to an Irish national if there has been any change to his circumstances since 27 April 2004.</P>

	<P>The prisoner&rsquo;s request for a transfer to Shelton Abbey was discussed recently at a local review meeting in Wheatfield Prison and a transfer to an open centre was not recommended at this stage of his sentence. From my response to Question No. 498 of 22 March 2005, the person to whom the Deputy referred was approved a transfer, on a swap basis, to the Midlands Prison in early March 2005. The purpose of this transfer is to facilitate family visits. I understand from the Irish Prison Service that he will be transferred when the next opportunity arises to swap prisoners between both institutions.</P>

	<P>Entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is governed by the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations, 1988, as amended. These regulations provide that the Garda Commissioner shall not admit a person as a Garda trainee unless the person is certified by a registered medical practitioner to be in good health, of sound constitution and suited physically and mentally to performing the duties of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In the above regard I am informed by the Garda authorities that the vision standard required by Garda trainees is as follows: not less than 6/9, 6/12 unaided by glasses or contact lenses; binocular acuity for near vision should be N8 measured on Snellan test types; both eyes should be free of organic, congenital or traumatic lesions; have normal visual fields; have normal fundoscopy. The vision of the applicant referred to by the Deputy in the question was assessed by the medical examiners at the Garda medical department, who concluded that while his right eye met the required visual entry standard, his left eye was below the minimum acceptable visual entry standard set for entry to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the allocation and deployment of Garda personnel, that the number of Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.</P>
        <P>With regard to Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps.</P>
        <P>I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 296 and 297 together.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to grant an amnesty either as part of the Immigration and Residence Bill or as a separate part of an overall immigration reform package to those who are illegally in the State. For several years now we have been operating one of the most liberal economic migration systems in Europe, with large numbers entering the State legally for employment purposes. In addition, we are one of the few states in Europe to have granted full access to our labour market on enlargement of the EU to citizens of the new member states.</P>
        <P>Amnesties and regularisations, in my view, undermine the system of legal migration by rewarding those who have no legal basis for their residence in the country. Also, they reward those who abuse our asylum system. It is an integral element of any asylum system that those who are not in need of protection should be returned to their countries of origin.</P>
        <P>International experience is that amnesties have a &ldquo;sponge effect&rdquo;, that is, an attracting effect, which brings more illegals into the country to avail of them. Amnesties or regularisations are never once-off. They send out wrong signals by saying that there will be another amnesty or regularisation along soon, which in turn encourages more illegal immigration.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for individual states to determine whether they grant amnesties to persons who are illegally present in their jurisdictions. As the Minister charged with responsibility for the Irish immigration system, I would not support calls for such an amnesty in the Irish immigration system for the reasons outlined above.</P>

	<P>Part 10 of the Children Act 2001 relates to the governance and operation of children detention schools. Section 159(1) of the Act has been developed for the purpose of allowing three representatives of children detention schools to be appointed to the special residential services board. Part 10 of the Act cannot be developed more fully at this time as its effect will include replacing the existing industrial and reformatory schools with children detention schools. While boys aged between 17 and 21 who are convicted of a criminal offence may be sent to a place of <Col N="1840"/>detention, there is no equivalent place at present for female offenders who may be imprisoned from the age of 17 years. It is intended that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will provide a facility for young women similar to that provided for boys.</P>
        <P>However, until such a facility becomes available, part 10 of the Act cannot be brought into law. Pending commencement, industrial and reformatory schools continue to be governed by the Children Acts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. Circular SP ED 09/04, which was issued to schools in June 2004, introduced the model.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows. It facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; and it will automatically adjust a school&rsquo;s general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</P>
        <P>This is a model for resource allocation to schools. These resources may in turn be allocated, as appropriate by schools to those pupils with special educational needs in the categories mentioned and to pupils with learning support requirements. While I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the <Col N="1841"/>model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced. For this reason I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level and further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.</P>
        <P>Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department&rsquo;s student maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance may not generally be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. However, the awarding body may waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness. It should be emphasised, however, that this discretion would only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.</P>
        <P>My Department understands from officials at County Sligo VEC, the body responsible for the assessment of the candidate referred to by the Deputy, that he previously attended years one and two of a certificate in computer aided precision engineering at Sligo Institute of Technology in the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 academic years. The institute confirmed that the candidate did not return to the second year of the course after the first term in January 2000. The candidate in question is, in fact, pursuing a different course at Sligo IT in the 2004-05 academic year, which is the higher certificate in mechatronics.</P>
        <P>My Department understands from officials at County Sligo VEC that the issue of illness in the 1999-2000 academic year was raised for the first time with them through the Deputy&rsquo;s recent representations to the VEC. A letter from the student health services at Sligo IT regarding the period concerned was submitted. This does not provide the medical evidence required to justify consideration under the exceptional circumstances provision of the schemes. In any case, as already outlined, the candidate is pursuing a different course.</P>
        <P>While the candidate is not eligible for grant assistance for current course, he may be con<Col N="1842"/>sidered again in the future in the event that he progresses into year two, or, the &ldquo;add-on&rdquo; year, of an approved ordinary degree, formerly known as diploma, which is directly related to his current course, or an honours degree course, subject to the usual conditions of the schemes. Apart from the funding provided through the student support maintenance grant schemes, financial assistance is also available from my Department through the student assistance fund which is administered by the national office for equity of access to third level education. The objective of the fund, which is ESF-aided, is to assist students who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Further information on this fund is available from the student access officer at Sligo IT.</P>
        <P>A response to this effect will soon be issued directly to the candidate&rsquo;s mother who has written to me in the matter.</P>

	<P>The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department for site acquisitions generally, has identified a site which could provide for the long-term accommodation needs of the school referred to by the Deputy. Negotiations are ongoing regarding the acquisition of this site. However, the building of a new school on a greenfield site is only one option being considered by my Department.</P>
        <P>A second option, which could offer a better value for money solution, is being examined as part of an overall review of the primary educational infrastructure in the area where the school is located. The purpose of this review is to ascertain the likely demand for pupil places in the medium to long term and to ensure that existing provision is maximised to meet this demand.</P>
        <P>This review, which will be completed as quickly as possible, will inform any future decision on how best to resolve the accommodation needs of the school in question.</P>

	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. Circular SP ED 09/04, which issued to schools in June 2004, introduced this new model.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into <Col N="1845"/>account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; and it will automatically adjust a school&rsquo;s general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</P>
        <P>This is a model for resource allocation to schools. These resources may in turn be allocated, as appropriate by schools to those pupils with special educational needs in the categories mentioned and to pupils with learning support requirements.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced.</P>
        <P>For this reason, I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>

	<P>My Department arranges teacher exchange schemes at post-primary, on a post-to-post basis, between Ireland and Germany and between Ireland and France. The purpose of these schemes is to improve the quality of the teaching of German and French in Irish schools. The exchanges take place either on the basis of a one term exchange or one year exchange. Applications for participation in the 2005-06 teacher exchange schemes are currently under consideration within my Department.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and four mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 130 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has one full-time resource teacher and the services of a learning support teacher.</P>
        <P>My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 140 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>As outlined in primary circular 19/02, an independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. Appeals must be submitted to: Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made, after the schedule for the 2005-06 school year has issued.</P>

These include proposals to widen the electorate for the higher education constituency and ancillary matters such as nomination procedures, franchise and registration of electors, and methods of voting and counting.</P>
        <P>At the request of the Taoiseach I have agreed to chair an informal all-party parliamentary group to establish the extent of cross-party agreement on the report&rsquo;s recommendations and to advance, with consensus, proposals for the implementation of Seanad reform. I have written to party leaders and am awaiting nominations for <Col N="1850"/>the informal all-party group, which I intend to convene shortly in order to advance the recommendations in a timely and inclusive manner.</P>

        <Quest>if local authorities have easier access to funds from his Department to construct new local authority houses rather than to repair existing vacant houses; his views on whether there is a major problem involving the repair and allocation of existing vacant local authority houses and that if all vacant local authority houses were allocated, the nationwide housing crisis would improve; the distribution method of funds in the case of both existing and new local authority houses to local authorities; if his Department will review this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>It is the responsibility of the local authorities concerned to ensure that their houses are re-let to households on their waiting lists as quickly as possible after they are vacated. Some houses may require refurbishment before they are re-let and this is a matter for individual authorities. My Department provides capital funding, subject to conditions, to local authorities for the refurbishment of houses that have remained vacant for periods longer than six months and require major refurbishment. Local authorities are required to meet from their own resources the first &euro;10,000 of the cost of such refurbishment in respect of each dwelling.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the measures he has put in place to calculate the levels of environmental emission that have been generated here in order to ascertain the extent to which Ireland complies with its obligations under the Kyoto agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the preparation of annual greenhouse gas inventories in accordance with guidelines from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. The year 2003 is the latest for which inventory data is currently available. The agency compiles much of the information on the basis of national activities data, such as energy balances and agriculture statistics, obtained from relevant Departments and their agencies, and the Central Statistics Office.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s target under the Kyoto Protocol is to limit the level of emissions in the period 2008-2012 to 13% above 1990 levels. The latest figures issued by the agency show that emissions in 2003 were approximately 25% above 1990 levels, down from 29% in 2002 and 31% in 2001. Emissions in 2004 are being calculated by the agency.</P>
        <P>A 2004 consultants&rsquo; report commissioned by the Departments with primary responsibility for <Col N="1854"/>the development and implementation of national policy on climate change, concluded that greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 9.2 million tonnes per year in the period 2008 to 2012 in order to comply with the Kyoto Protocol target. A copy of the report is posted on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie. </i>The national climate change strategy provides a comprehensive framework for reducing Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions in the most efficient and equitable manner, and for ensuring that Ireland meets its commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The determination of waste management infrastructure requirements is primarily a matter for local authorities in the context of the relevant regional waste management plan. Facilities may be provided directly by the local authorities concerned or by private sector operators. Detailed information on such facilities is not maintained by my Department. My Department does, however, operate a waste management capital grants <Col N="1855"/>scheme under which local authorities may apply for funding in respect of recycling and recovery infrastructure; green waste facilities are among the infrastructure types which are eligible for such funding and nine composting facilities have been allocated grant assistance to date.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>his views on whether mandatory rights of way should be incorporated into county development plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated in last November&rsquo;s D&aacute;il debate on the Private Member&rsquo;s Bill on this subject, I do not consider it appropriate that it should be mandatory to include objectives for the preservation and listing of existing public rights of way in county development plans. I believe that the mandatory inclusion of all public rights of way could lead to much controversy in the preparation and adoption of the development plan and that there would be many appeals by landowners against the inclusion of rights of way, which could have the effect of clogging up our judicial system. I also consider that it would be overly onerous on planning authorities to require them to list all existing public rights of way in preparing their development plans and it would divert their scarce resources away from priority operational and strategic tasks, such as the zoning of land for housing and the making of planning decisions. The proposed mandatory listing of all public rights of way into county development plans would also substantially dilute the plans&rsquo; strategic <Col N="1856"/>content due to a significant proportion of their text and maps being taken up with the listing of such public rights of way.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 allows planning authorities, at their own discretion, to include such objectives in their development plans. I consider that this is a reasonable approach, which allows for planning authorities to gradually add to the rights of way listed in their development plans.</P>
        <P>As I said in this House last November, the Government wishes to promote access to countryside for the benefit of rural tourism and sustainable rural development, but also believes that the issue of public access to the countryside is better dealt with through co-operation and consultation with landowners. The House may be aware that Comhairle na Tuaithe, the countryside recreation council, which is widely representative of countryside and outdoor interests, was established last year by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in order to ensure that all those with an interest and concern for the sustainable development and management of recreational amenities in the Irish countryside are fully consulted on the future management of these amenities. As I understand it, the remit of the council is to develop and update, as necessary, a national countryside/outdoor recreation strategy; ensure that all means necessary are used to resolve conflicts that arise in relation to access issues; raise awareness of the benefits to and responsibilities of recreational use of the countryside, and carry out research and training on related issues.</P>
        <P>I consider that the issue of public access to the countryside is better dealt with through such a co-operative measure rather than through the mandatory preservation and listing of all public rights of way in development plans.</P>
