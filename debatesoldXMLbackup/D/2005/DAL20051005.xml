    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to return to the issue of the failed &euro;150 million PPARS computer system which the Taoiseach defended in the House yesterday. Before raising a number of matters to which the Taoiseach referred, I point out the difference between the briefing document given to him and the T&aacute;naiste and their presentations on this system. The Taoiseach accused me yesterday of being dishonest in the presentation of facts. This is not an accusation I take lightly. I want the Taoiseach to be honest about his remarks to the House when he defended this system.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated the PPARS system is not an IT system. That is wrong. How does he explain that in her statement yesterday the T&aacute;naiste used the term &ldquo;IT&rdquo; or &ldquo;information technology&rdquo; on ten occasions? Furthermore, the Department of Finance in its letter of 28 June to the Department of Health and Children stated it was also surprised at the seeming IT focus of the national team. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that in the mid-1990s the health boards alone decided they needed a better payroll system. That is wrong. The decision to embark on the PPARS system was taken jointly by the health boards and the Department of Health and Children. This was clearly stated in the Hay report, to which the Taoiseach referred yesterday. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is intervening with his own information. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated in the House that Deloitte &amp; Touche had trained 140,000 staff. That is wrong. Deloitte &amp; Touche did not train 140,000 staff. It employed 40 young graduates who sought new experience. The Department of Finance letter stated that the Deloitte &amp; Touche staff were &ldquo;mirroring&rdquo; house staff, with no added value. Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated in the House that last October the Health Service Executive, with officials from the Department of Finance, stated several times through the news media that it was reviewing the system. That is wrong. There was <Col N="1582"/>no such indication of a review of the system last October. In fact, on 2 November last in answer to a parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste sang the praises of the PPARS system and stated: &ldquo;It is anticipated that the PPARS system will be implemented in all health board areas by the end of 2005.&rdquo; However, the Irish Nurses Organisation yesterday revealed that as recently as July and September of this year, the PPARS office was telling the INO that there was no longer any review of the system. On those four issues, the Taoiseach is wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach should take the opportunity to correct those inaccuracies and tell the House whether he has issued an instruction to the HSE to continue with this system despite the T&aacute;naiste saying that if it is wrong, the Government will throw its hands up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I stated yesterday that the health boards first mooted the idea of a payroll system for the health sector in 1994-95. That is the factual position. However, they did not follow through on that system. To answer Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s first question, discussions took place and the original proposal was broadened out over time from that of a computerised payroll system to one dealing with the recording of personnel information, payments of pensions, recruitment, time management and rostering. In early 2001, the cost estimated by Hay Management Consultants for this expanded functionality, which was an entirely different system from the one initially considered, was &euro;100 million.</P>
      <P>Hay Management Consultants were hired at that time to examine the expanded project rather than the original scheme which had not been followed in 1994-95. Some &euro;100 million was considered a realistic estimate and the Hay organisation stated that the project was worth supporting. The summary of its report indicated the PPARS system should be seen as more as a business change programme than a system implementation programme, to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s second question. The timescale was envisaged as being three years. In 2002, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children gave permission for PPARS to proceed. The expanded system initially went live in three health board areas, covering approximately 40,000 staff.</P>
      <P>To answer Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s further question, I stated yesterday that 140,000 staff were on the system. I heard a good and eminent friend of mine, Maurice Nelligan, question that figure on radio yesterday when he stated that there were only 100,000 staff. However, the figure for 100,000 whole-time equivalents includes voluntary and part-time staff, so my good friend Maurice Nelligan was wrong too.</P>

	<P>That is some help.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1583"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In implementing the project a number of major IT issues must be addressed, including the accurate recording of over 25 different staff rosters and employment conditions for staff which are entirely dependent on the relevant health board. As a result, there were wide variations in attendance hours, annual leave and attendances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should store them with the electronic voting machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Deputy Kenny. A decision was taken to incorporate these variations into the new system, which dramatically increased the complexity of the manual intervention. Of course, considering the current situation, it would have been far better if they stuck to trying to get the payroll system right, but they did not. I am not here to dump on anyone; I am answering questions on what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is trying to pass the buck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not passing the buck. I do not do that. I will answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should accept responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer the questions and am glad to do so. To answer Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s other question, I am informed the Comptroller and Auditor General raised this issue in his report last year &mdash; that is what I referred to yesterday. It was stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering Deputy Kenny. I stated yesterday and the T&aacute;naiste stated previously that it would cost another &euro;56 million up to March 2006 to complete the system. Some &euro;20 million of that cost comprises payroll costs, with the rest being consultancy fees to Deloitte &amp; Touche and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>His time is definitely up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>When the HSE was established, the Department of Finance had concerns. The Department had a number of meetings this year, which have been documented, at which it raised its concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Surprise, surprise.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1584"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need for me to list all those concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>There is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are in the letter. The Department of Finance said it believed the costs were excessive, that Deloitte &amp; Touche was being overused and that it would have been better if staff had gone in. It asked for all that information to be supplied to it by 8 July. It is that review between the Departments of Finance and Health and Children and the Health Service Executive which has led to what has been going on for the past few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Minister blissfully unaware of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards any suggestion that somebody here has uncovered something, nobody has uncovered anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because it has been clear all year in the discussions between the Departments of Health and Children and Finance that they had concerns about aspects of this system. That is not to say this entire system is a waste of time and that they should undo what they have done. That is a different issue. I do not believe they should do so. They should continue to try to develop the system so the new HSE, an organisation bringing together 11 disparate health boards, has a proper system. They have not done it very well to date but they should continue to try to get it right and use money correctly. That is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should put down the shovel at this stage if he is to follow the old maxim of the late Denis Healey that when one is in a hole, one should stop digging. He has not answered the question as to whether he has given some instruction to the HSE, in its independence, to continue with this system. The T&aacute;naiste said the Government would throw its hands up if found out and if things have gone wrong.</P>
      <P>I was sent a confidential memo by nurses from all over the country. Does the Taoiseach realise nurse managers and nursing staff were taken off overcrowded wards at busy periods to attend six mandatory four hour courses on this PPARS system? Does he realise the difficulties that created for patients, doctors and nurses, that is, to deal with a system which patently did not work? One nurse in Cork received an overpayment of &euro;3,000. In a sample carried out by the former Midland Health Board, 43% of the sample had one or more errors on their payslip. Some 20 nurses in Wexford were overpaid as were nurses in Donegal. This system which the <Col N="1585"/>Government and the people in the Department of Health and Children were supposed to oversee is patently not working. Where were the systems to protect the taxpayer in respect of the consultants brought in to advise on how this should operate and who have been paid &euro;50 million?</P>
      <P>Will the review which will be carried out cover all aspects of what went on from the moment this project began? Will it cover the whole business of recruitment? Will we find out who were the experts brought into this country from outside on a regular basis &mdash; some from as far away as South Africa? Will it cover all the recruitment given that some experts only turned up for work three days per week despite being paid &euro;1,200 per day?</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach wants to know, as he should do, about what the people are, and were, talking, he should ask himself how he can defend the fact that last Christmas a major social bash was held in Sligo costing in excess of &euro;40,000 to celebrate the ongoing progress of this scheme when the people attending it were all talking not only about its shallowness and vulgarity but about how money could be found to hold something such as that when in October of last year a good and decent man who lived 150 yards from Monaghan hospital died because he could not get into it because of a lack of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know the challenges of moving from 11 health boards to one HSE. The review which the HSE is undertaking tomorrow will be to see where it has brought this system and whether it should continue in some other way to try to bring the payroll system and all the other functions together. It is clear the amount of money it has taken to date to do it in the way it has been following is far too excessive. The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have made that clear and the HSE accepts that. What it thought it could do in three years is not possible.</P>
      <P>What is clear, however, is that one cannot have a manual payroll system for 140,000 individuals and where there is no proper recording of how many individuals work in the organisation and how rosters operate. It cannot have a management system such as that. The fact is it does not have a management system. It has spent ten years trying to get a management system. While I have not been in the former health boards or in the Health Service Executive trying to run the system, I acknowledge that to run the HSE and to have a proper health service based on the reforms this Government has brought in, we need a proper system. That is the right thing to do. This Government is entirely opposed to anyone abusing the way in which money is spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P><Col N="1586"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>During its watch this Government has increased public expenditure from &euro;16 billion to &euro;40 billion so that resources are available. In the past, &euro;16 billion was available but now &euro;40 billion is available for people to spend correctly. The various Accounting Officers and agencies have a responsibility to do that. We will accept our responsibility and will work with them to do so. The correct thing for the Health Service Executive to do is to see, based on what the Departments of Finance and Health and Children have said to it, what it can build on, what it needs to abandon and how should move on. That is the correct thing to do. For Opposition Members to suggest one does not need any system to run a staff of 140,000 is so unhelpful and irresponsible and they should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I point out to Members that Deputy Rabbitte is entitled to ask his question without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He will not get an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is entitled to respond without interruption so Deputy Rabbitte will hear the answer to his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. That could be very useful as this goes on. Unusually, yesterday I had the opportunity to listen to the Taoiseach outside the House. The only thing more breathtaking than washing &euro;160 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money down the toilet bowl was the breathtaking and contemptuous disingenuousness and dishonesty of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response. How can he grow so far removed from people who get up at 6.30 a.m. to commute long distances to work to pay their taxes and stand over his Government wasting their money in this fashion? How is it that no Minister in his Government ever takes responsibility for anything? How is it that the Taoiseach cannot come into this House for a change and admit there has been a monumental cock-up, a Niagara of waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, instead of making snide remarks about Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s facility with sums, misplacing the dateline for the origins of this project, telling the House it is not an IT system and simply trying to stonewall his way through it?</P>
      <P>This is exactly the same circumstance as we have had with so many other projects. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, thinks it is enough to go on television and say the Government will take a hit on e-voting. It is not the Government that will take the hit but the taxpayer. The T&aacute;naiste came in and said the Government would put its hands up if it finds it is wrong. She has not been able to take her hands down since she took over from the former Minister, Deputy Martin. It is one disaster <Col N="1587"/>after another. This morning I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, say &euro;160 million was only a small fraction in the context of the health spend since 1998.</P>
      <P>Another &euro;160 million would build another Adelaide and Meath Hospital in Tallaght. Is that insignificant? To top it off this morning, we had the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the last man standing to defend e-voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy voted for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What kind of Government is the Taoiseach running? When will we see any admission for any of the mistakes? On 13 October at a conference on PPARS, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, said &ldquo;The meticulous attention to detail which was paid during the development and implementation of PPARS in the early phases of the project will pay dividends as the system is rolled out throughout the health service&rdquo;. Is this the kind of dividend the Minister of State had in mind?</P>

	<P>Which Minister is going to be blamed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The problem, as Deputy Rabbitte knows, is that outside the House one only gets two minutes.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1588"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Seldom one gets two minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but if Deputy Rabbitte had heard all I said yesterday, he would have realised that I was pointing out that a decade ago the health boards decided they needed to move from a manual payroll system to a proper information communications technology system. They did not move on with this in 1994 or 1995. In 2000 they returned to the issue and got approval for a more extensive system. Hay consultants costed the system at &euro;100 million. Up until the end of 2004, it has spent &euro;116 million, &euro;16 million more than projected. They projected that to complete it would take &euro;56 million. Unfortunately, they thought it could be done in three years when that was not possible. I do not know the technical complexities of this.</P>
      <P>Approximately, 40,000 people out of 140,000 people were brought into the payroll system. This was not putting money down the lavatory bowl. What has been achieved is useful but not as extensive as it was believed it would be. Following consultations that went on for the last several months between the Departments of Finance and Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, it has been decided that the way in which it has been done in the past few years, and given the excessive costs to Deloitte &amp; Touche, should be reassessed and they should find another way. The executive still needs a proper payroll and management system.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Down the years, the health boards had not been able to tell the Departments of Finance or Health and Children how many staff they had. There was a myriad different rules and procedures. The Hay report pointed out that even if the health boards could get on top of the reduction in absenteeism at the time, they would save &euro;56 million per annum. At the time it was believed that by spending &euro;100 million or even &euro;150 million, it could be dealt with in a three year period. This made sense at the time. It was looked at by Hay and Gartland and they believed these were the best consultants for the project. It has not worked as originally believed.</P>
      <P>I am not in the House to dump on every official in every health board or Department that tried to help bring in a good system. I am not a computer expert but it is disingenuous to say that when people tried but did not get a proper management system right for a payroll of &euro;7 billion, then they are all a crowd of nitwits. I do not believe they are. They were trying to do their best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>So were the Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They overused outside consultants and should not have had a consultancy contract to the extent they had. I accept Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s valid point on this. In my Department, we brought in the entire e-Cabinet project on <Col N="1589"/>time and on budget for &euro;5 million. The reason we did this was because we used our own staff. If I did not have that expertise in the Department, it would have cost a fortune. I was not prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important the Health Service Executive gets a proper system so that at least the organisation will know who and how many are on its payroll. It does not have that system and it must be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Go out and count them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not want to see taxpayers&rsquo; money wasted but we need a system that will prevent waste in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Would it not be far more honest and decisive for the Taoiseach to take action against whichever Minister is the more culpable? In this case, it seems to be the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. Everything he touches ends up costing the taxpayer at least tens of millions of euro. He is still shooting around the place having his photograph taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>He is probably having it done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>He seems to think the job is that of a male model rather than a Minister who manages his Department.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has a different approach. She adopts this folksy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Since he was appointed, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has become so oily and self-satisfied, one could plug the national grid into him.</P>

    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s approach is how could it work if there were so many incoherent, different systems in the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Deputy Rabbitte without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How could it work if there were all these different pay cycles, people working part-time and people paid fortnightly? However, we knew all that. Is that not the whole point of the exercise?</P>
      <P Just="Left">I do not agree with the Taoiseach that all the people involved are nitwits. These are the people who tried to tell this to the Government and call a halt but were ignored. These are the people who knew a botched job was being made by the consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche. It would be more appropriate to call them Delighted &amp; Touche because they must be delighted with the kind of money they raked off the Exchequer. Will any action be taken by the Government against the consultants brought into the project and given &euro;50 million?

	<P>This is money wasted. The character of the Government is to waste this inheritance over the last eight years. While this is one of the biggest cock-ups, the Minister responsible, Deputy Martin, is being photographed somewhere. The T&aacute;naiste adopts the approach that when she came in she tried to clean up the place and one should have seen the mess she discovered. This side of the House is then expected to say the T&aacute;naiste is great. The computer system is not working in the Department of Health and Children and neither is the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the phenomenon of flushing money down the toilet. I want to raise a related issue dealing with sewage treatment, which in more ways than one is another example of flushing money down the toilet. At the opening of the Ringsend treatment plant, the Taoiseach covered himself in glory opening what he called a state-of-the-art facility. The fact it was based on old census figures, that it creates an almighty smell and that his Government has not carried out any official investigation, but uses money on a daily basis to try to patch up what was a botched job is a salient lesson.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>This is particularly true for people who met last night in large numbers in Portrane in north County Dublin to hear about a surprise proposal to turn what was a perfectly acceptable plan for a sewage treatment plant suitable for a population of 65,000 into one which we are informed will cost &euro;2.6 billion and will serve more than 1 million people. This has come out of the blue as another example of a project to suit &ldquo;Mr. Big&rdquo;. Even from a technical perspective, whatever about the politics, a large treatment plant will be prone to odours because the effluent must travel such distances in air-free pipes and there will be a stinking mess by the time it arrives at the treatment plant. Can the Taoiseach take on board the clear scientific observations that have been made repeatedly by the community in Ringsend and by people who know about sewage treatment? Can he also take on board that this plan will hide the cowboy polluter? It will be more difficult to trace the source of whatever is being put down the toilet at a greater distance from the treatment plant.</P>
      <P>In the interests of his own party in terms of the next election, I ask the Taoiseach to take Deputy Glennon&rsquo;s wishes into account. Speaking on radio today, the Deputy stated he found this proposal unacceptable and was going to bring it to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention. The Taoiseach should put Deputy Glennon out of his misery and state whether he agrees with him. Will the Taoiseach state it is wrong to go ahead with this proposal? Will the Taoiseach allow the county council to proceed with the original plant suitable for a population of 65,000? Ultimately, will he respect the wishes of the local councillors who will also reject it, or will he, as he has done previously, overturn the decision and throw out democracy? Will the Taoiseach respect the wishes of the local councillors?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Sandymount plant scheme mentioned by the Deputy was a great work by the engineering section of Dublin City Council, working in partnership with the private sector to bring about a totally modern scheme. I am aware there have been some difficulties in trying to deal with all the problems. While I am not a member of the city council, my understanding is that the council&rsquo;s engineers have been trying to surmount them.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the council has done an enormous amount of work to alleviate the massive problems of pollution that we had in Dublin Bay for the last two generations. It is great to see the beaches on the coastline along Dublin Bay again receiving environmental flags this summer. That has been an enormous and dramatic change brought about by the investment in the scheme.</P>
      <P>I will not answer local authority matters. I am answerable for enough other matters. If the council has a project in Donabate and is talking to local residents, I am sure that between them, the local public representatives will make their view clear. Undoubtedly, Deputy Glennon will also make his views clear, and hopefully Deputy Sargent will support them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach still has not stated whether there will be an investigation into how Ringsend became such a botched job. I still want an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is under investigation.</P>

	<P>No one is taking responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not at all satisfactory for the Taoiseach to state he is leaving it up to the council. The European Court will be down on his head on the basis of his failure to, as the European Commission press release puts it, put in place satisfactory rules to prevent malodours from urban waste water treatment plants in accordance with the EU Waste Framework Directive. It is the Government&rsquo;s job to put such measures in place for the local authorities to comply with. The Government has not done so. It has also informed the European Commission that it will introduce promised legislation to better regulate the management of such plants. However, in <Col N="1595"/>January, the European Commission noted this has not materialised. The European Commission has been very polite about this matter. Essentially, it is threatening to take the Government to court. I again ask if the Taoiseach will give this matter the priority it needs. Will he learn the lesson from the Ringsend plant and focus on the original plan, which was to have more localised sustainable and manageable plants serving the communities which need them? Has the Taoiseach learned that lesson yet? Will he learn it before he goes cruising for a bruising electorally and legally, as the European Commission will not stand for the current position?</P>

	<P>That is incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As for the second question, the legislation is necessary &mdash; in dealing with the EU, all these matters are necessary. However, the Deputy is aware that we have spent approximately &euro;1.5 billion on 75 new waste water treatment schemes around the country, which has brought a major improvement to the quality of water in rivers and lakes. New waste water schemes are being provided with secondary treatment facilities for every location with a population of over 1,000. There have been more schemes such as these in the last few years than in previous generations.</P>

	<P>They are the best in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been stated by the European Commission that some of the work done on this has led to extremely high quality water. The Water Services Bill 2003, which is before the Houses, will consolidate and modernise the code of water services. We could not have done that if we had not invested the money we did in these waste water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1596"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Smaller plants work better.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>If they work better, then they should be discussed at council level.</P>

	<P>If the residents of Donabate have concerns, I have no doubt that they will put those concerns to their public representatives. Those concerns will be dealt with by the planners and engineers of the appropriate councils who are well used to listening to people&rsquo;s concerns. Hopefully they will come to a satisfactory resolution.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must acknowledge the dramatic improvements in water quality and in dealing with sewage and effluent. In areas of population growth, we are trying to provide the proper and efficient services that are required. The population is projected to grow in 15 years to 5 million and we need to make further investments in these services. We must not go back to the position where we pumped waste water into the bay and polluted it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>No one is suggesting that we do that.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The last plenary meeting of the social partners, which I attended together with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Mini<Col N="1598"/>ster for Finance, took place in Dublin Castle on 14 July and included an assessment of the overall progress that has been made in the implementation of Sustaining Progress, including in particular the special initiatives. I made very clear the Government&rsquo;s continued strong commitment to pursuing Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social prosperity through the process of social dialogue and partnership. I also expressed appreciation for the key contribution made by the social partners to the development of our economy and society. One of the innovations under Sustaining Progress was the agreement on a number of special initiatives. There is a general consensus among the social partners that they have proven to be a very effective way of focusing resources on particular areas of concern. Undoubtedly, there are lessons to be learned from the experience of implementing these initiatives, including lessons about what kind of areas on which to focus, how many special initiatives on which to focus and what mechanisms we might best use to approach them. I expect these issues will be taken up in the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
        <P>The considerable progress that has been made in implementing the wide-ranging set of commitments contained in Sustaining Progress is borne out by the ninth progress report and the final report on the special initiatives, which were produced for the plenary meeting. Copies of these reports together with the report of the steering group to the ninth plenary meeting and speeches have been laid in the Oireachtas Library. We have had six national partnership agreements since 1987 and are due to formally launch the negotiations on a new agreement at the next plenary meeting which will take place in November. I have invited the social partner organisations to participate in these negotiations in the context that the Government will be entering talks on the basis of our programme for Government and within the framework of the forthcoming NESC three-year strategic economic and social overview.</P>
        <P>The national implementation body, which includes employer and union representatives, operates under the chairmanship of my Department. Its purpose is to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of the Sustaining Progress agreement. The body has met on a number of occasions recently to assist in the resolution of industrial relations disputes in both the public and private sectors. Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussion of some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally. The national implementation body does not seek in any way to duplicate or substitute already well-established industrial relations machinery. The role it serves is complementary in helping to identify and overcome obstacles to effective participation in these <Col N="1599"/>wider processes. The body will continue to meet as necessary to this end.</P>
        <P>There is certainly plenty for the Government and the social partners to reflect on as we look beyond Sustaining Progress. The main risks to growth and inflation stem from potential second round-effects in wage and price setting behaviour resulting from ongoing oil price increases. In this context, the response of incomes policies will be critical to the short to medium outlook of the economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">History shows the folly of trying to compensate ourselves for the effects of increases in oil prices. Social partnership has been of enormous benefit both socially and economically. Since the Programme for National Recovery in 1987, the stability it provides has allowed for record levels of growth and enhanced social inclusion. In recent times of more moderate growth, the processes of social partnership have helped maintain competitiveness and a pro-jobs environment while enhancing a co-ordinated and comprehensive approach to inclusiveness issues. This continues to be the overriding challenge looking ahead.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I have already mentioned, the National Economic and Social Council is currently undertaking its three yearly strategic overview of economic and social policy, paving the way to negotiations on a successor to Sustaining Progress. The NESC has completed its study entitled The Developmental Welfare State, which was published on 19 May 2005. The council completed its report, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy in December 2004. In the coming months, it will complete a report on the Lisbon Strategy, focusing on the open method of coordination. Other studies in the council&rsquo;s work programme include migration policy, child poverty and child income supports, Ireland&rsquo;s first periodic social report, the taxation system in the medium term, competition and regulation in networked sectors, as well as a significant NESC contribution to a knowledge society foresight exercise. The reconstituted NESF held its inaugural meeting on 26 May 2004 in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, at which the work programme for the coming term up to 2006 was discussed, as well as the appropriate structures and working arrangements in the context of this work programme. Early childhood care and education, care for older people and creating a more inclusive labour market were subsequently selected as priority topics.</P>
        <P>The report on early childhood care and education has been completed. Following consideration by Government, it was published on 25 September 2005. A plenary session of the NESF was held on 28 September 2005 to discuss the draft report of the project team on care for older people. The report is now being finalised in light of the comments made at the plenary and will be submitted to Government shortly. A plenary <Col N="1600"/>session to discuss the final draft report of the project team on creating a more inclusive labour market will be held on 19 October 2005 in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. Cultural citizenship and delivery of public services have been identified for inclusion in the second phase of the work programme. Preliminary work has been undertaken on both these topics and projects in these areas will commence shortly. The NESF held the second national anti-poverty strategy social inclusion forum in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham on 26 January 2005. The social inclusion forum gives those who are not directly involved in the social partnership process an opportunity to input their views and experiences in implementing the national anti-poverty strategy. A report of the proceedings was published in April.</P>
        <P>Finally, the NESF hosted, in conjunction with UCD, a conference of evidence-based policy making on 10 February 2005. The conference examined the supply and gathering of evidence and applying this in the policy making process and the design of practical policy solutions. The ongoing monitoring and evaluation of policy outcomes was an important focus of the conference. A conference report is being prepared for publication.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a comprehensive reply from the Taoiseach. I noted the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> outlining his concern about social partnership, arising from the actions of Irish Ferries. There seems to be an indication that he is taking legal advice on the matter of the State contribution to the company redundancy package. The report goes on to state the Taoiseach hinted at legislative change in this area. Can the Taoiseach elaborate on that? Does the Taoiseach care to comment on the remarks made by Jack O&rsquo;Connor in respect of continuing in social partnership, given recent events? When will consumers have a seat at the partnership table in respect of social partnership talks? Will the Taoiseach comment on the current disputes at Irish Ferries, An Post and ESB, which are currently of concern to a great number of people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Ferries dispute shows precisely the value of social partnership. I expressed the view in the House that the behaviour of the company in refusing to engage with the Labour Court and other industrial relations machinery, and its being intent on an apparent breach of obligations under Sustaining Progress, was unacceptable. The national implementation body correctly recommended to the parties, including the company, that the invitation to attend the Labour Court should be accepted. Both representatives of IBEC put their views on the record very publicly in this regard while fully expressing the difficulties experienced by the company. We can all understand the difficulties <Col N="1601"/>any company can face from competition but there is still a process to be followed and this should be done.</P>
        <P>I very much welcome the fact that the company has now decided to fully participate in the process recommended by the court, including returning to it if necessary. This is how our business should be done. My point was not that a company had difficulties; it was the process to which I objected. I accept the company has difficulties, including competitiveness. I stated the process should be followed, which the company is now doing.</P>
        <P>I very much regret the decision of the Communications Workers Union to proceed to a national ballot for industrial action. The situation in An Post, as in all postal services, is very serious. The viability of the company in the light of technical and market changes is critically dependent on its ability to adapt, become more efficient and to exploit new technology to the full. This is the only way in which An Post workers, like those in any business, can have reasonable security of employment at the pay levels to which they aspire and need.</P>
        <P>Along with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I met the An Post unions at their request some time ago. I left that meeting with the knowledge that the need for change and the nature of change has been the subject of extensive discussions. An expert review has taken place in accordance with the terms of Sustaining Progress and with the direct involvement of the Labour Court. The payment of the increases provided under Sustaining Progress is contingent on co-operation and ongoing change. Provision was also made for payment to be linked to necessary changes to offset the additional costs on the basis that the Labour Court would adjudicate on that issue. That is what happened in this case with the assistance of a detailed review by independent experts.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed with the decision that has been taken because the threat of industrial action to overturn the outcome of the process agreed under Sustaining Progress is not satisfactory either from the employer&rsquo;s or employees&rsquo; side. Last week I criticised matters from the employer&rsquo;s side and this week I do so from the employees&rsquo; side. Industrial action that displaces the outcome of negotiation and, ultimately, adjudication of the Labour Court risks undermining the stability on which jobs and incomes rest and it is wrong to do that.</P>
        <P>Industrial action in An Post would only deepen the problems and put jobs and living standards at risk. I urge members of the CWU to consider very carefully the options before them. It is not open to Government to change the realities faced by the company and its employees. At the meeting we had I believed they understood that. I accept there are difficulties but the path recommended by the Labour Court is the only sensible <Col N="1602"/>solution and I recommend it most strongly to the employees of An Post. We will see where we go from here.</P>
        <P>I have not had a chance to read the full script regarding social partnership from the head of SIPTU, Jack O&rsquo;Connor, whom I regularly meet, but I can understand his concerns about Irish Ferries and other companies. SIPTU has had it own difficulties on the Gama issue over the years. It is important for the union that we do not get into a race to the bottom and that the protection of employment standards is an important public policy goal. The best way of dealing with that is within social partnership. Any of the analysis that has been done on this by IR people, other than those on the extreme left who are really against social partnership anyway and have never supported any of the six agreements, shows it is the best way forward. The benefits are there for all to see. I will not go through them all. Anyone looking at where we have come from and where we are would see the benefits of social partnership. Of course there are tensions from time to time but there is less tension and fewer strikes in the private sector. We will have to see where it goes. A considerable number of trade unions want social partnership. I urge those in SIPTU to see the overall benefits as well. I hope they will do that in the days ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask the Taoiseach, in respect of the speech he made in July at Dublin Castle to the effect that the era of tax cuts was over as a bargaining counter in these discussions, if that is still his position?</P>
        <P>In respect of the remarks he has just made about An Post, there is a very serious underlying grievance in terms of workers who could not in any circumstances be described as highly paid, operating in a very high cost society and who are still not provided with the basic increases agreed under the social contract. That especially impacts on the position of pensioners. Is it not a grievance so long afterwards that it must be more speedily addressed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is right. That is a major grievance. I have met, as I am sure he has, many of the individuals concerned. That was comprehensively dealt with in the Labour Court findings. Every one of us who has met any postal workers during the course of the year would have heard that issue raised but it has been dealt with.</P>
        <P>I agree that many An Post workers are not highly paid. The company is under significant pressure. The hard reality is that there are now many private operators in the delivery business and e-mail and other technologies have taken a large part of the business. Postmen have told me that little post remains if the free post and the business we give them are removed from their deliveries, even though we are under pressure <Col N="1603"/>from the EU because of the competition aspect. Every three years there is a battle because the State is giving them work and the market is continually looking for that work. I do not know how long it will be before Europe comes down on that issue. In the past 20 years we have found good ways of holding on to these areas but the pressure is increasing.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that the business is out there and everything is the same. Technology has changed the position. I accept the issue raised by Deputy Rabbitte is important but it is addressed in the Labour Court decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The first question I asked the Taoiseach was about his speech in Dublin Castle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That was just one aspect of what I said, that incomes policy was a large part of the agreement. We must keep our incomes at rates we can afford. I opposed the idea of trying to chase the secondary costs that would come from some aspects of energy, although perhaps they will not be as bad as I thought at the time. Social partnership should not just become a race on incomes, which is what happened before in some cases, as that would not get us anywhere. I also said that the resources were no longer available to give the kind of cuts that had been given over the years. Effectively, &euro;5 billion has been given in tax cuts.</P>
        <P>Although it was not reported at the time, and one national newspaper dropped the second part of what I said entirely, which always happens, I went on to point out that I was not talking about areas of indexation, I was talking about cuts. Indexation is something which the partnership process considers should be implemented. I was talking about cuts in rates, as distinct from the aim of trying to get 80% of people paying standard rate tax. Cutting down any more on tax from where we are now is neither necessary nor likely. We had high rates of tax but we decreased them. As I stated, there is now a demand to build up our services. At a 30% rate of tax, we are now eight points lower than anywhere else in Europe. There is no pressure to do any more in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Without going into the detail of the Irish Ferries scandal, does the Taoiseach agree that the conduct of the employer in that particular case represents a threat to the very partnership process itself? Does he accept the practice of letting go Irish workers and replacing them with vulnerable workers from eastern Europe and elsewhere, who are to be paid outrageously low wages, is not only a threat to social partnership but also undermines all the best practices concerning the protection of the rights of the workers&rsquo; concerned, and the rights of all workers? <Col N="1604"/>Does he agree it is not acceptable that IBEC has come out in support of the employer&rsquo;s position in the Irish Ferries dispute and that its stated position is also a threat to the continuation of the partnership process?</P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach take up the proposal in the motion tabled by me and the other Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and call on the European Commission to introduce urgently a European ferries directive aimed at combating what is described as social dumping on ferries and at setting minimum labour standards to ensure an end to the exploitation of workers on all intra-EU passenger and ferry services? Has he noted that his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, said in response to the proposal that he was quite taken with the idea of taking up the issue at European level. However, he felt there was nothing the Government could do. Does the Taoiseach agree it is imperative that this issue be raised at European level?</P>
        <P>I was disappointed when the Taoiseach lumped Questions Nos. 1 to 15 together because the grouping incorporated Question No. 15, which I had tabled on the National Economic and Social Forum. Having noted the Taoiseach&rsquo;s welcome of the forum&rsquo;s report on early childhood care and education, I wonder, in light of the focus of my earlier question, whether the Taoiseach will indicate his acceptance of the key recommendations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is more appropriate to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach has accepted Question No. 15 in this grouping.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Question No. 15 is a general question on the National Economic and Social Forum. We cannot go into detail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the Taoiseach, in light of the forum&rsquo;s most recent report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach cannot be permitted to give detailed replies to questions that are the responsibility of another Minister. I am allowing the Deputy&rsquo;s first three questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has already issued a public statement on the NESF report. Will he indicate whether he is responding positively with the intent of embracing and implementing the key recommendations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am allowing the Deputy&rsquo;s first three questions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1605"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday on Leaders&rsquo; Questions I spelled out the policy on seafarers. This country, being an island, has always tried to have as many qualified and trained seafarers as possible and to maintain employment for them. I believe the National Maritime College, which, unfortunately, I have not visited, is considered internationally to be of the highest quality. Some &euro;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been invested in it. Those involved with the college are very proud of what it has achieved. Our concept was to have a policy whereby we would have a country of trained seafarers with expertise. This is happening with much success.</P>
        <P>The seafaring issue and the question of operating under the flag of convenience do not just pertain to EU law, they are global matters. I am not against the European Union having some kind of examination of these but, on the basis of my understanding and the statements of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, and the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, there are difficulties in this regard because of the global nature of the issues and the fact that people are going outside their zones. The question of how this can be managed or policed, either from an Irish or European position, presents an extraordinary difficulty. That is what the companies have been saying also. All the companies are now employing international staff and moving around the world with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about intra-EU ferry companies?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose it does not rule out EuroMed, for example, trying to reach some understanding on how one can achieve what the Deputy proposes. It is not an easy issue to address. I have been given information in the past week on what is happening in respect of all the operators, not just Irish Ferries. The information concerns not only those operating on the Irish Sea but also to those operating on other seas. They are all engaged in a similar practice. As I said last week, it is obviously not one with which I agree.</P>
        <P>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question on the practices of Irish Ferries having a knock-on effect, the protection of employment standards is an important goal of public policy. We do not want to revive a low-wage economy in this country and, in particular, we do not want to foster a social division by having decent jobs held by Irish citizens become low-paid positions targeted at migrant workers. That is precisely what we do not want to do. The country has invested considerably in tackling poverty and inequality. I am certainly not prepared to see this undone by short-sighted and exploitative decisions, which some of <Col N="1606"/>the companies in question seem to believe are all right. Ultimately, if one goes down this road, the State will wind up subsidising the individuals concerned because unsustainable low-paid employment will have to be augmented through family income supplement, social services and so on. I am satisfied we have a realistic minimum wage in this country to protect against this form of exploitation. It represents good protection of employment.</P>
        <P>I have listened to many experts in this field in recent weeks because of the Irish Ferries issue. They all say the circumstances of the maritime sector would appear to put employment of seafarers beyond the minimum wage regime here. Both sides seem to say this is the position and that directly comparable circumstances should therefore not arise in other employments. However, I would be concerned about this in spite of what people say. Issues arise from recent events which we all need to consider, including the arrangements for repayment of part of the costs of redundancy settlements to employers and the adequacy of our industrial relations framework in circumstances such as these.</P>
        <P>I meant to say in reply to Deputy Rabbitte the other day that we should make it very clear that the Government, and everyone in the House, did not agree to immediate access to the Irish labour market by citizens of new member states to displace Irish workers. We agreed to it because it was right to allow newly acceded countries to gain access to the European Union. This was not a green light for employers to decide it presented a way to cut their costs and increase profitability.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the non-EU workers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope they take serious note of that.</P>
        <P>A decision has not yet been made on the recommendations but the Minister will consider them and come to a conclusion on them. An interdepartmental report took into account the NESF and NESC reports and also some of the other reports. A host of reports have been presented on child care and the interdepartmental group is considering them collectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>On the successor to Sustaining Progress, in respect of which I hope there will be a satisfactory outcome to the discussions, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the lessons learned from the Irish Ferries issue will give rise to any change to the current agenda? Does the Taoiseach have in mind any guarantee for the rights of workers in this jurisdiction that could form part of a successor to Sustaining Progress? Does he really believe this can stop with Irish Ferries? Is there not a danger that Ryanair will <Col N="1607"/>want to explore the possibility of following the same low cost option and the pressure will then impact on Aer Lingus and Ryanair competing with Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann will put pressure on competitors down the line? Did the Taoiseach look into this to see if we are unravelling a social understanding which exists or can we say that this is as far as it will go with Irish Ferries?</P>
        <P>One of my questions to the Taoiseach concerned contingency plans for and discussions on fuel prices. Is it not time to recognise the benefit of having an environmental pillar in the partnership process and to recognise that what may be challenges for more conservative sectors are opportunities in terms of energy efficiency and renewable energy options for other sectors? It should be put into the new partnership agreement so that we may benefit from the opportunities the change in fuel prices will bring while having to accommodate that change. Ireland is unique in being unable to connect domestic renewable energy providers to the grid and in not having any grant system for installation of solar panels and for many other technologies that are taken for granted in other countries. Will the Taoiseach take that suggestion on board?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I pointed out the difficulties in terms of the seafarers issue and what is said by both sides. The Government did not agree to immediate access to the Irish labour market by citizens of new member states in order to displace Irish workers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with EU member states. It is outside the EU.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be concerned if people did that, either inside or outside the EU. If they are outside the EU, they cannot come in without permits. A small number come in from outside the EU, so there is no difficulty in that area.</P>
        <P>I recognise in broad terms and from looking at many companies the commercial realities and competitive pressures that will impact on employment here that are not sustainable. Outsourcing can be a necessary legitimate response to those pressures. It generally involves a reorganisation of work practices and protection systems. In that sense it is not a direct displacement of one worker by another.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question, the best defence for workers against these pressures is to ensure that our approach to wage bargaining is responsible and reflects competitive realities. Then we do not become uncompetitive and do not have people trying to come in and undercut in that way, at least in most cases.</P>
        <P>There is a process for new members to join the social partnership. I pointed this out before. I am unsure of the environmental end. What has hap<Col N="1608"/>pened to date is that the NGOs have worked through Comhar, the national sustainable development partnership. That has been the appropriate forum through which environmental organisations with the social partnerships are engaged in the promotion of sustainable development. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has in recent years built up a good relationship with the NGOs and has given them funding. It is a closed group, with about 20 organisations listed. Comhar is also represented on the environmental co-ordinating committee, which was established to co-ordinate environmental policies with regard to issues arising across Departments and under the national development plan and the Community Support Framework. The environmental NGOs are also represented separately on this committee through An Taisce. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government works closely with a variety of environmental NGOs on other issues. I understand the question of representation for environmental NGOs in the formal structures of partnership has been discussed in Comhar. I have received no formal response from these organisations on joint partnership.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A process is there which allows anyone to present his or her case. It is considered within the existing structures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not blocked any of them. Some people come in, others leave. There is a structure between the organisations. I do not get involved with who is in or out of the fourth pillar. While working out the last social partnership agreement, about ten organisations left and about 15 came in. It was negotiated between the groups. I am not against that.</P>

	<P>How will the Taoiseach respond to SIPTU, which if apparently not pulling out social partnership, has certainly opted to defer any decision to engage in negotiations for a new social contract and what are the implications of this, arising from the Irish Ferries decision?</P>

	<P>I am uncertain as to what SIPTU want us to do on this issue. It is currently before the Labour Court and will come before the Labour Relations Commission within the next few days. The process by which we had asked it to be dealt with is being followed. This has been ongoing for a long time and there are <Col N="1609"/>frustrations at all levels. The company can make quite a good case in terms of how long it has tried to negotiate. I do not agree with what it did, however. SIPTU has to deal with all of that as well. I am not clear if Jack O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s statement yesterday means that if he does not get a full resolution with Irish Ferries, which may not be in the hands of Government, social partnerships or the Labour Court, he will not continue as a social partner. I am not sure if that is his position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am unsure whether the Deputy heard what I have said on this idea of trying to find ways around problems and the generality of legislation. People involved in all sides of the seafaring business tell me that it is impossible to try to regulate this on an EU or Irish basis. They say that it is a global business and will not be regulated. The Spanish, Norwegians and others have tried this over the years but it is not possible. By means of industrial relations methods we have to try to deal with this problem as best we can. What was not acceptable were the actions of Irish Ferries last week. It is back on track now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Even if a new EU directive was there, it would not control this on an EU basis. Since last week, I have seen the companies involved at a European level, their flags of convenience and where their staffs come from. Subject to correction &mdash; or I will receive ten more letters from it &mdash; Irish Ferries was planning to register in Bermuda. Many other companies are registered outside the European Union. We have to resolve the issue but it will not be done simply by means of an EU directive on seafarers. That is what people on all sides of the industry tell me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased that Noreen, the wife of the late Liam Burke, as well as his sisters Mary and Kitty are in the distinguished visitors&rsquo; gallery today. They are welcome, although I know that it is an occasion tinged with a degree of nostalgia and sadness for them all. Generally, the public have a dim view of politicians and the amount of work they do. However, every time we come together in this House to pay tribute to a colleague who has passed on, it strikes me that there is one group of people who could disavow the public of that dim view and it is the family of the Deputy, sitting in the gallery to hear the tributes to a wife, a father, a husband or a mother. On this occasion, Noreen, his sisters and daughters, Catherine and Emma, will remember and know <Col N="1610"/>about the weekends when the telephone and the doorbell never stopped ringing and when Liam would have got up from Sunday lunch to take a quick call only to arrive home after midnight.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Liam Burke&rsquo;s family, no more than other families of political representatives, know all about the nights when one would not put a dog out in Churchfield in Gurranabraher but Liam Burke still went knocking door to door, and if he did not do Fairhill, he knew that the people there would give out. Therefore, on an occasion like this, it is the families in the gallery who are among our best witnesses.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to lead the tributes to former Deputy Liam Burke. Fine Gael learnt of Liam&rsquo;s death with great sadness. In losing him we lost a loyal colleague, a grassroots politician and a true friend, but the loss for his wife, Noreen, his daughters, Catherine and Emma, and his wider family is entirely different. Theirs is an essential loss. In losing him they lost a loving husband and a devoted father and I am sure the House joins with me in offering them our sincere sympathy.</P>
      <P>Liam Burke was a man of extraordinary kindness and generosity, a public servant, passionate about his people and, above all, a Corkman devoted to his city, which, as he liked to remind us constantly, was the real capital of Ireland.</P>
      <P>At his funeral I told a story about a father in Cork giving his son last minute advice as the young fellow set off on the big move to Dublin. The father sat his son down in the bar in Kent Station and said to him, in a Cork accent, &ldquo;Come here to me boy, it is like this, when you are up in Dublin in the pub do not go on and on all night about how you are from Cork. I know it is not fair boy but even though you are from Cork remember not everyone can be. So like a good young fellow, catch on to yourself and do not rub it in.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Everyone here would agree that was how Liam Burke was about Cork. Cork was his place. The men and women of Whitescross, Blackpool, Shandon Street and Cathedral Road were his people. With a sense of superiority, peculiar to Cork people, and with his sallow good looks that to the rest of us signify a certain breed of handsome Corkman, Liam Burke took the heart of politics, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the people of Cork by storm.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A high point in his career was his election as Lord Mayor of Cork. He put the heart crossways in a few people by threatening to resign over what he saw as a funding deficit of the Cork-Swansea ferry. Happily he stayed on when help came in the form a &pound;500,000. He was never easily dissuaded of anything. Liam Burke was a major player, a major personality in Cork politics and a colourful one.</P>
      <P>We pay our respects today to the politician who served Cork with passion and purpose for over five decades. Liam&rsquo;s career was inextricably <Col N="1611"/>linked with the political changes here and within Fianna F&aacute;il. Liam Burke may well have turned the tide for Fine Gael in the historic by-elections of 1979, which many people will remember, but in doing so he also marked the end of the tenure as Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F&aacute;il of another wonderful Corkman and Irish man, Jack Lynch. Within a month Liam Burke was in, Jack was out, Charles Haughey took over as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il and within 18 months Fine Gael was back in Government.</P>
      <P>Liam lived in interesting times and in many ways he created them. His contribution to those times and to politics generally was made even more extraordinary by his ability to experience defeat as well as victory with poise, grace and, above all, at times with his outrageous sense of humour. I suppose a sense of humour was essential in anyone who had had their heart bypassed ten times, as he was fond of telling people. He always took the job seriously but never himself.</P>
      <P>He served the people of Cork magnificently. In here he kept a low profile though when he intervened one could not ignore him. Many will remember in 1995 his speaking out after being subjected to abusive telephone calls for speaking out against drug pushers in Cork. &ldquo;You speak out publicly against these people and their trade at your peril, as I can personally attest&rdquo;, he told the House.</P>
      <P>In an honourable career spanning five decades, Liam Burke served in the D&aacute;il and in the Seanad under four Fine Gael leaders, Liam Cosgrave, Garret FitzGerald, Alan Dukes and John Bruton. In that time such was his likability and his canny ability that he became known lovingly as the Silver Fox and with good reason. As Cork public representatives will tell one, these abilities won him a seat in nine elections.</P>
      <P>At his funeral in Cork I said that in the Celtic tradition there is a great sense that the dead do not live very far away, that they are our nearest neighbours and that we can sense them. It is not simply that we can do so in his case, his family knows that for a fact. Judging by the tears and the general sadness at his funeral in Cork, there are thousands of people, friends, neighbours, hurlers and greyhound breeders who sense that also.</P>
      <P>Today, we honour Liam Burke, a husband, father, citizen, public servant, politician, parliamentarian, Fine Gaeler and Corkman. It is no coincidence that he saved up his leaving for the day of the official commemoration of the death of General Michael Collins at B&eacute;al na Blath in which he had a deep and abiding interest.</P>
      <P>He has swapped the D&aacute;il and politics for what Seamus Heaney calls &ldquo;[his] ... proper haunt, Somewhere, well out, beyond...&rdquo;. I thank Liam for his loyalty, courage and friendship. I am proud to have known him, to have understood his ways and to have travelled some of the road with <Col N="1612"/>him. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam gur ar dheis D&eacute; a bheas a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and on my own behalf to extend my deepest sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party on the death of Liam Burke. Like Deputy Kenny, I am delighted members of his family, his wife, Noreen and his sisters, Mary and Kitty, are here and I also extend our sympathies to his daughters, Emma and Catherine.</P>
      <P>I was lucky to know Liam very well and I shared many conversations with him. I found him an extremely likeable individual, always prepared to engage in the stories and banter of the House. He was a very kind man. Over the years when we were involved in various scrapes of one kind or another in politics, Liam was one of the people who would stop and talk to one about the issues in the corridor. As Deputy Kenny said, usually 20 seconds into the conversation the discussion focused on the Cork connection and viewpoint. He always seemed to me to be in good humour and good heart in this House. That attitude applies to some but not all people in this place, but Liam managed to always be that way.</P>
      <P>From his days with the Christian Brothers and university college he then served on Cork City Council for a long period from 1967 and was subsequently elected Lord Mayor. He was a Member of his House from the end of the 1960s, into the 1970s, 1980s and up to the 1990s. That is an enormously long period of service.</P>
      <P>The only thing that frightens me about what Deputy Kenny said about the 1979 by-election is that I remember it so well but it was 26 years ago. The story of it is for another day but that was a famous and important election and a great victory for Liam and a double victory for his party on that day. Liam also served in the Seanad and on behalf of Senators I wish to express that they also fondly remember him.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I agree with everything that has been said about his hard work in political life. Liam worked for his seat in an area where one had to work hard. He worked hard in a demanding constituency where the pressure of everyday issues was tough. There was no way to avoid putting in an enormous amount of effort at constituency level. His life was dedicated to his neighbours and community in Cork. He dearly loved everything to do with Cork and was so proud of it. He was very popular as Lord Mayor, an honour in recognition or a life of genuine public service. A party representative in this House can do no more than his or her best and I know that in his personal life Liam was a dedicated follower of sport all over Munster. He shared an interest in greyhounds with my late father and he was chairman of the Cork Dog Track. His great ambition, in which he <Col N="1613"/>was ultimately to succeed, was to win the Waterloo Cup. That is a remarkable feat for any Irish owner and I know he derived great satisfaction from it.</P>
      <P>Liam was also a great family man. It is a tribute to his memory that so many people held him in so much affection. I can speak for my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il in saying that his hard work was matched by the popularity he enjoyed among Members from every side in the House. He was a true gentleman and somebody whose company I enjoyed immensely. He is among the great figures who have graced this House over the years in terms of being a genuinely hard worker and a nice person. I join with Deputy Kenny and other Members of the House in extending our sympathies to Noreen. I am glad she is here, along with his daughters, Emma and Catherine. I extend the sympathies of the Fianna F&aacute;il party to his entire family. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm d&iacute;l&iacute;s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very sorry, on a personal basis, to hear of the passing of Liam Burke. On my own behalf and that of my Labour Party colleagues, I extend to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party our condolences. I join with the Taoiseach in offering our sympathies to his wife, Noreen, his daughters, Catherine and Emma and to his extended family. As has been said by both the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny, former Deputy Liam Burke was a very popular figure in this House. That is something that could not be said, perhaps, about some of the rest of us. I have never known anyone in the House who had an ill word to say about Liam Burke. That is an exceptional obituary at the end of such a very long period of service to his constituents in Cork.</P>
      <P>He was a very popular and colourful figure, a man of great decency and integrity. He particularly saw himself as being the representative of the second city, as the Taoiseach has said, and was very proud of his period as Lord Mayor of Cork. He gave very long service. He was a people&rsquo;s man and was especially popular in many areas where traditionally Fine Gael might not have been considered to have much support. Liam Burke was one of the exceptions to that rule, however. I was sorry, indeed, to see him resign from politics. He was one of the people that one misses in this House. On behalf of the Labour Party and myself I ask his family to accept our sincere sympathy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I extend my sympathy to the Fine Gael party and to the members of former Deputy Liam Burke&rsquo;s family, who are here today. I did not know him, but based on his reputation, I feel that I do. Certainly warm tributes have been paid to him on all sides of the House. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the fact that he apparently did not have an enemy in the House is a fine tribute to <Col N="1614"/>him as an individual and as a gentleman. The fact that he won nine elections is significant. As a novice who has only attempted one in my lifetime, I can hold him in the highest esteem. Politics was no easier when he started than it is today. One had to possess a certain degree of toughness and yet his universal popularity is a great credit to the man. I extend my sympathy to the family and his party. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm.</P>

	<P>Ar son an Comhaontas Glas ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhr&oacute;n a chur in i&uacute;l do Noreen, bean ch&eacute;ile Liam Burke, d&aacute; in&iacute;onacha, Emma agus Catherine, d&aacute; dheirfi&uacute;racha, Mary agus Kitty, a dhearth&aacute;ireacha, John agus Gerry agus an chlann ar fad.</P>
      <P>It is a shock, politically, for the Fine Gael Party and its leader, Deputy Kenny to lose a man of the standing of Liam Burke. On a personal level I did not know Liam well. However, any time that I met him I found him to be among the most charming and polite of individuals. It was always a pleasure to meet him. He was a man given to smiling and this is something I will always remember him for. Whatever the motive, he was always able to smile about it. That in itself was an endearing quality in a man who was not just kind but also statesmanlike at all times. He did good not just for Cork, but for politics overall. He portrayed politics in a courteous and statesmanlike manner and that reflects well on many people in public life. We owe a great debt of gratitude to him and his family, as do the people of Cork in particular.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As colleagues have said, I know he was great company on the train between Cork and Dublin and he will be sorely missed by many people. His funeral, indeed, bore testament to that. It is particularly sad, also, for a man who was, no doubt, looking forward to a longer retirement, that Liam is gone from us. In many ways, however, he leaves behind a legacy that is worthwhile. If he were here today, he would enjoy the tributes. They are all heartfelt and very genuine.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in D&aacute;il Members, I extend our sympathy to the widow and daughters of the late Deputy Liam Burke, to his sisters, brothers and the extended family on their great loss. I further extend our sympathy to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Members of the House who served with former Deputy Burke in the course of his many years of service both here and in other tiers of public life. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a ainm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, extend my sympathies to the Burke family, to Liam&rsquo;s wife, Noreen, his daughters, Catherine and Emma, his sisters, Kitty and Mary and his brothers, John and Gerry. As with the tributes from all sides of the House I can say that Liam Burke was a gentleman, first and <Col N="1615"/>foremost. The expressions of sympathy across the floor of the House serve to emphasise how popular he was in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but more importantly among his many friends and neighbours in Whites Cross, Glanmire and the entire north side of Cork city.</P>
      <P>He was a person who enjoyed life. He was great company and was a good colleague in the constituency as well. I certainly have learned a few tricks from him over the years. These were displayed in a very humorous manner. On many occasions at public meetings, for example, one could be under a great deal of pressure and Deputy Burke could feel sorry for one, take one under his wing and bail one out. That was something I appreciated very much.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Our families are related but the connection varied between uncle or fourth cousins, depending on who was writing the script. It was nice to have known and served with Liam, particular on Cork City Council where he took a passionate interest in everything that concerned his city. He was a great lover of sports, particularly greyhounds and coursing. The highlight of his sporting career, as the Taoiseach mentioned, was winning the Waterloo Cup with Henrietta. Celebrations went on for many a long night across the northside of Cork city. That probably rivalled the celebrations for his election victories. He was a doughty campaigner, epitomising honour and decency in politics.</P>
      <P>I express my sympathy and that of my family to Liam&rsquo;s wife and family, his many friends in White&rsquo;s Cross, the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party which includes many of his genuine friends, and the broader Fine Gael family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Noreen, Mary and Kitty to the House and extend my sympathy to them on the death of Liam. Liam Burke and I represented Cork North-Central together from 1981 to 2002, although he represented the constituency long before I was elected. In 1981, when I ran for the convention preceding the election of the same year, Liam gave me an opportunity to represent the Fine Gael Party. He had the votes at the convention and ensured I secured a nomination on the day, a decision for which I have always been grateful. Despite the rivalries that exist in multi-seat constituencies, Liam and I got on well and co-operated, although we had a few cross words from time to time. We were regarded as an effective team in the constituency and took the first two seats at the 1997 election, a tribute to the manner in which we worked as constituency colleagues.</P>
      <P>Although Liam officially retired in 2002 and was dogged by ill health, he devoted his attention to his great love of sport, particularly greyhound racing. As Deputies have noted, his victory with Henrietta in the Waterloo Cup was celebrated <Col N="1616"/>well beyond the north side of Cork. In Bantry recently, I learned that he and some friends had spent many nights celebrating in the town. I also believe the cup was brought to every pub and coursing club in Cork city and county in the months after the victory. Throughout this period, however, Liam suffered a great deal but his love of sport and the love of his family were a great consolation to him.</P>
      <P>There was another side to Liam which he never discussed and about which most people are not aware, namely, his great charitable work behind the scenes. From time to time, especially during the Christmas period, people would come to my clinic asking how they could contact Liam Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Deputy give him Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s telephone number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Through his contacts, Liam organised Christmas food parcels and supports which many people still require. He did not forget the people the economy left behind. The massive turnout at Liam&rsquo;s removal and funeral was a tribute to his popularity and the respect he earned through his efforts on behalf of the community. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I extend deepest sympathy to Noreen, Mary and Kitty, Noreen&rsquo;s daughters Catherine and Emma, and Liam&rsquo;s brothers, Gerry and John.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be associated with the words of sympathy to Noreen, Catherine, Emma, the extended family of Liam Burke and the Fine Gael Party. My first contact with Liam Burke was in 1967 when he stood for the Fine Gael Party in the north-west ward in Cork City. He subsequently moved to the north-east ward where he remained a public representative until he retired prior to the recent local elections. In 1979, when I stood for Cork City Council, he and I became good friends. Although we differed politically, we worked for people at local level. The saying, &ldquo;All politics is local&rdquo;, could be applied to Liam Burke whose interest in the local community was well documented. He served as Lord Mayor for the first six months of 1985, the year of the Cork 800 celebrations, and offered me helpful advice when I succeeded him for the second half of the year. I have very fond memories of my contacts with Liam Burke. I extend my sympathy to Noreen and to his extended family on this sad day for all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my sympathy and that of my family to Noreen, Mary and Kitty and to Liam&rsquo;s brothers and two daughters. Listening to the eloquent contributions about Liam does not give a full picture. Those of us who had to jump into the political arena with him know he was a tough politician, which was the reason he won nine elections. Those of us who participate in the <Col N="1617"/>political game must appreciate and admire his record. I hope, like Deputy Kelleher, that all of us learn something from Liam that could allow us to achieve something close to his great record.</P>
      <P>As soon as an election was over, Liam would tell other candidates the battle was over and it was time to work together because the crowd in Dublin would not know where Cork was if we did not tell them often enough. From then until the following election, he would give advice and make us laugh from time to time. He was a good politician but he was not all sweetness and light. He was also tough because those who wish to get involved in politics must have a tough edge. Liam had a multifaceted personality which made him well liked and respected.</P>
      <P>My family had a major difficulty because, as Liam&rsquo;s family will be aware, my brother-in-law is heavily involved in the greyhound industry and he and Liam were very close. As we all lived in Cork North-Central, we came to a pact under which half the family would vote for Liam and half for me. That is the way we split up the votes because knowing how close members of my extended family were to Liam, I could not possibly ask all of them to switch their votes to me.</P>
      <P>Liam in many ways epitomised what was good about Cork. I constantly hear people say he was always in good humour. Being from Cork, one cannot help but be in good humour. We have a saying in the city which stands to Liam better than most, namely, that there is a major difference between being well known and well liked. Liam Burke was both of these and his funeral, more than anything, taught us that. May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>On behalf of my wife Frances and three sons, I join Deputies&rsquo; expressions of sympathy and extend my condolences to Noreen and her daughters, Catherine and Emma. Liam Burke was, to say the least, a legend in Cork and in this House. I am not sure if it has been mentioned but we christened Liam Burke &ldquo;the silver fox&rdquo; many years ago because of his legendary wisdom and understanding and his ability to bring people of all sides together. As a member of Cork City Council, he displayed great wisdom and a profound knowledge of how local government worked.</P>
      <P>I became friendly with Liam Burke during a trip to Germany with the Leader of the Seanad and we developed a good understanding of each other. Deputies may not believe it but he once asked me to join the Fine Gael Party, albeit before I joined the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</P>

I will not say whether I did so, although I was not a member of Fianna F&aacute;il at the time. I very nearly joined Fine Gael but eventually decided to join the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. Liam gave lifelong service to the people of Cork and this country. May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>Having regard to the controversy that continues to recur about public expenditure decision making, can I ask the Taoiseach whether the Government is contemplating legislative or other changes in terms of the capacity to intervene in advance and assess a major public decision in respect of public expenditure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Right across the system there has been an enormous number of changes in how contracts are procured and how work is done. On legislation, there is the infrastructural Bill, which will speed up some of the issues. As far as the accountability and control of public expenditure is concerned, in the past few years there have been significant changes in addition to the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General, which are always implemented immediately.</P>

Is there any explanation as to why legislation, which the European Commission has been told is promised, does not appear, as far as I can see, on the list that we are being given? Who is being told fibs around here? Is it the European Commission or is it us? We should have the same list of legislation that is promised to the European Commission.</P>

	<P>Can I ask the Taoiseach if he saw the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme last night in which the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, defended the indefensible in explaining how the Government had done a sweetheart deal with the drinks industry so that it would regulate advertising?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am coming to the question. The result of such regulation is that the Government would pull the legislation that was in the last section, the alcohol products advertising Bill that would protect children and adolescents from overexposure to alcohol advertising. Considering the roasting the Minister of State and the Government got on this issue, will the Taoiseach restore that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for that is the Minister has successfully organised a voluntary scheme where we are now getting agreements with the industry on alcohol advertising and Department wishes to hold off the introduction of legislation pending the outcome of these voluntary agreements. For the first time ever, there is an active campaign by the drinks industry to promote sensible drinking habits and stop young people engaging in drinking. This is far more successful than any legislation.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am very pleased to introduce this Bill to the House. It is important and unique legislation. Social welfare legislation was consolidated on two previous occasions, 1981 and 1993. Since 1993, 18 Social Welfare Acts and a further eight miscellaneous Acts amending the provisions of the 1993 Act have been passed. Deputies will recall that the Social Welfare and Pensions Act which I brought forward and progressed through this House earlier this year contained a range of pre-consolidation amendments in preparation for the publication of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Social welfare primary legislation is currently contained in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, and 26 additional enactments. In view of the extent of the amendments effected during the past 12 years, I consider it appropriate that a further consolidation of the legislation be undertaken at this time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the consolidation Bill is to provide, in a single accessible document, the principles governing the application of the social welfare code, with regard to the social insurance fund, social insurance-based benefits, social assistance schemes, child benefit, the control and application of these schemes, and a number of other matters which come under the aegis of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>The social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, contains commitments to delivering quality public services and, in particular, to modernising laws and regulations. Consolidation is the traditional tool for making legislation more accessible and coherent. This Bill addresses my commitment to enhancing customer service and will go some considerable way to meeting my Department&rsquo;s commitments to regulatory reform.</P><Col N="1624"/>
      <P>The primary purpose of a consolidation initiative is to consolidate all the existing statute law on a particular subject matter. The only amendments to the Bill which are permissible in the course of its progression through the Oireachtas are those designed for the removal of ambiguities and inconsistencies, the substitution of modern for obsolete or inconvenient mechanisms or the achievement of uniformity of expression or adaptation of existing law and practice. In this regard, I propose to introduce a number of minor, mainly technical, amendments on Committee Stage to ensure that its contents are as up-to-date and relevant as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputies should note, however, that substantive amendments to the text of the Bill cannot be made in either House or a consolidation Bill cannot make any substantive amendments to the law. A consolidation Bill must be certified by the Attorney General to be a consolidating measure and this Bill has been so certified.</P>
      <P>The projected level of social welfare expenditure this year is more than &euro;12.25 billion, which is the highest ever and is indicative of the Government&rsquo;s priority to protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients. It is a clear demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities and their carers, children, older people, widowed persons, the unemployed, lone parents and many others who are disadvantaged. The budget for my Department is the largest spending allocation of any Department and for every &euro;3 that will be spent by the Government this year, almost &euro;l will go on social welfare entitlements.</P>
      <P>Every week, more than 960,000 welfare payment supports issue from my Department that directly benefit almost 1.5 million men, women and children. In addition, each month, more than 545,000 child benefit payments are made in respect of more than 1 million children. The statutory provisions underpinning the range of schemes from which this significant proportion of the population benefit should be as accessible as possible.</P>
      <P>Since the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, 18 Social Welfare Acts have been passed by the Oireachtas. These amending Acts have provided for major developments in the social welfare code. Significant enhancements over this period include a range of supports for carers, farmers, older people, lone parents, widows and widowers and people with disabilities. A programme of specific and targeted interventions, which has proven very successful, has been developed and implemented by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>The adoptive benefit scheme was introduced in 1995, and it provides for payment to an adopting mother or a single man who adopts a child. It is available to both employees and self-employed <Col N="1625"/>people who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions. It is payable for a continuous period of 16 weeks from the date of placement of the child and the rate is earnings-related. Some 40 beneficiaries claimed this benefit in 2004 at a cost of &euro;600,000.</P>
      <?oasys _dc14-?>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act 1996 enhanced existing provisions and further recognised the position of home makers in the social welfare code. It allowed for the disregard of certain periods of time, up to a maximum of 20 years, spent in the home as a home maker, for the purposes of establishing entitlement to old age contributory pension. The home maker must look after children aged up to 12 years or age or if over that age, the child or person being cared for must require full-time care and attention. To date, almost 14,000 people have registered as such with the Department.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced to enhance supports available for carers. Carers provide a valued and a valuable service. Everyone in this House and in society knows of the commitments and sacrifices involved. As Deputies will be aware, I am committed to the cause of carers and developments in this regard are of particular interest to me. The package of measures which, for example, I agreed with the Minister for Finance for 2005 commits additional spending of close to &euro;35 million to enhance supports for carers and to allow more carers qualify for entitlements. The respite care grant scheme was first provided for in the Social Welfare Act 1999. The annual grant, which is a payment to carers who look after certain persons in need of full-time care and attention, was increased from &euro;835 to &euro;l,000 in 2005. The grant scheme was also extended to include all carers providing full-time care, subject to certain employment-related conditions. Up to this year the grant was payable to any one carer in respect of a maximum of two care recipients, but with effect from June 2005 the grant is now payable in respect of each care recipient. This year to date, almost 29,000 persons have been paid the grant.</P>
      <P>Carer&rsquo;s benefit, which was first introduced in the Social Welfare Act 2000, provides a payment to insured persons who leave the workforce to care for a person or persons requiring full-time care and attention. I have provided this year for the enhancement of the scheme in two significant ways. I have increased the earnings threshold for carer&rsquo;s benefit recipients who work outside the home for up to ten hours per week by &euro;120 to &euro;270 per week. I have extended the entitlement to the payment to those who are in employment of 16 hours per week or 32 hours per fortnight for eight weeks, consecutive or otherwise, within the six-month period prior to the claim. The latter provision will help people with atypical work patterns to satisfy the qualifying conditions.</P>
      <P>The farm assist scheme, which was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1999, represented an <Col N="1626"/>important development in the provision of income support for farmers. The impetus for the scheme stemmed from the difficulties which were being experienced by low-income farmers at the time. The scheme has provided and will continue to provide a valuable support to small farmers whose incomes are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme allows for generous income and family disregards. Some 8,000 farmers benefit under the scheme. Expenditure on the scheme in 2004 was estimated to be approximately &euro;66 million.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act 2000 provided for the payment of special pensions to people who commenced insurable employment before 1953 but who failed the yearly average contribution test for qualification for old age contributory pension or who qualified for a minimum pension only. The pre-1953 pension scheme provides for the payment of the old age contributory pension if the claimant has attained pensionable age, was an insured contributor under the National Health Insurance Acts 1911 to 1952 and has a minimum of 260 paid contributions since he or she commenced insurable employment. The rate of pension payable is 50% of the maximum personal weekly rate of old age contributory pension, with corresponding payments for qualified adults and children where relevant. As a result of this enhancement, some 29,000 people receive the pension and an additional 4,500 people benefit as qualified adults or children.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act 2001 provided for the introduction of the island allowance scheme under which an additional weekly payment of &euro;12.70 is made to assist elderly people living on islands off the coast of Ireland who are in receipt of social welfare payments or corresponding payments from other EU countries. The scheme recognises that people living on islands which are not connected to the mainland face considerable extra expenses when availing of basic services such as hospital appointments simply because such services are not available to them locally. Such people must also provide for their own essential services, such as private electricity generation. Such services entail additional expenses which are a particular burden on people who are most vulnerable financially, such as the elderly. Almost 580 persons are in receipt of the allowance at present.</P>
      <P>The one-parent family payment scheme, which is an integrated scheme, was introduced in 1996. Under the scheme, payments are made to men and women who, for a variety of reasons, are bringing up at least one child without the support of a partner. A person is eligible to apply for payment under the scheme if he or she is unmarried, widowed without entitlement to a contributory widow or widower&rsquo;s pension, married to a prisoner, separated, divorced or if his or her marriage has been annulled and he or she no longer lives <Col N="1627"/>with his or her spouse. The payment is subject to a means test but has generous income disregards, particularly with regard to earnings and maintenance payments. If the means test limit is exceeded, payment at 50% of the rate continues for a further six months. Some 80,000 people are in receipt of the one-parent family payment.</P>
      <P>The widowed parent grant, which was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 2000, provides a once-off grant of &euro;2,700 to a newly widowed parent on the death of his or her spouse. The purpose of the grant is to help to alleviate the income support needs of widows and widowers with dependent children following the death of a spouse and to provide a cushion in the immediate aftermath of the bereavement, as the widower or widow adjusts to his or her situation. The payment is made by cheque. Some 1,380 widowed persons benefited from the grant in 2004.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act 1999 also introduced the bereavement grant, which replaced the death grant scheme. This grant, which is PRSI-based, is payable on the death of an insured person&rsquo;s close relative and is aimed at supporting the bereaved at a vulnerable time. The current rate of the grant is &euro;635 and was paid to more than 22,500 insured persons in 2004.</P>
      <P>The disability allowance scheme, which was introduced in 1996, replaced the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance scheme, which was administered by the health boards. It is a weekly payment made to people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66. It is subject to medical suitability and a means test. Almost 77,500 people are in receipt of disability allowance at present. Some &euro;544 million was spent on the scheme last year. As Deputies are aware, I introduced a significant enhancement to the scheme earlier this year. Disability allowance is not generally payable to a person who is residing in an institution. I provided in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 for the introduction of a means-tested payment of up to &euro;35 per week for persons excluded from the disability allowance scheme by virtue of their residence in an institution. The payment, effective from last June, is expected to benefit some 2,800 people.</P>
      <P>In addition to the range of schemes I have outlined, a number of significant cross-departmental initiatives have been provided for since the enactment of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. The introduction of a legislative basis for the personal public service number initiative is a good example. The Social Welfare Act 1998 established a framework for the development of an integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of publicly funded services. It formed a basis for the standardisation of the personal public service number system, the introduction of a public service card and the application of technology to cards to <Col N="1628"/>develop new methods of paying social welfare benefits via electronic means. The Act also facilitated the sharing of information between relevant agencies for the purpose of determining entitlement to and control of publicly funded schemes in particular.</P>
      <P>While the legislation provides that the bodies or agencies which can use the personal public service number as the key identifier may be specified by ministerial regulation, it is my practice to provide for such bodies or agencies via primary legislation. That is an indication of the level of importance attaching to this matter and the degree of care and consideration necessary to provide a means of secure access to a range of public services.</P>
      <P>Deputies will agree that the social welfare provisions which have been introduced over the past 12 years, of which I have outlined a sample, have had and will continue to have a significant and positive impact on the lives of thousands of people. The measures have significantly altered the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. As Deputies are aware, the consolidation Bill before the House, which is the largest to date, consists of 366 sections as well as various Schedules. It is of utmost importance that legal provisions which are of significance to such a large proportion of the population are accessible. Therefore, I intend to publish a guide to the Bill, when enacted, which will describe its provisions in as simple and straightforward a way as possible. While the guide will not be intended as a legal interpretation of the Bill, it will go a considerable way to assist the layperson in understanding what the Bill is about.</P>
      <P>I will briefly outline the structure of the Bill, which has 13 Parts. Part 1 contains the Short Title of the Bill and the necessary definitions of the terms used in it. It also contains the main provisions relating to the power to make regulations. Part 2 contains the provisions relating to social insurance. The chapters in this Part cover the social insurance fund, the insurability provisions relating to 2.6 million employees, self-employed persons, voluntary contributors and optional contributors. Part 2 also contains provisions in respect of the range of social insurance-based schemes, including short-term schemes such as disability benefit, maternity benefit, health and safety benefit, adoptive benefit, unemployment benefit, carer&rsquo;s benefit and occupational injuries benefit. It also provides for long-term schemes such as old age contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow and widower&rsquo;s contributory pension, orphan&rsquo;s contributory allowance and treatment benefit schemes. The provisions relating to the bereavement and widowed parent grants are also contained in this Part.</P><Col N="1629"/>
      <P>Part 3 contains the main provisions relating to the social assistance schemes of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, such as unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance, old age non-contributory pension, blind pension, widow and widower&rsquo;s non-contributory pension, orphan&rsquo;s pension, one-parent family payment, carer&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance and the farm assist scheme. The primary legislative provisions underpinning the supplementary welfare allowance schemes are also found in this Part of the Bill. Parts 4, 5 and 6 provide for payments under child benefit, respite care grant and family income supplement respectively. Part 7 provides for the continued payment of the qualified children scheme. Part 8 provides for the payment of island allowance to recipients of certain payments from EU member states.</P>
      <P>Part 9 contains the general provisions governing social welfare payments and insurability, including provisions relating to claims and payments, the appointment and duties of social welfare inspectors and provisions relating to offences, penalties and legal proceedings under the code. Part 10 contains provisions governing decisions and appeals in respect of social welfare and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Part 11 contains provisions governing overpayment, repayment and suspension of payments. Part 12 contains the provisions regarding liability to maintain the family and related measures such as payments under attachment of earnings orders. Part 13 contains the necessary provisions relating to the Bill&rsquo;s commencement, repeals and continuance.</P>
      <P>There are seven Schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 relates to employments, excepted employments and excepted self-employments for social insurance purposes. Schedule 2, which is in tabular format, sets out the range of social insurance benefit payment rates as provided for in Part 2. Schedule 3 contains the rules as to the calculation of means for social assistance schemes as provided for under Part 3. Schedule 4 sets out the range of social assistance payment rates. Schedule 5 contains the list of bodies specified to use the personal public service number as a unique identifier in accessing public services. Schedule 6 contains the provisions which have not, to date, been commenced. Schedule 7 contains the list of enactments it is proposed will be replaced by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I advise Deputies that following this Second Stage debate I will seek to have the Bill referred to a standing joint committee on consolidation bills, as provided for in Standing Orders. To assist the committee in its work, the Bill is prefixed by a memorandum, as required by Standing Orders, which shows the enactments it is proposed will be repealed and the sections of the Bill in which these enactments are reproduced. Deputies will appreciate that this is important legislation which makes the law on social welfare more accessible. <Col N="1630"/>The Bill, when enacted, will be of great benefit to the Members of the House and to everyone else with an interest in the area of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Counsel in the office of the Attorney General and the officials in my Department who have made a tremendous effort over many months to bring the Bill before us. The production of the Bill has taken an immense effort by a range of experts in the Department and legal services. In many ways it is not work that gets notice or headlines because it is consolidation work but it is very important to many people. I thank all those who worked hard, if quietly, over many years to produce this consolidation Bill. The last Social Welfare Consolidation Bill was produced in 1993 but today, in 2005, we are bringing up to date all social welfare legislation and consolidating it in one Bill. For that reason, I look forward to a constructive debate and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin my contribution where the Minister left off. I commend those who worked hard behind the scenes to produce the Bill. It is obvious the Minister did not do it all himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did very little of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The amount of work and detail involved is staggering. Everybody involved must have put in tremendous work over many months, as the Minister stated, and should be thanked. The work was done behind the scenes and is of a type that does not get headlines but is very important. It makes the complex social welfare system more accessible to all. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to produce a guide to the Bill. He stated he would bring forward amendments to change anomalies and simplify the language of the text, which is welcome. The simplification of the language in legislation has been called for by many people for many years. We need to move in that direction as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>This is a consolidation Bill. In one sense, it could be argued it is not supposed to do anything except to bring all legislative provisions together in one document. Over 12 years, much has been done by successive Governments but, as the Minister acknowledged, much more needs to be done. The main reason for a social welfare system is to support those who need support, such as those suffering from poverty &mdash; in a modern democracy that is how it should be &mdash; and to help people to help themselves. We are all aware of the problems that can be caused by poverty traps and we work hard to ensure that people are not trapped in poverty because of the provisions of a scheme the House might bring forward. We work to support people but we must accept there is an element of social engineering &mdash; a terrible term <Col N="1631"/>&mdash; in social welfare enactments to encourage people to help themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister brought forward the Bill and outlined what has happened in this regard in recent years. Much has happened. The economy has powered ahead, mainly due to the hard work of the people. If one drives at 6 a.m. one will see traffic everywhere due to the massive increase in the number of people travelling to work early. In the evenings, the traffic is also intense as people make their way home. This shows the high level of economic activity but also indicates the pressure on people in society to survive, rear their families and keep a roof over their heads. We live in a high-cost society. In such a society, the marginalised and the poor get left further behind.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency came before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs yesterday to make a presentation on its budget submission for 2006. I commend the agency for bringing its submission to the Houses of the Oireachtas and for making its announcement here rather than elsewhere. Ministers could take note of this and perhaps more announcements could be made in the Parliament rather than at press conferences on a Monday morning or Friday evening, when Members cannot be present.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency referred to the working poor. It stated that 9% of those in employment could be classified as working poor and gave a figure of 160,000 workers earning less than 60% of median income. This poses a major challenge. We must recognise that an issue needs to be addressed and that some people work extremely hard just to make ends meet but are not able to do so because they earn a very low income.</P>
      <P>We await the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on the family income supplement, an issue to which we have often referred. The Combat Poverty Agency claimed that family income supplement is only taken up by 50% of those entitled to do so and that the position is similar for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. The Minister referred to the bringing together of a number of these schemes, such as the child dependant allowance, the family income supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, in one second tier payment. He has an opportunity to achieve this in the upcoming Social Welfare Bill. We await the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
      <P>Members on this side of the House cannot do this. We can only state there is a need to ensure that those who depend on such payments get them. The methodologies of applying would put accountants off, never mind those who are already struggling to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads. I encourage the Minister to bring forward a system which ensures that those who are entitled to and need these supports get <Col N="1632"/>them, and to do so in a way that is simple to administer and does not require the filling out of acres of forms and does not have deadlines. For example, if one misses the deadline for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, one does not get it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Another issue I raised at yesterday&rsquo;s committee meeting and again on this morning&rsquo;s Order of Business of which I ask the Minister to take note and which is under his remit from the point of view of poverty is the administration of the education grants. I and my colleagues have encountered situations where people still have not got the money in June and July of the following year. Perhaps the Minister will bring this issue to Cabinet. Why, for instance, is it not possible for the calculations on the administration of the education grants to be carried out earlier in the year? The tax year finishes in December and the Department of Education and Science usually produces the scheme the following July and then the vocational education committees and the county councils must try to get their act together. There are seven months in which much work could be done.</P>
      <P>The reason I raise this is that it is quite possible that this area could end up in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It might not be a bad idea if it did because the Department already has much of the expertise and information which is being collected a second time by the VECs and county councils to support families which need it through this scheme. Perhaps the Minister will take that on board and suggest it to Cabinet. In fairness, the administration of schemes by his Department has improved immensely over the years. If any of us contact officials in the Department about an issue, they are very efficient in coming back to us with an answer which is how it should be. Education is one sure way out of poverty. Work is certainly important but education is more important.</P>
      <P>That leads us on to child and income poverty. We have debated how we measure poverty and so on but I think we all agree child poverty exists even today, as does consistent poverty which means people go without food. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other agencies are working hard and struggling to try to ensure families have something to eat and can heat their houses but they should not have to do that. Another challenge the Minister must face is dealing with child poverty. In fairness to him, he has said time and again that he is committed to dealing with this issue. He has talked the talk and the challenge in the coming months is to walk the walk. Let us see what the Minister will bring forward in the budget and the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency said yesterday that its study found that poor children were at triple risk of social exclusion from school, their <Col N="1633"/>peers and from social and cultural norms and that as well as the immediate social costs, child poverty generates long-term economic costs in terms of lower productivity, more unemployment and additional social provision. That is an area which must be tackled soon because there is no guarantee that the money will be in the coffers in the years ahead given the growth of other economies and the challenges our economy faces with the cost of oil, energy and so on. The Minister should consider the rising cost of energy which is impacting negatively on people who depend on the fuel allowance which has not been increased even though people pay much more for oil in particular. He should act in that regard soon because it is having an impact.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
      <P>The Minister referred to his commitment to carers. We are all committed to and laud and appreciate the work carers do. It has been argued that they save the Exchequer a fortune and we need to do more for them. The grant brought in last year was definitely a help but more needs to be done. We will support the Minister in anything he does to assist carers in their role.</P>
      <P>I bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the role of children who care. The Oireachtas committee, which my good colleague, Deputy Penrose, so ably chairs, has considered the role of children who care. The child caring for a parent who is ill must go to school, cope with education and return home in the evening and mind the parent or whoever is in the house. That is an area on which the Minister should focus to see if anything can be done to support children who are carers. The Carer&rsquo;s Association of Ireland has called for a national strategy for carers, which is not a bad idea. We should look at everything to see if we can come up with a strategy for caring. It is cross-departmental.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that perhaps money will be in short supply. We are all a bit concerned about what we see as money being wasted by the Government which could be used to help those who need support. I recall a number of months ago having a debate with the Minister about the back to education allowance. We debated the need to reduce the qualifying period which had been increased from six months to 15 months. The Minister brought it back to 12 months but we suggested bringing it back to nine months. I welcome the fact he did so recently, although it took quite a while.</P>
      <P>At the time of the debate the Minister admitted he could not change it because there was a shortage of money. Now we see that hundreds of millions of euro have been squandered by the Government, yet nobody is accountable. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs whose remit is to help those in poverty told us he did not have the money, yet his colleagues were squandering it willy nilly. Nobody is accountable <Col N="1634"/>for all this money which has been squandered. The Minister should ask questions about what is going on. He admitted he did not have the money to change the qualifying period but, thankfully, he eventually found it. Despite this, his colleagues were squandering money left, right and centre.</P>
      <P>I refer to the need to be aware of what is happening in rural Ireland. I spent three 12-hour days at the ploughing championships last week listening to farmers talk about the issues and problems they face, the fact their income continues to decline and the concerns they have about the future. The Minister referred to a number of schemes which assist farmers, and rightly so. However, the take-up of these schemes could be better, particularly the farm assist scheme which perhaps should be expanded because rural Ireland is getting an awful hammering. If the sugar beet industry is not supported and safeguarded by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, we will see many people in serious trouble. The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, knows that is a serious issue, particularly in the south of the country. I call on the Minister to look at that area.</P>
      <P>On many occasions the Minister has acknowledged the difficulties of the one-parent family scheme which he mentioned. I hope that in the coming weeks he will bring forward his long awaited, promised amendments to the scheme. We are not sure what they are yet but no doubt he will announce them in some newspaper and they will appear some Sunday morning. We will see the headline &ldquo;Brennan has new scheme&rdquo; or whatever instead of &ldquo;Brennan thinking or talking about new scheme&rdquo;. The Minister must have a hotline to the various Sunday newspapers because almost every Sunday morning, one sees headlines such as &ldquo;Minister thinks about this or that&rdquo;. One of these days we will see a headline that the Minister has done something. That will be a change. Perhaps some of the reporters might ask him what he is actually doing.</P>
      <P>The one-parent family scheme supports individuals rearing a child on their own, which is important. However, given the mechanics of the scheme, very often the partner cannot live in the house or else does so by sneaking in at night and leaving in the morning. The inspectors must keep an eye on this even though, as the Minister said on a number of occasions, it is not really their role. A mechanism must be found to tackle that and to see what can be done with this scheme.</P>
      <P>I refer to the school meals scheme. Several years ago there was an issue over the take-up of the school meals scheme. Will the Minister speak to his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, to ensure moneys made available for the scheme are used? We know how important breakfast clubs are and some years ago several agencies made a presentation on food poverty in <Col N="1635"/>Ireland to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. It is frightening to think that people in Ireland today are suffering from food poverty, particularly children going to school. From my many years in the classroom, I know if a child is hungry, he or she cannot function. Many families on low incomes cannot buy nutritious food. If a child&rsquo;s diet is poor and he or she is allowed to drink soft drinks and eat sweets, the child can become hyperactive in the classroom. This causes problems for teachers and I have some grey hairs that will testify to that. Other Ministers too need to examine this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome this consolidation Bill and agree with the notion of a guide for it. Having legislation in simple English is laudable. We look forward to amendments the Minister may introduce to make it more accessible. The Minister has been in office for a year in which he has issued many statements on his thinking. In a way he has generated debate on many issues which is laudable. We now wait to see what the Minister will bring forward after all his pondering and musing. I hope it will not be like the mountain groaning only to produce a mouse.</P>
      <P>The child care issue is one all Members are tackling. It is causing a major financial headache for many families and leading to poverty. Many parents must go to work and yet they are doing so to simply pay for child care. This area needs to be examined as we are behind the rest of Europe in the provision of quality child care. Recently I spoke to a young man in Dublin who told me the most stressful time in his life was when finding a childminder for his new-born son. He spent months searching for a quality childminder as his wife had to return to work because of the huge mortgage they were paying on a modest house in the capital. The Government must address these issues because families are at breaking point on it.</P>
      <P>What proposals will the Government bring forward for pensions? I am not happy with the idea of mandatory pensions which the Minister has suggested he will examine. This is an area one has to be careful about. However, at the same time we need a system whereby people will have adequate income in their old age. I do not believe making pensions mandatory is the way to go. When the Minister introduces his proposals, they will be debated hotly and heavily in the House and various experts will advise the social and family affairs committee. Demographics are changing at such a rate that it is hard to keep up with what is going on. With new people coming from other countries, the birth rate is growing. We have a situation where more people must work. Flexible working times also need to be examined.</P><Col N="1636"/>
      <P>It was rumoured the Minister would go to Europe. However, he has decided to look after the home turf for another while. He will not escape the musings and the schemes he has promised us. In the next six months we hope to see these come to fruition. I look forward to debating them with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment the Minister and his officials for bringing forward the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill 2005. There is a significant corpus of social welfare legislation, the Minister referred to 16 enactments, since 1993. This consolidation Bill is important from a lawyer&rsquo;s perspective as one will be able to go to one corpus of legislation and extract what is required. It is also important for the layperson to know his or her due entitlements. The Minister stated he will bring forward an explanatory memorandum to get around the need for reliance upon archaic language which bedevils all legislation brought to the House. Simplified and codified legislation is an extremely important aspect of ensuring the citizens for whom legislation is introduced have access and know its contents and the entitlements derived therefrom. In conveyancing law there is a requirement for archaic terms such as &ldquo;fee tail&rdquo; and &ldquo;fee farm grants&rdquo; that go back to feudal times. However, in social welfare legislation it is important to simplify its terms.</P>
      <P>This morning I examined the 2001 decision by Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly which gave the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs the legal basis to claim back moneys it was due beyond the six year statutory period which would be the normal contractual situation. I want to ensure people who may be due moneys from the Department are allowed to go back beyond this six year period. Sometimes the Department of Social and Family Affairs has a habit of pulling down the shutters to preclude people from their entitlements because of a cut-off period. A case concerning entitlements was brought to the Ombudsman who gave short shrift to the arguments made by the Department. I am often bemused that if one&rsquo;s application for a bereavement grant is beyond the six months specified time, one must give an explanation as to why it is late. Bloody hell, it is not the Department&rsquo;s business as to why it is late. If one is entitled to it, then that should be it. Cut out this erecting of a Berlin Wall around entitlements.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many people do not know their entitlements. I am shocked that in affluent Ireland, although we are still living in a level of poverty as we heard from the Combat Poverty Agency yesterday, a significant body does not know its exact entitlements. We have failed as legislators in ensuring the information is imparted. If an individual is due an entitlement back for six or more years, he or she must get it and be on a level playing pitch <Col N="1637"/>with the Department which received that power from Mr. Justice Niall Fennelly&rsquo;s judgment in 2001. While we cannot introduce amendments to consolidation Bills, in the forthcoming social welfare Bill I will pay particular attention to this area.</P>
      <P>Enactments laid down in a statutory framework bring certainty but can also introduce inflexibility and eliminate discretion. I wish to illustrate this with regard to a representation from a man in County Kerry regarding his entitlement to credited contribution in respect of his carer&rsquo;s allowance. He looks after his wife who has motor neurone disease. The Department informed him that to qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance credits, a person requires a paid and credited employment contribution that is reckonable for benefits, that is class A PRSI contributions, in either of the two complete contribution years immediately preceding the date of the award of the allowance. This individual is a self-employed person who has given up his employment to look after his wife. The Department informed him that regrettably, as his last PRSI contribution prior to the award of his carer&rsquo;s allowance was paid as a class S PRSI contribution, he does not qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance credits. Class S PRSI contributions refer to self-employment and are reckonable for contributory old age pension and contributory widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension but are not reckonable for benefits. Hence, someone who is in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance, who previously paid self-employed stamps, is not entitled to credits as a carer.</P>
      <P>We pay lip-service to carers. How much would it cost the State if that man sought to have his wife placed in an institution? I know from the experience of my wife&rsquo;s elderly great-aunt in Dublin that it can cost up to &euro;1,000 per week. In the midlands it costs between &euro;450 and &euro;600 per week. We should give people like that man the credits. We should salute a person like that and say &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant&rdquo;, to use a biblical quotation. He has adhered to the matrimonial commitment for better or for worse to the nth degree. He has left his self-employed job to look after her, for a carer&rsquo;s allowance of some &euro;150. Yet he does not get the credits because previously he only paid Class S1 PRSI contributions. That type of anomaly or rigidity and stupidity is what leads to someone being placed in an institution. Even though that option costs &euro;600 or &euro;1,000 per week, the carer&rsquo;s allowance only costs the State &euro;150. That individual saves the State an enormous amount, but we will not give him the credit.</P>
      <P>A former Fine Gael politician, who is no longer with us, used to claim that he was &ldquo;an idea a week&rdquo; person. The Minister is an &ldquo;idea every three days&rdquo; person. I grant him that. Compared with his predecessor, he does not seek photo <Col N="1638"/>opportunities. He does not cost us too much money in consultancy fees. Like me, he submits an old photograph and if it is accepted, it is good enough. Like the Minister, I do not overly mind whether my hair is combed. At least the Minister does not cost us too much money in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>He is forever youthful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true. If he dyed his hair it would look great.</P>
      <P>It is good that the Minister is innovative, has ideas and thinks out loud. Yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I paid tribute to the Combat Poverty Agency, as did Deputy Stanton. It was great to see the agency bring its report before the committee. Like us or lump us, we have been elected by the people. This is the sovereign Parliament of the Republic and Members are entitled to have such matters brought before them. The report has also been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention. We debated with the Combat Poverty Agency representatives and sometimes disagreed with them. It was not simply a love-in. The point of such meetings is that there should be tensions and good debates. It is not to pat one another on the back. At the same time, the fact that matters are brought before the joint committee and are debated is an acknowledgment that the primacy of the Oireachtas is important. The Minister&rsquo;s colleagues will let him know what transpired.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to another issue. Lately, I have spoken about the fuel allowance. I do not speak about matters lightly and am not an alarmist politician. That kind of politics did not get me elected, so I am not interested in it. However, when I feel strongly about an issue, I talk about it, although it may cost me votes. So be it. What about elderly people living in sheltered housing? One week before such people were due to receive their much needed fuel allowance, the Department of Social and Family Affairs notified them that it was being withdrawn from those who need it. This occurred when the weather was turning cold and on foot of a report from the British Meteorological Office stating this might be an especially cold winter. The allowance comes to &euro;9 per week and many elderly people were distressed. This issue applies to Dublin in particular and may also apply to people in Cork living in sheltered housing. It does not apply so much to people in rural areas. These people will not receive the &euro;9 fuel allowance, which came as a bombshell.</P>
      <P>This is a disgrace. Most of those people pay an additional &euro;6 per week because their fuel is provided as part of the local authority shelter. A sum of &euro;6 paid 52 times comes to &euro;312, while a sum of &euro;9 paid 29 times comes to &euro;261. This affects the Minister&rsquo;s constituency more than my <Col N="1639"/>own. In south-eastern Dublin, my colleague, Deputy Quinn, was extremely annoyed about it because it came as a bombshell to those people and to their elected representatives.</P>
      <P>Yet again, a sneaky question on a form was responsible. I continually return to the root of a problem and wonder what great intellect came up with it. The form asks whether the applicant lives in local authority accommodation with central heating provided. If one is in sheltered accommodation, some heat is provided. However, there is no such a thing as a free lunch as far as the service providers are concerned. The people in question pay an extra &euro;6. They used to receive &euro;9 for 29 weeks while they paid an extra &euro;6 for 52 weeks. They actually lost out.</P>
      <P>I ask that we take the bull by the horns and restore the allowance. Not many people are involved. I believe the Department is saving something like &euro;1,500 per week. That decision came from the Minister&rsquo;s Department. I believe the pension services office in Sligo was responsible. I have been informed that in the same week the notification arrived, the Department was trying to install three separate mobile telephone antennae on the roof of the pension services office in Sligo. I am sure the installations will generate some revenue.</P>
      <P>Sheltered housing is to be found in cities rather than rural areas. These people have made a valuable contribution and expect that we will at least look after them by providing them with some heat. This decision should be reversed immediately. I ask the Minister&rsquo;s officials to take careful note of this. It angers me considerably to see the Department behaving like Inspector Clouseau by making savings of a miserable few shillings from elderly people who have put their backs into this country. This leaves such people exposed.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance has not been increased since the beginning of 2002. As I stated, it currently stands at &euro;9 and does not cover the cost of a bag of coal. The recent dramatic rise in the cost of fuel means that &euro;9 is worth much less than it was two months ago. Home heating oil has increased by 21%, the cost of gas has increased by 25% and the price of electricity has also risen. I merely reiterate comments made by the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues. We must increase the fuel allowance in this budget. The Combat Poverty Agency made that point yesterday in its presentation to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. This must be done because it is extremely important. As Deputy Stanton noted yesterday, there are two ways of doing this. One can elongate the period of time or increase the amount. I favour increasing the amount.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they fully recognise the tax compliance risks that arise in the construction industry and have carried out an extensive programme of checks, audits and investigations in the construction industry in 2005.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have reorganised along regional lines with each revenue region containing a special compliance district specifically set up to combat evasion. During 2005, both mainstream revenue auditors and special compliance staff have carried out substantial investigations of tax evasion in the construction industry. The extent of these activities is evident from the following brief summary.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s east and south east region devoted 50% of its available audit resources to a special investigation of the construction industry. In the first half of the year, the region completed almost 500 audits of principal and subcontractors yielding approximately &euro;12 million so far. The region carried out a further 360 compliance checks, 37 site visits and 92 visits to subcontractors newly issued with C2 certificates. By the end of the year, this region alone will have completed over 1,000 construction audits, 800 compliance checks and 70 site visits.</P>
        <P>Similar activity is taking place throughout the country. The Dublin region&rsquo;s special compliance staff carried out 35 site visits and 1,650 compliance checks in the first six months of this year. Dublin also has a Revenue district dedicated specifically to dealing with high-risk construction industry cases. That district alone completed 80 audits so far this year with a yield of &euro;4.5 million in tax, interest and penalties. The Dublin region <Col N="1641"/>has undertaken intensive investigation of a number of high risk cases, and has developed a national relevant contracts tax monitoring group which tracks the activities of high-risk principal and subcontractors by working closely with every revenue district in the country.</P>
        <P>In the other Dublin Revenue districts a high level of construction industry related activity has also taken place in 2005. For example, one district alone,out of a total of six districts, has completed approximately 300 relevant contracts tax field audits in the first half of 2005.</P>
        <P>That story is replicated in Revenue&rsquo;s other regions. The south west region has undertaken an extensive programme of RCT audits and checks, and has also had an in-depth look at a range of infrastructure building projects. The Border, midlands and west region has conducted a wide-ranging programme of activity in the first half of the year. For example, its special compliance district completed nearly 70 site visits affecting 250 contractors, as well as over 130 covert surveillance operations aimed at gathering intelligence on possible evasion.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are now planning how to build on these activities in 2006. The construction industry will form a major part of Revenue&rsquo;s compliance and audit work in 2006. That work will take into account a risk analysis of the sector, which has been conducted recently. The introduction of a computer risk assessment system during 2006, covering all businesses, will help target further the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; anti-evasion work. This system will enable them to capitalise on the knowledge already gleaned on this sector.</P>
        <P>The Government provided the Revenue Commissioners with additional resources, including 400 staff in the audit and compliance area some few years ago. The Revenue Commissioners are taking steps to police the construction sector within their existing staffing complement by appropriate deployment of resources, effective real time initiatives on the ground and innovative exploitation of technology to assess and contain risk. If the Revenue Commissioners come to the conclusion that additional resources would be of practical benefit, whether in the form of staff or otherwise, they will make a case to me and I will assess it on its merits and respond appropriately.</P>
        <P>I am confident, therefore, that the Revenue Commissioners are alert to the emergence of new or increasing tax risks in the construction industry and that their 2006 audit and compliance work will focus on the sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Based on the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, it is hard to share the Minister&rsquo;s confidence that this issue is under control. In the report, the Comptroller and Auditor General took a small sample in the large cases division <Col N="1642"/>of the Fingal and Cavan/Monaghan districts. The report found that on the RCT system, 49% of contractors had submitted returns late, 12% had made no tax deductions where deductions clearly needed to be made, and returns were not all being examined because of pressure of work. There was also clear evidence of the continuing problem where people are being returned as sub-contractors even though they are employees, which is not an acceptable practice. Only 12 cases of fraud were uncovered and it seems that only person has suffered a penalty and that was a community service order.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>It strikes me that there is significant evidence of non-compliance. The building industry would probably raise between &euro;10 billion and &euro;12 billion in tax revenue, so non-compliance has major consequences for the Exchequer. It is not reassuring to find that the risk evaluation ordered by the Comptroller and Auditor General after his report in 2000 has not yet been examined by the Revenue Commissioners. While there are obviously builders and contractors who are abusing the system, there are many who are trying to be compliant. It makes it very hard for compliant builders to compete if others are actively engaged in non-compliance on the scale that the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report suggests.</P>
      </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners have been very successful in inculcating a compliance in this country, as tax collection has improved greatly and tax liability is being met responsibly by those who should bear it. The investigations undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners have also been very successful, but if they require further resources then they can put that case to me.</P>
        <P>The risk based approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners to audit and compliance interventions is now focusing on tax-payers that pose the highest risk. They have adopted a targeted sector wide approach to audit investigations and are conducting audits on higher risk cases. They have rebalanced their compliance measures by giving intense scrutiny to certain sectors where there are perceived risks, such as the construction industry. They have written to some tax-payers in the construction industry outlining their past experience of audit settlements in this sector and pointing out areas that give rise to underpayments of taxes, as well as inviting tax-payers to make corrections in advance of audits in that sector. They are not just looking at relevant construction tax issues in isolation, but are looking at cases as a whole, as there are other tax issues involved. This is part of the whole case management approach which they are developing to compliance interventions.</P>
        <P>The strategy to maximise identification of tax-payers has been through the setting up of the special compliance districts in the revenue <Col N="1643"/>regions, where the Revenue Commissioners have a focused approach to the gathering of intelligence and information on tax-payers at sectoral level. I have full confidence in them. If the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners wishes to speak to me about any further deployment of resources he is free to do so, and I am sure he will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Department attempted to quantify the cost of tax fraud in the building industry, especially in regard to RCT, but also the knock-on consequences for PRSI to which this is intimately linked? Has the Department attempted to quantify the risk? Would the Minister accept independent conservative assessments which suggest the risk and the loss to Revenue is in the region of &euro;200 million to &euro;400 million a year based on the value of the building industry?</P>
        <P>In the context of the answer the Minister just gave, does he believe that 35 site visits to contractors in the Dublin area is an adequate investigatory response to the level of non-compliance indicated in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report? The Comptroller and Auditor General stated that last year only 15,000 audits were carried out, of which 1,500 were in the building industry. The Minister indicated in his reply that even with enhanced resources for this year there is no significant increase in that figure. Given the value of the building industry referred to by Deputy Bruton, how is the Minister responding to the failure to protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests in collecting tax due from everyone in the building industry, and not just compliant builders who are obviously put at severe disadvantage by the fraud and scams that are prevalent?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that such practice is prevalent. The Revenue Commissioners have responsibility for administering and operating all taxes in the construction or any other industry and ensuring that all operators within that sector comply with their taxation obligations. They recently advanced a number of key developments that are having a significant impact on tax compliance, which I outlined in my reply.</P>
        <P>It is not simply a question of 35 site visits. To suggest that is the level of activity in the Dublin district of the Revenue in regard to the construction industry is to miss the point completely. There has been ongoing monitoring of this sector. For example in 1998 and 1999, in a major resource-intensive project the tax status of some 63,000 subcontractors was reviewed involving approximately 7,000 visits. The results of that exercise indicate that 88% of principal contractors visited had either correctly classified their employees or contractors or agreed to abide by Revenue&rsquo;s ruling as to the correct classification. They undertook a further programme of visits to <Col N="1644"/>142 construction sites during 2001 and 2002 to examine the employer-employee classification. In the sites visited, 2,998 individuals were classified as employees and 984 as subcontractors. Of the 984 subcontractors examined only 65 were found to be misclassified.</P>
        <P>On an ongoing basis based on risk assessment, Revenue auditors audit the books and records of a considerable number of contractors and subcontractors. The matter of employee and subcontractor status is always examined as a routine part of such audits. In each case the auditors examine the RCT1 forms that a principal contractor and a subcontractor complete in respect of each contract. These forms contain details of the duration and type of contract and a statement that the contracts are not contracts of employment.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Some 1,500 audits, 10% of all audits, were conducted on building contractors in 2004. There has been a substantial increase in the level of Revenue&rsquo;s activities around the construction industry this year, enhanced by a number of special new compliance initiatives. As I said, in the east and south-east region almost 50% of available audit resources have been devoted to a special investigation of construction industry projects. As part of that, in the first six months of this year, the status of some 500 subcontractors was examined and it was found that only three should properly have been classified as employees.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>In the Dublin region, a designated contact officer has been appointed to receive information from trade unions and others where there are suspicions that employees have been misclassified as subcontractors. Similar arrangements are being considered for the other regions. A national RCT monitoring group has been established with contacts in every district. That has proved highly successful in intensely monitoring and tracking suspect principals and subcontractors.</P>
        <P>On any fair analysis the Revenue Commissioners are doing everything they possibly can. They are bringing forward very pragmatic proposals which are working on the ground and they are liaising with others to make sure they deal with any misclassification that has taken place.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>the amount of current budget surplus on revenue accounts for each year from 1998 to 2004 in accordance with Irish and European accounting procedures; and the use to which these surpluses were put.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26931/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that when the Deputy mentions Irish and European accounting procedures, he is referring to the Exchequer accounts and the general Government accounts, respectively.</P>
        <P>The published finance accounts show that the Exchequer current account surpluses for the years 1998 to 2004 inclusive were as follows: 1998, &euro;2,649 million; 1999, &euro;4,367 million; 2000, &euro;6,971 million; 2001, &euro;4,724 million; 2002, &euro;5,400 million; 2003, &euro;4,410 million; and 2004, &euro;5,619 million.</P>
        <P>The general Government balance is a broader measure of the fiscal performance of Government. In addition to the Exchequer, it includes local authorities, non-commercial State sponsored bodies, the national pensions reserve fund and the social insurance fund. It also includes elements of accrual accounting while the Exchequer balance is a cash-based measure. On a general Government basis, the current account surplus for each of the years in question was: 1998, &euro;3,471 million; 1999, &euro;6,039 million; 2000, &euro;8,011 million; 2001, &euro;5,828 million, 2002, &euro;4,272 <Col N="1646"/>million; 2003, &euro;4,975 million; and 2004, &euro;6,713 million.</P>
        <P>The current surpluses on Exchequer account have been used to meet existing and future needs. For example, investment in capital infrastructure has been increased in recent years to around 5% of GNP per annum, twice the EU average. Capital expenditure is funded, in whole or in part, by current surpluses.</P>
        <P>The national pensions reserve fund, established in 2001, requires the statutory investment of 1% of GNP annually, to meet part of the escalating costs of social welfare and public service pensions. The current surpluses meet the cost of the 1% contribution. The surpluses are used to reduce the national debt, thereby freeing resources to fund other priority areas. Debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen to below 30%.</P>
        <P>The planned budgetary policy stance is to continue with our prudent management of the public finances and keep them in a sustainable position to ensure that room for manoeuvre exists to provide and enhance public services now and in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Minister has told us is that in the eight years since the Government is in office there is something like &euro;34 billion of a surplus on day-to-day spending. From what he said it is clear the vast majority of that is being spent on capital projects. Should we not prioritise human need over physical infrastructure? What is, in fact, happening with those large surpluses is that they are going to fund roads, bridges and broadband, and not to fund issues such as health, education and housing. Is it not the case that the most important infrastructure is a healthy and well educated population rather than roads and bridges? Should we not ensure that human needs services, such as health, education and housing services, which have been subject to under funding historically, are funded properly through the surplus? Is it not normal practice in any other European country to fund capital projects through borrowing? The surplus gained in the day-to-day running of the economy should be spent on funding the various human services to which I referred. Should we not stop regarding the funding of health, education and housing services, as distinct from roads, bridges and other forms of infrastructure, as a cost to the Exchequer? Rather, we should consider it as an investment in people.</P>
        <P>The considerable budget surplus, amounting to &euro;34 billion since 1998, would go a long way towards bringing us up to international levels. Where the funding of education is concerned, Ireland is 19th out of 26 OECD countries. The figure for second level education in particular is even worse, we are 21st out of 26. There is historic under funding in the health and social services. Should we not use the surplus to fund <Col N="1647"/>these services and engage in prudent borrowing to fund capital projects which we would be allowed to do under EU guidelines and legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There needs to be investment in health, education and social welfare and there also needs to be investment in housing, hospitals and roads.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question of how that is done and of where the money comes from.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. We are doing it more successfully than anybody else. The Deputy will have noted unprecedented rises in current spending on health, education and social welfare under this Administration. These rises are greater than any in the history of the State. Increases to pensioners under this Administration are greater than any others the Deputy will remember. The resources being made available under the current mix of policies are greater than they ever were. The Deputy suggests we should put at risk the ability to continue the economic activity that funds these resources so we can look after all our people. I do not agree with that economic philosophy, which the Deputy obviously holds.</P>
        <P>To increase the indebtedness of the country one can go to the people to seek support for doing so. Had the Government borrowed all the money the Deputy said we should have borrowed for capital purposes, or were he holding the reins of power, we would now have an interest bill amounting to approximately &euro;1.3 billion or &euro;1.4 billion more than it amounts to today, and therefore we would not have &euro;1.4 billion per year to spend on improved health, education and social welfare services on a sustainable basis. The Deputy is entitled to his opinions but I am here to defend very strongly the mix of policies the Government has provided over the past seven or eight years, which, on the basis of the figures on both the current and capital sides, led to unprecedented investment in all the areas he mentioned.</P>
        <P>We know exactly what we got for being highly indebted in the 1970s and 1980s, namely, high unemployment and high emigration. There are thousands of people in America, Australia and the United Kingdom who prove where that policy leads. It leads nowhere. Now that we have the ability to provide employment for our people, we must also remain prudent fiscally to ensure we can remain competitive, keep people in employment and give them a greater disposable income, and provide greater resources to meet all the social needs to which the Deputy alluded. We can now do so in a sustainable way which would not be possible if we adopted the Deputy&rsquo;s approach. His approach was tried and it failed.</P>

	<P>Is it not true that every other European country borrows for capital projects and that those projects serve generations of people, not just a single generation? Therefore, capital projects should be paid for over a number of generations through capital borrowing. Is the Minister saying he is successful in spite of the trolleys and MRSA in hospital wards, the 50,000 families on the waiting list for housing and Ireland&rsquo;s lying 19th out of 26 OECD countries in terms of spending on education? This is hardly a success story.</P>

        <Quest>the extra revenue generated per month for the Exchequer from the surge in energy prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The tax content on energy products may be made up of two elements, the excise content and the VAT content. Excise does not apply to all energy products although it applies to motor fuels and home heating oils. However, the rate of excise is fixed relative to the volume of fuel sold and therefore there is no increase in yield as the price increases. VAT is fixed as a percentage of price and, assuming consumption levels are maintained, increases in energy prices will result in additional VAT receipts from the energy sector.</P>
        <P>It should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is reallocated to motor fuels and away from other VAT-liable spending and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer as a result of any additional revenue that may accrue from motor fuels.</P><Col N="1649"/>
        <P>Given those qualifications, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated additional revenue generated for petrol and diesel for each of the first eight months of 2005 ranged from zero to &euro;5.4 million as the prices increased. This figure relates to petrol and diesel only because monthly data are not available for other energy products.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>If I pull in for my petrol on the way home and spend &euro;20 thereon, &euro;13 of that &euro;20 will go to the Exchequer as excise duty or VAT. If I pull in for &euro;20 of diesel, &euro;12 will go to the Exchequer. I do not suppose the Minister is pulling in to the pumps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The price has increased from approximately 80 cent per litre to &euro;1.12 per litre, and even to &euro;1.20 a couple of weeks ago. Is there not a considerable windfall tax accruing to the Exchequer by virtue of the increased cost of fuel? Ireland as an island nation is very susceptible as a consequence, because the freight sector depends on affordable fuel to remain competitive. There is great additional burden on the freight sector involved with exports out of Ireland. Let us not forget that in the past two years during which time Deputy Cowen has been Minister for Finance, the export sector has experienced the two worst years of the past 20. Therefore, is it not important that we keep the sector competitive and do whatever we can to achieve this?</P>
        <P>Is it not true that the Minister is collecting from each household &euro;900 more than he had anticipated? Is it not time that he fed back some of the gains he is making to the taxpayer in the interest of competitiveness?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be few gains to the Exchequer because additional VAT receipts on energy may be offset by reduced expenditure elsewhere. That is the basic point I make to the Deputy. The unfortunate reality is that higher oil or energy prices can lead to a reduction in economic activity. Therefore, if one gains on one side, one loses on the other. People only have so much disposable income. The Deputy can take it from me <Col N="1650"/>that if one must pay more for one item, one cannot buy as much of another product.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister had an extra &euro;1 billion yesterday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a macro-economic fact that is not being challenged by anyone I know of. Reducing excise taxes to help with the current price pressures is not the magic solution that some might think. Excise only applies to motor fuels and home heating oils. It does not apply to natural gas or electricity. Excise rates are subject to an EU framework and the scope for reductions is therefore limited. However, I understand the pressures that these increases have created. This also generates better energy efficiency in terms of what people want to do. It promotes alternatives to conventional fossil fuels, an area which we must continue to explore. These are all issues that arise as a result of the fact that we are in a higher energy regime than was the case in the past. It is not true that we have had the two worst export years of the past 20. The rate of growth has slowed but we continue to export more, year on year, than we did before.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>In his opening remarks, the Minister said that increased costs would result in reduced economic activity. That is not borne out by yesterday&rsquo;s returns. The Government has taken &euro;1 billion more in taxes than it anticipated. If the Minister is saying that people are spending less because of additional fuel costs, that is not borne out by the returns and does not stand up. We have lost market share in terms of our exports over the past two years. There has not been the same level of growth. Market share is important to us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>My reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s supplementary question was in reference to energy taxes and fuel prices. Thankfully, due to the way this economy has been managed and people being able to take advantage of the opportunities that arise here and in the international economy, we have increased buoyancy in the economy. I am glad that is the case. I presume everyone welcomes that fact. Other parts of the tax system have not been as buoyant as we would have liked. One must look at the entire picture.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath emphasises the increase in VAT and the question of higher energy prices. I am explaining that, specifically with regard to higher energy prices, a sustained higher energy environment will impact on competitiveness, cost and world growth. Everyone acknowledges that. We have a mix of taxes and lower income tax. When a customer calls to a filling station and pays for petrol, he or she is also paying into a taxation regime which is much better than some of our competitors. These are realities. There is a mix in <Col N="1651"/>the taxation system which must deal with competitiveness in terms of job creation. We have created many jobs again this year. Central Statistics Office figures suggest almost 90,000, which is an extraordinary figure under the circumstances.</P>

        <Quest>if he has received a report from the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners on the monitoring the Chairman had been asked to undertake of the application of the current non-residency rules for tax purposes; if not, when he expects to receive the report; if he anticipates any changes in regard to non-residency status in the next Finance Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26620/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor the application of the current non-resident rules through examination of cases handled in the Revenue large cases division and to provide me with a report once this examination is complete. The Chairman has confirmed to me that this work is under way and that he will report to me as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the procedures adopted with regard to validating a claim to non-residence status depend on the circumstances in each case. The administration of the validation procedures is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and I am informed by them that these procedures are kept under review. I am, however, informed that the methods used to verify claims to non-residence include a range of tests and an intelligence dimension which for obvious reasons they do not publicise. In addition, the revenue has statutory powers to make all relevant inquiries concerning any aspect of tax returns, including claims to non-residence status. I am further informed that a number of audits are under way into claims to non-residence and that these audits will be a regular feature of the risk-based programmes operated by Revenue. In accordance with normal <Col N="1652"/>practice it is not appropriate for the Minister to comment on possible changes to tax in the run up to the annual budget and Finance Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister outlined his request of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor the application of the current non-residency rules. Was there any time limit to that request? From a management point of view, did the Minister ask the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to report within six months, for example? In most organisations, if a report is requested, an indication is given as to when it will be completed. How many people are we discussing in terms of the large cases division and the intelligence dimension of the examination by Revenue? Could the Minister clarify the Cinderella rule? Is it true that one may leave this jurisdiction just before midnight for an unspecified period which could consist of one day or 30 minutes and at midnight this absence counts as non-residence? The Revenue report referred to in earlier discussions indicates that some people pay no tax because they are non-resident for tax purposes, yet appear to live here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should be aware that the full residency rules were last updated in the Finance Act 1994 when Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour were in Government, following a comprehensive review of the matter by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance. She knows what the rules are and we have discussed them on a number of occasions. The 183-day rule which contributes to determining residence in Ireland is also a key rule in other countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The rules we have are in line with international practice. There is nothing unusual about that.</P>
        <P>I do not have details of particular cases. As I said in my reply, I spoke to the Chairman concerning the report. He said that they were satisfied with the way matters were progressing. I asked him to monitor the situation and to forward a report to me in due course when he has completed it and he said he would. I can talk to him again about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer the question? If a person who is non-resident for tax purposes departs this jurisdiction at one minute before midnight for an undetermined duration, does that count in terms of non-residency? I understand that to be a critical part of Revenue&rsquo;s intelligence examination of non-residents. The Minister talks about chatting to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, who will bring forward a report in due course. Does this entail two months or four years? Will the Minister indicate <Col N="1653"/>the numbers that Revenue has identified as falling within this category?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I think the Deputy already knows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to the courtesy of an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the Deputy is. If I had the information available, I would give it to her. As I have not, I undertake to provide it if possible. She will understand from previous replies that there is no collation system within Revenue which could provide her with that figure immediately. It is another issue when she asks me a question to which she knows I do not have the answer.</P>
        <P>In terms of the Cinderella rule, she is also aware from lengthy discussions on previous occasions that, by leaving before midnight, one is not deemed to have stayed in the country on that day. That is a well known fact which was agreed by Dick Spring in 1994, when Deputy Burton was a Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>May one return ten minutes later? Is the Minister confirming that one can simply be out of the jurisdiction for a short artificial period, which would mean that a coach and four is being driven through any normal understanding of the non-residency rules?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners never indicated to me that a coach and four is being pushed through the non-residency rules. He makes clear that this matter is being monitored carefully by Revenue&rsquo;s own intelligence systems. I told him that this matter had arisen in the D&aacute;il on previous occasions and asked him to forward me a report on the matter as soon as he possible can. I believe it will take a matter of months rather than years.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s attitude to plans of the EU tax Commissioner to deal with vehicle registration tax.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26662/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>While The European Commission has published a proposal for a directive on car taxes, nothing has been decided at this stage. The Commission proposal has not yet been discussed <Col N="1654"/>by all member states although these discussions will commence shortly.</P>
        <P>In essence, the Commission proposal supports the gradual abolition of registration taxes which it believes impact on the functioning of the Internal Market. However, the aim of the proposal is that such registration taxes would be replaced by circulation taxes which would have a CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> element.</P>
        <P>We are willing to enter into the debate with the European Commission and other member states of the EU about the merits or otherwise of this proposal. However, from our perspective, it must be said that VRT provides significant revenue to the Exchequer &mdash;&euro;946 million last year &mdash; which is used to fund vital public services. The collection of this tax is also very cost efficient, with the large majority of transactions now being on-line. In addition, its existence, while obviously not popular, has not impacted negatively on car sales in the State. Latest data show a 12% increase in new registrations to the end of September compared with the same period last year and strong sales are expected next year.</P>
        <P>We regard VRT as a national tax that falls within the national competence. The mix of taxes, their levels and rates are a matter for EU member states based on legitimate choices. As regards the balance of taxation, Ireland has prioritised tax reductions on income earned by employees in preference to other tax areas, and this policy has helped create record employment levels.</P>
        <P>While we are open to considering environmentally based tax measures, we again see this as an area for member states to decide themselves. Notwithstanding this point, I accept that the Commission in its proposal is attempting to design a structure which ideally would go some way towards incentivising behaviour that reduces carbon emissions and as discussions commence, we will be interested in the further views of the Commission in this area in conjunction with the views of other member states.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister gave quite a clever answer. I must admire his capacity to go a little bit of the road with everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike his usual stance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I can be reasonable at an early stage in discussions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>This tax adds 61% to the price of a car and a high cost to the price of commercial vehicles. The argument being put forward is that it is not the ownership but the use of vehicles that has damaging environmental effects. Will the Minister elaborate on his thinking on this tax measure? He has recited the argument for and against it. He thinks this tax is an easy way to gather revenue because the consumer is a soft tar<Col N="1655"/>get in the car market and as the market is booming he might as well roll in the money while he can. He is also saying there is merit in examining the possibility of putting in place a more sensible environmental structure.</P>
        <P>Taking a long-term view, does he agree that it is time Ireland recognised that extremely high rates of VRT are out of line, that we need to reduce them over a long period to ensure such a change does not disrupt public finances and that we need to examine a more environmentally sound basis for raising tax from the motor sector? Does he agree it is time to consider such a policy in more open terms rather than trying to avoid being committed to either side of the debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate taking the long-term view of looking to the third tenure of this Administration in case it upsets the Deputy opposite. In this regard, I can look to the longer term.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy involved as well? I did not realise that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s party might be talking to his party yet. It should keep that door open.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The point to be made in this regard is that this proposal is at an early stage. The Commission has an idea and, as Deputy Bruton knows from his ministerial experience, many a proposal has been put forward by the Commission on which it was difficult to maintain a consensus when subjected to the white fires of domestic politics in the Council of Ministers. I could take the easy road and suggest that we will consider this positively on the basis that I know it is not imminent, but rather than taking both sides of the argument I make the point firmly that VRT is an important part of our tax system in terms of what it raises in revenue for the country. We must take that into account in terms of the mix of policies we have, including reducing taxes and keeping taxes on employment low, because that is a strategic view we have taken which has proved successful in terms of attracting foreign direct investment, generating economic activity and creating jobs for our people, which historically it could be argued was the major challenge facing successive Governments since we gained independence.</P>
        <P>I listened this morning to some people who promote the interests of the car sector and they said that this proposal was imminent and asked why would we not begin to address this immediately. That is a narrow sectional view to take. I <Col N="1656"/>make the point clearly that this tax accounts for &euro;1 billion in revenue, it has that benefit and it has not affected, as Deputy Bruton said, people being able to own their own cars which people need for transport purposes.</P>
        <P>If the Commission has come forward with an idea that seems to be good and sends all the right signals, we should discuss it. However, I make it clear that if it is an attempt to harmonise taxes or bring the EU into an area of competence in regard to which we have carefully negotiated ourselves to a position where we retain our own competence, this is a fundamental issue. It is an issue I raised in regard to aviation fuel tax and one I will raise in regard to this and other areas where I consider a principle is being conceded which would have wider ramifications than simply the benign measure that has been suggested here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Government carried out a study on what would constitute a more environmental approach? We see a great number of what can only be described as mini tanks driving around areas in Dublin 4 where the roads, or their surfaces at any rate, would be in a much better state than those of the farm roads in Laoighis-Offaly. Has the Government undertaken a study on how we might take a more environmentally sensitive approach to this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We also have a few of those vehicles in our part of the country. Now that we are operating in a higher energy environment, the question of energy efficiency, the use of alternative fuels and securing greater efficiencies is something countries must consider now, as was discussed with ECOFIN. At an informal ECOFIN meeting held by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, in Manchester a few weeks ago, this issue came up for considerable discussion because of the ramifications of higher oil prices for the future. There is also a responsibility on car manufacturers and others, as the Deputy said. This morning I heard people who defend the car industry suggest that the CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> emissions from these newer vehicles are less than the level of emissions previously. They regard that as a plus.</P>
        <P>From our point in regard to this measure, we will carefully consider its ambit and scope. I set out in my reply a number of important considerations from this country&rsquo;s point of view as we seek to examine what way we can move the issue forward with the Commission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Thought should be given not only to reviewing VRT but to the wider reform of motor taxation. Despite the increase in figures the Minister cited, people should be encouraged to own cars, particularly because of the Government&rsquo;s policies in regard to public transport, but where the use of cars is avoidable, especially in urban <Col N="1657"/>areas where public transport should be available, that is where the focus of our taxation policy should be.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s earlier crack in regard to energy tax convinces me that he does not understand that tax measure. It is a tax per volume rather than an <i>ad valorem</i> tax. If the Minister did what the ERSI recommended and reduced VAT and excise duties, whenever an increase in inflation in fuel prices occurs, the tax would remain the same. One need only compare the idea of vehicle registration tax and annual registration tax to the approach in other jurisdictions where as much as possible the bias is placed on the usage of vehicles and not on engine capacity. It is placed more on the effect to which Deputy Burton referred, namely, the effect and weight of the vehicles as much as on access to public transport in communities. If that is not the approach taken, as the Minister said in his reply, vehicle registration tax only exists to give the impression that we are lowering other headline taxes such as corporation tax and personal income tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a discretionary tax in that respect. We are all open to environmental initiatives. If someone can think up a way whereby &euro;1 billion euro can be discarded, just like that, it would be interesting to know how the public services he or she wants can be maintained. We cannot have it every way. There are environmental initiatives to be looked at and we can look at this one. However, as Minister for Finance, I am entitled to make the point that there are revenue implications here which must be considered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 90 together.</P>
        <P>I would like to emphasise once again that the Government is committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme. This programme is a major undertaking involving the relocation of 10,300 civil and public servants, 60 <Col N="1658"/>Departments and offices and more than 56 different locations around the country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is probably one of the biggest infrastructural projects undertaken by the State in recent times.</P>
        <P>From the OPW&rsquo;s viewpoint there are two main aspects to the programme: the identification and procurement of suitable sites and the construction and fitting out of buildings on these sites. Overall, the programme of site identification and acquisition is progressing satisfactorily. To date, property acquisition negotiations have been completed or significantly advanced in 23 locations.</P>
        <P>In Athlone, the Curragh, Navan, Furbo and Sligo, OPW owned sites have been identified and will be used to accommodate decentralised offices. In Longford and Newcastlewest, sites have been acquired from the relevant local authorities. Privately owned sites have been purchased in Buncrana and Clonakilty. In Tullamore, the OPW has entered into an agreement to purchase an office block when it is completed in September 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>From whom?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Contracts for sale have been received in a further 11 locations including Carlow, Donegal, Dungarvan, Killarney, Knock, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Thurles, Tipperary, Carrick-on-Shannon and Thomastown. Other locations at which site acquisition is at an advanced stage are Cavan and Trim.</P>
        <P>The total purchase cost for the 18 non-OPW owned sites, together with the building in Tullamore, is estimated to reach &euro;35.7 million. Of this amount approximately &euro;13 million is in respect of sites acquired from local authorities and State agencies. The overall site acquisition cost of the entire decentralisation programme is expected to be in the region of &euro;75 million to &euro;100 million, excluding VAT.</P>
        <P>The average cost per acre to date is about &euro;430,000. The cost per acre ranges from &euro;65,000 in a rural location to &euro;3.8 million for a prime development site in a town centre location. The prices paid to date for sites are considered by the OPW to be in line with market prices. The OPW&rsquo;s decisions to acquire sites are based,<i> inter alia</i>, on professional valuation advice, which reflects the prevailing market conditions in the locations concerned. Factors which influence market conditions for sites in a particular location include zoning, accessibility, proximity to amenities, and the general supply of, and demand for developments sites. By end 2006, it is expected that permanent buildings will be available for <Col N="1659"/>occupation in four locations. These buildings, together with temporary space, which is being sourced in a number of locations for advance decentralisation groups, will provide accommodation for upwards of 1,000 civil servants by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>The OPW is continuing negotiations to secure sites and property solutions for the balance of locations involved in the programme and significant progress in this regard will be achieved over the coming months. In summary, I want to reiterate that the site acquisition programme is proceeding at a pace which will facilitate delivery of the decentralised office accommodation within the indicative timescales set out in the decentralisation implementation group&rsquo;s June 2005 report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State not consider an average cost of &euro;430,000 an acre for decentralised sites to be an extraordinary price? Is the Government intent on driving up land prices in the 53 decentralisation locations, with knock-on consequences for local businesses and indeed for young people trying to buy houses in those areas?</P>
        <P>The Minister has indicated that he now expects only 1,000 civil servants to be decentralised by the end of 2006. In a previous answer to me he indicated that only around 130 will be decentralised by the end of 2005. That indicates that to the end of 2005 decentralisation will have cost about &euro;230,000 in site costs per civil servant moved. Is this not turning out to be one of the most costly exercises in the history of the State? I do not want to hear about a hut in Ladd Lane being sold for an extraordinary price. If the Minister of State gets good prices, that does not mean that he can go on a drunken sailor&rsquo;s spree as regards buying land in decentralisation locations throughout the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the price I indicated, which was an average between &euro;60,000 and &euro;3.8 million, it reflects almost exactly the market situation. I recommend the Deputy to travel around the country to see what is happening in rural towns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State does not need to patronise me. Just as he knows about Dublin, I know a good deal about matters outside the capital. There is no need to patronise me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps she should be more up to date, as indicated by the fact that she is surprised by the figure of &euro;430,000. One of her Labour Party colleagues in the Seanad referred to the God-forsaken places down the country that some Departments are being sent to. I have not heard the Deputy withdraw that particular statement on behalf of her party. There is a vibrant property <Col N="1660"/>market in the country and it is important to note that the &euro;22.3 million we got for a one acre site in Dublin compared to the &euro;430,000 on average around the country still reflects very good value. There is further speculation that a site which we will be offering to the market shortly may make in the region of &euro;50 million per acre in Dublin. It is a matter of location, location, location. We have striven to get the very best locations for the decentralised offices. The &euro;430,000 accurately reflects the current market value of land throughout the provinces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A different controversial site, at Thornton, cost &euro;200,000 an acre. That was an extraordinary increase in land values. The Minister of State is basically celebrating driving up land values at 53 locations around Ireland. It is great for the landowners, the speculators, auctioneers and the people handling the legal deals because they are all on percentage cuts. What about the young couple trying to buy a house in an area or the local business person who is trying to compete with the prices that the Minister of State and his friends are artificially driving up? He is telling the House, in effect, that he is proud of inflating property values because he is mismanaging the decentralisation process so abjectly.</P>
        <P>How can he justify the movement of only 150 civil servants? Only 100 have gone so far and 50 more may go by the end of the year. By the end of next year, he has just told the House, 1,000 may have shifted at a total cost of up to &euro;40 million. Where is value for money for the poor old taxpayer in this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy mentioned the Thornton site, which comprised 150 acres within ten miles of O&rsquo;Connell Street, as recommended by experts, and bought for development. That was the market value of that particular site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The site next door sold for two-thirds of that amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions. I would like the opportunity to answer them. As regards the 150 civil servants that will be decentralised before the end of this year, those are people who have gone as advance groups. I cannot click my fingers and create buildings. Also, it is a voluntary scheme and we are involved in intense negotiations with the trade unions representing the civil servants and making progress.</P>

	<P>We are only going on what the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 9,000 have applied to go. A further 13,000 have applied to decentralise since <Col N="1661"/>the closing date of the early move, or since the end of September.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>He said there would be 1,000 by the end of 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be 1,000 by the end of 2006. I can go though the figures for 2007 because we have laid down indicative dates. As soon as the buildings are complete the people will be ready to move.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State confirming that only five of the 77 locations that were to be entirely moved by the end of 2006 will even have buildings available? There are only five locations, and only two, Tullamore and Sligo, will have any staff moved. Therefore the deadline set by the Minister as a critical test for Deputy Parlon&rsquo;s performance as Minister of State seems to have been totally abandoned.</P>
        <P>We have yet to hear about the building costs for the newly purchased sites. The Minister of State referred to &euro;75 million for the purchase of the sites and &euro;900 million for the total cost of moving. I examined the figures on decentralisation. Is it not the case that less than 10% of staff in the vast majority of the organisations designated for an early move have indicated a willingness to move? How will staff be moved with the haste intended by the Minister of State, as demonstrated by the building work already under way, if 90% of staff and in some cases more than 90% of skilled essential staff in the organisations in question have indicated they wish to remain in Dublin?</P>
        <P>Will the political ambition to be seen to deliver have a serious impact on the capacity of the organisations affected to deliver? This is an important issue which the Minister of State has never addressed. He has never told us what serious risk assessments have been done by the organisations on the impact of the move, particularly as so many people do not want to move and so many key skills will be lost as a result. The danger is that the next report of the Comptroller and Auditor General will state that while all the buildings have been constructed and sites acquired, the Departments were unable to move because no staff planning has been carried out.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that the Office of Public Works is in the process of buying 75 acres of land to accommodate the early movers and their 3,000 staff. How many square feet of property will be vacated in Dublin as a result? I presume this is how the State will secure a payback on its investment of &euro;900 million. How many sites will be vacated in Dublin and where are they? The Minister of State must provide this information given the revenue from vacated sites was held out as the <i>quid pro quo</i> for committing &euro;900 million to the decentralisation programme.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1662"/>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>In addition to property considerations, there are many positive reasons for taking the decentralisation route. The purpose of the programme is to promote essential balanced regional development. Given that the Government encourages incoming multinationals to locate throughout the country, there is no reason it should not put its money where its mouth is. Decentralisation will provide a massive impetus in this regard.</P>
        <P>To address an issue raised by Deputy Burton, thousands of civil servants spend hours commuting from towns and villages located within an 80 mile radius of Dublin. Decentralisation will offer them an immense opportunity to improve their lifestyles.</P>
        <P>The buildings for the first five candidates will be completed and staff will be at their desks in the five decentralised locations. The following tranche of buildings will be under construction and some of them will be semi-complete. I have provided indicative dates, all of which I can provide to the Deputies, but all the early movers will be finished by 2007. The term &ldquo;early movers&rdquo; is used for the first group of organisations because of the large number of staff who applied to move under the central applications facility and the availability of property solutions. There is no difficulty in this regard.</P>
        <P>This week, intense negotiations will take place between management in the Department of Finance and the IMPACT trade union, which represents the most difficult sector in terms of the professional grades involved. I have no doubt solutions will be found for all the human resources problems. Decentralisation is entirely voluntary and a commitment has been given that those who choose to remain in Dublin will have gainful employment and career opportunities. The programme will provide significant career opportunities to civil servants in place around the country and those who move outside Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that mean staff who do not move will not have career opportunities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State did not answer either of my questions. I asked about the fact that in the vast majority of the organisations affected, less than 10% of staff indicated a willingness to move. Will it transpire that, having committed to buildings and sites, insufficient staff will be available to run services in the new locations? What square footage is being vacated in Dublin? The Minister of State went off on a tangent instead of answering those questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier questions. As I stated, the decentralisation implementation group, an independent body chaired by Mr. Justice Fergus Flood, has indicated there will be no difficulty in terms of factors such as <Col N="1663"/>the loss of skills. The reason certain Departments have been included on the early mover list is that no difficulties are envisaged and a large number of staff have signed up for the programme. Those who applied may not come from the original Department. Staff are already switching Departments. For example, in the Office of Public Works several people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>How can we allow members of staff in a non-related Department or agency join the Health and Safety Authority as inspectors? We want the organisations affected to do their job effectively. We do not want to fit square pegs into round holes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Of the 10,600 civil servants affected by decentralisation, approximately 1,000 are specialist staff while the others are ordinary civil servants from various grades. Transfer to other Departments does not present a difficulty because civil servants currently transfer between Departments all the time. It will not impinge on efficiency by virtue of the fact that members of staff choose to move to a different Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should read the individual reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I anticipate that the ability of staff to work in a Department of their choice in a location close to where they live will have a positive impact on efficiency and eliminate the need to commute for five or six hours per day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>How much property will be vacated in Dublin?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the specific figure to hand but expensive, valuable property owned by the State will be vacated. In addition, the State will be in a position to surrender leases which are costing it substantial amounts of money. Property in Dublin 2 fetches the highest prices for lease or purchase in the State and, as such, the programme is positive from the point of view of property.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, to meet its additional accommodation requirements, the Oireachtas will make extensive use of the building which houses the Department of Agriculture and Food. Already, a substantial amount of office space in the building in question is being used by parliamentary assistants to Deputies. Approximately 130 members of staff at the Department of Agriculture and Food have already moved into temporary accommodation in Portlaoise in advance of the Department&rsquo;s new headquarters being built in the town. I note also that the Department of Health and Children recently decided to move out of Hawkins House tempor<Col N="1664"/>arily. Everyone agrees the building offers the most horrendous accommodation one could find for civil servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is moving to the north side of Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and a commitment has been given that the Department will move back to Marlborough House, the current headquarters of the Department of Education and Science, as soon as it moves to its new decentralised offices in Mullingar. A definite plan is in place and I assure Deputies it will work out positively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State send me the details I sought on the properties being vacated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will furnish the Deputy with all information available to the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated that thousands of civil servants will have moved by the end of 2006. Did he specify a figure of 3,000?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The actual number of posts within the five Departments in question is 555 but I expect, with the advance movements of other Departments, that the figure will increase to close to 2,000 by the end of 2006.</P>

        <Quest>if he will make a statement on his Department&rsquo;s recently published economic review and outlook for 2005.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26628/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As is usual my Department published the annual economic review and outlook, ERO, in mid-August. The economic forecasts for 2005 contained in the ERO were based on data to the end of July. The ERO forecast was broadly unchanged in overall terms from that published on budget day, with growth in real GDP again forecast at 5.1% and growth in GNP revised upwards slightly from 4.7% to 5%.</P>
        <P>The composition of the two forecasts, however, was different. The forecasts for domestic demand were significantly strengthened in the economic review and outlook. In particular, the forecasts for personal consumption and investment were increased as lead domestic demand indicators such as retail sales, tax revenues, etc. indicated the domestic economy was growing more strongly than anticipated on budget day. In addition, the projected increase in employment in 2005 was revised upwards on foot of strong data for the first quarter of the year. However, weaker than expected trade data and higher oil prices prompted a significant reduction in the forecast contribution from net exports. The forecast for <Col N="1665"/>growth in exports of goods and services was reduced from 7% to 3.9%. My Department will update the ERO view on budget day in December. Account will be taken of all published data since July when framing the budget day forecasts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister read recent commentary indicating that the economy is softening? A number of forecasters have suggested a revised figure for economic growth of 3.5% for this year. What would be the implications of such a development? Yesterday&rsquo;s Exchequer figures, for instance, showed an increase of approximately &euro;1 billion in VAT receipts, whereas revenue from corporation tax and income tax, once the special collections by the Revenue Commissioners are subtracted, is softening, particularly as regards the former. Has the Department carried out an analysis of the reason for the decline in corporation tax? What are the implications? While American multinationals are big players, what is the impact of the continuing strength of the dollar on the Irish economy, corporation tax outcomes, and employment in the multinational sector in this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy states, there are more downside factors coming into the equation on the international economic scene than would have been the case six months ago. The energy issue is certainly one of which people would be much aware. It is against a background of world trade growth, which is still strong when one looks at the emerging economies such as India, China and other Asian economies. The American economy continues to defy some of the odds, despite some downsides in terms of its imbalances, both fiscal and budgetary.</P>
        <P>The point we would make is that this situation must be managed. This country is achieving growth rates much higher than our European counterparts. Officially, there is recession in Italy. There are the difficulties of high unemployment in Germany and France. Compared to some of these European economies, one aspect that is different in Ireland is the strong domestic demand and that is a stronger component in our growth than would have been the case previously. It is good that we have that domestic demand. Indeed, the Achilles&rsquo; heel of the European economy is that they cannot generate any and that is having its effects on them in terms of higher unemployment &mdash; double our unemployment rate.</P>
        <P>This is an issue which must be managed. The Department does only two forecasts in the year, one in August and one on budget day. If we were doing one every month one would take into account developing data all the time. As I say, we must wait for the final quarter and see what is the final issue.</P><Col N="1666"/>
        <P>On corporation tax the trend evident all year has been one of just about meeting the profile. In some cases, it is down.</P>
        <P>On exports, we are seeing a reduction in the profile in terms of an increase, from 7% down to 3.9%. These are competitiveness issues of which we must be mindful and we must make sure, in the context of our social partnership talks and our policy responses to some of the higher energy environment issues arising, that we make the right choices. Unless we concentrate on increasing productivity and making sure we maintain our position in the international marketplace, we put at risk the volume of goods and services that we can provide which is the means by which we have generated the activity, created the revenues and created the jobs.</P>
        <P>While the macro-economic environment is good in Ireland, there is never any room for complacency. As I stated, the downside factors have increased. The international environment is getting a little more difficult. The European economy certainly needs to take some strategic decisions, structural reforms that would greatly help us given the shape, nature and destination of our exports. It is an issue we must manage and certainly we are conscious of that as we prepare our estimates and budgetary position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister comment on a concern of mine? Over a period a little longer than two years, exports growth rates have fallen from 15%-16% to 3% and the figures indicate that 40% of the extra employment has now been generated in the construction industry. The figures also indicate that in the housing market there is a significant volume of vacant houses. What worries me is that while our growth was driven traditionally by a strong export sector, with exports driving growth, we are now, as the Minister stated, in a position where construction is predominately driving growth. Is this a much more fragile basis on which to build our economic performance and must we be a little more concerned about the problems occurring in our export sectors?</P>
        <P>Employment in export industries has fallen consistently for nearly six &mdash; certainly five &mdash; years. The IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland stable of jobs is falling off quickly. Is this a serious issue, that we need to get back the balance between the development of these critical export sectors based on technology and productivity, and the construction industry which is now dominating the scene? Clearly there are limits to the construction industry&rsquo;s growth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This brief supplementary question relates to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s questions. Is the Minister concerned about what happened Hospira in Donegal? That multinational company made significant investments in plant in this country in <Col N="1667"/>recent times and yet pulled out at short notice with consequent enormous losses of jobs. Everyone must be concerned about the kind of marker that may indicate for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>In reply to Deputy Bruton, the components of the growth are changing all the time. We have an issue with manufacturing industry about which we must be mindful, both in terms of international mobile investment which continues to be strong and in terms of the strategy Enterprise Ireland is undertaking in building more successes in the SME sector and in building bigger Irish companies. There is a strategic framework in place.</P>
        <P>There is still a significant sector of our manufacturing industry which is low-paid, that is, between the minimum wage and the average industrial wage. There are a couple of hundred thousand people in the manufacturing sector from traditional industries which are with us since the 1970s and the 1980s, and much of our taxation policy has been geared towards trying to ensure that those industries are prolonged and remain with us for as long as possible. It points up the fact that there is no room for complacency. We all talk about building a knowledge economy. We must make sure that we take the necessary strategic decisions which enable that to happen to the greatest extent possible.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I stated, there is no complacency on this side of the House in terms of the challenges that continue to face us. Among the public and some commentators, there is a view that the economy is on automatic pilot and it does not matter who is in here at all. The fact is we need a strong handle on the economic management of the country and we must watch for the competitiveness issues. One of the challenges of the social partnership process and dialogue into which we are entering this winter is to ensure that we focus on the need for more productivity in the exposed sectors to which Deputy Bruton referred so that we can generate the revenues to continue with the improvements in public services that we all desire.</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Consolidation Bill 2005: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke earlier about the desirability of consolidating legislation into one Act, for everyone&rsquo;s ease and convenience, particularly consumers. Then I pointed out the anomalies which grow from that. I hope that the Minister <Col N="1669"/>would look at some of them, one of which is the fuel allowance, particularly for those living in sheltered accommodation. He can remedy that matter with approximately &euro;50,000, as I explained to his officials afterwards. The second anomaly relates to credits for carers, particularly those self-employed S1 contributors. That is an extremely important point because the Minister must recognise that caring is an important area.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to have taken a greater interest in caring but we must support the Carers Association. Mr. Enda Egan, its chief executive, has made a forthright and comprehensive presentation on a national strategy for carers, whereby all aspects of caring are examined in the broadest way. It must be underpinned by the legislative provisions that exist in Northern Ireland and England.</P>
      <P>I brought what I believe was a worthwhile Bill to that end before this House and it was not worthwhile just because it was introduced by the Opposition. Needs assessment in respect of caring is important. It is important to know the needs of the carer as well as those of the person being cared for, so that legislation is integrated. The Carers Association made a comprehensive and precise submission to the Committee on Social and Family Affairs in this regard. Change will not happen overnight, but we should make a good start.</P>
      <P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs has focused on the issue of carers and it will not go off our agenda as long as I am around. We should acknowledge that in the past caring has been provided on the cheap by carers who have done a tremendous job for us. This recognition is what they want. The monetary compensation, some &euro;150 odd, is only peanuts in the overall context for the 23,000 carers, only a few of whom get full carer&rsquo;s allowance. It is important we recognise fully the tremendous contribution they make, that we do not just utter platitudes but acknowledge carers through the necessary coherent strategy. The Minister should consider this.</P>
      <P Just="Left">People often come to our doorsteps expressing concern about widows and widowers under 66 years of age who are carers. For example, a person&rsquo;s partner often dies young &mdash; there was a funeral today of a young man 40 years old &mdash; and this leads to a reduction of up to 60% in income. This is a vulnerable time for the spouse who may be left at home with young children. We should examine the provision of a household benefits package for such people. When everything has been going well for a couple for some years and then in their mid or late 30s one partner dies and the other is left with young children, the surviving parent is very vulnerable. The wife may, for example, have been providing care to in-laws and have qualified for the carer&rsquo;s allowance. However, when she qualifies for the spouse&rsquo;s sur<Col N="1670"/>vivor pension, she loses the carer&rsquo;s allowance and no longer has her husband&rsquo;s full income. Her income is down by approximately two-thirds at this most vulnerable time. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended a carefully thought-out strategy in this regard and suggested widows or widowers should get 50% of the appropriate pension in recognition of their situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been doing some work with regard to the free travel concession for Irish people in Britain. There is a difficulty with this in the European Union context. We cannot be like ostriches, but must deal with reality. While the Minister is making an effort, he needs to accelerate his effort and formulate some policy to provide this concession for our emigrants. Deputies Stagg, Lynch and I, and other members of the Labour Party, visited emigrants in Britain last year. The Labour Party has done much work on this issue and was the first to introduce a debate in the House on the position and treatment of emigrants.</P>
      <P>Our emigrants want something tangible. It is no use coming in here full of piety and platitudes acknowledging the &euro;8 billion or &euro;10 billion they sent over to keep us. Our emigrants were the real foundation stone before the European Union was around to give us money. They were the bulwark on whom we depended for our survival and free travel would be a small acknowledgement in return. In the context of this debate on the consolidation of a wide range of legislation it is important this concession is introduced soon. We must ensure it is.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Stagg, has been very vocal on the importance of the extension of our television service into the homes of our emigrants in Britain. I was listening to a Ronan Collins programme recently and heard people ringing in from Britain. Many of our emigrants listen to Irish radio and it is an important contact point for them. RTE and the deflector system are issues for them. According to Deputy Stagg&rsquo;s information &mdash; this may test the will of people who may have turned somewhat greedy &mdash; it would only cost 15 cent a week extra on the licence to provide a service to Britain. Have we become so mean that we are not willing to pay that much extra on the licence to ensure our people in Britain get access to our television? Let us put the people to the test and explain to them the reason we want the extra money so that our emigrants get the opportunity to watch all-Ireland finals or whatever else they want. These people feel Irish and many of the programmes we do not bother about would mean much to them. If this is what is needed to ensure they are provided with a service, let us do it.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister has tried to do something in the area of the one-parent family payment. This is a difficult but important area. <Col N="1671"/>Changing one base may mean people in normal relationships are being penalised. The two areas must be examined together. I will not try to convey the impression that this will be easy. It will not.</P>

	<P>I am glad of that. When he got into this area he put on a bit of a socialist coat, although he was not like that when he was in the Department of Transport. Perhaps we converted him and clothed him when we got a hold of him. However, we did not manage that with his predecessor.</P>

	<P>She will always be remembered for the savage 16 cuts. The Department of Social and Family Affairs handed back &euro;840 million to the Exchequer over eight years. I would not mind if that happened as a result of savings. However, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor visited &euro;55 million worth of cuts on the most vulnerable people in the country at the time that money was being handed back. This is to her eternal shame. That record will be recalled in 2006, 2007 and the coming years. She let down the most marginalised people in the country. She told us she could not stand up to the Minister for Finance of the time, Mr. McCreevy. We tried to give her some backbone, but she failed the test.</P>
      <P>There are still huge problems with regard to the anomaly of rent allowance. I see Deputy Fleming is here. I am sure he is aware there is a different measure in Laois and Offaly than in Longford and Westmeath and that he has spoken to community welfare officers on this matter. Deputies are not elected without speaking to such people. People are asking why, in the name of God, rent allowance in Laois and Offaly is &euro;100 and in Westmeath and Longford it is &euro;10 less. This legislation is trying to bring a level playing pitch, to ensure the same interpretation, and to ensure that people are not disadvantaged because of their geographical location. However, the system in operation is different in regard to the rent allowance. It is important to deal with this area.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the family income supplement earlier. I understand he is examining child dependant allowance and working on a new extra child benefit. That is a good route to take. However, we must be honest. The Combat Poverty Agency made a very interesting observation yesterday about the skewing of the figures. It said the Minister will take a 25% hit if he takes the agency&rsquo;s <Col N="1672"/>advice about reducing the number of people. The agency&rsquo;s delegation spoke yesterday about the number of children living in poverty. If those comments had been made by representatives of the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Sinn F&eacute;in, or by Independent Members, the Minister would have jumped on them. The agency reported that 23% of the population, or more than 900,000 people, is living in income poverty. I refer in that case to the EU measure of income poverty. Some 9% of the population, or 375,000 people, are experiencing both income poverty and deprivation of basic necessities. In that case, I refer to the measure of consistent poverty used here.</P>
      <P>The figures given by the Combat Poverty Agency in respect of children are most worrying. According to the agency, 15% of children &mdash; twice the adult rate &mdash; are suffering from the most severe form of consistent poverty. Some 120,000 people under the age of 15, or the equivalent of 145,000 people under the age of 18, are deprived of basic necessities. I know the Minister has targeted the figure of 60,000. I would favour a target of between 60,000 and 90,000. That is the most important place. The Minister is aiming at the right target, broadly speaking. In relation to one-parent families, it has to be done and I will outline how it can be done. In the past, the Government has shown a fondness for individualisation, particularly in the tax code. It abhors individualisation in the social welfare code, however. In that instance, it prefers to treat everyone in the same lump, as the fellow says, because it saves the Government money to do so. When it was able to take tax moneys by means of individualisation and getting people out to work, it was a different thing.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the limitation rule, which prohibits families from claiming two unemployment benefit payments even if both adults satisfy the criteria for the payments, might be the best way to proceed. Many lone parents feel that the regulations which prevent them from cohabiting represent a restriction on their lifestyles. They are stopped from developing more stable family lives. Most people value the independent income that accrues to them from the social welfare payment provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I forget how many people are affected by this provision &mdash; perhaps the Minister mentioned a figure of 80,000 earlier. Such people are reluctant to become dependent on their partners for their economic security. A lone parent who wants to cohabit with a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance finds that the couple&rsquo;s combined weekly income decreases by approximately &euro;50. The two separate adult payments are reduced to a single combined payment, comprising one adult rate and one qualified adult rate. Both payments are made to the male partner.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem we face in the social welfare code is that we have an old-fashioned view. <Col N="1673"/>The code was introduced in the 1950s when the male half of a couple was the predominant breadwinner. The Minister has to try to overturn the perception within the social welfare code of the male as the overall breadwinner. That perception has not changed since the 1950s because everything is aimed at trying to get the qualified adult dependant rate to 70% and things like that. I am trying to deal with this difficult issue, with which the Minister is grappling. As I have said, I do not mind seeing the Minister&rsquo;s picture because I know he is not looking for consultants to put it in the newspaper. I read the Minister&rsquo;s ideas with interest, funnily enough. We all need to give the Minister a hand in that regard. The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs is willing to try to grapple and wrestle with this difficult problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about the habitual residence condition. As I hate to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, I will not say it to the Minister on this occasion. However, I am prepared to say &ldquo;I told your predecessor so&rdquo;. I understand the European Commission has put the Government in a tight hold in respect of the habitual residence condition. The records show that we warned the previous Minister that pressure would be applied at EU level. We told her that the predicted big influx would not happen &mdash; it has not happened &mdash; but she would not listen. Migrant workers suffer under the provisions of the habitual residence condition. The burden of proof falls on the applicants, who are assumed not to be habitually resident unless they can prove otherwise. The burden of proof is very high &mdash; one must prove that one intends to live in Ireland permanently. If one has a close family member living in another country, one is deemed to maintain habitual residency in that country. It is causing extreme hardship to people in dire circumstances. I refer to people who have lost their jobs, had accidents or become sick. Such events merit a response from our social protection system. A migrant worker who is not protected by the social insurance system because his or her employer has gained an exemption is refused any support from the State. We know about what has been done by some of the boys who have gained exemptions.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to act before he is forced to act. I remember warning his predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, that what has happened would happen. I will conclude by reminding the Minister that we are not all fools on this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The consolidation of any legislation is always to be welcomed. It should be under<Col N="1674"/>taken in far more areas. As Deputy Penrose has said, difficulties arise in the consolidation of legislation if there is in place a set of principles that subsequently proves to be difficult to adapt and modify without the introduction of new legislation. If one examines the trend that is developing as we commence the third consolidation of social welfare legislation, it seems that another dozen years will pass before we get a chance to consolidate it again.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we are setting in stone the principles which underpin the social welfare system. While we would like to pretend otherwise, it seems, unfortunately, that the system continues to be informed by the Victorian notion of the deserving poor. We categorise people and ask them to jump through hoops to justify their poverty and their degree of need. The Bill before the House represents an opportunity to introduce an entitlement-led system of social welfare, as we should have done before now. I favour a system that offers a safety net to people who have a temporary need for social welfare, rather than a system that places a social stigma on them.</P>
      <P>Thrusting capitalism is a feature of contemporary Irish society in the wake of the Celtic tiger. It is hard to determine the exact nature of the underlying philosophy of the Government of this era. It seems to move from favouring rampant capitalism to favouring socialism or social capitalism, which is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s preferred model of today. The values articulated in the writings of Professor Robert D. Putnam, the latest guru by whom the Taoiseach professes to put his store, are as far removed as possible from the basic tenets of our social welfare system.</P>
      <P>National and international organisations, including UNICEF and Barnardo&rsquo;s, have published statistics about the reality of poverty in Ireland today. The statistics suggest that the nature of our society is not as it should be. According to the ESRI, Ireland has a high level of relative poverty. I do not intend to start that debate with the Minister again, other than to state that many of our citizens are failing to maintain 50% or 60% of average income levels in their everyday circumstances. The ESRI has also stated that a tiny downward adjustment in Ireland&rsquo;s economic circumstances would lead to up to 400,000 of our citizens being exposed to relative poverty. Many of those people belong to vulnerable groups in society, such as senior citizens, the very young, women and people who are disabled. In such circumstances, we need to add something more appropriate than this Bill and the overall proposals emerging from the Minister and his colleagues to the general body of social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>As it strives to introduce real reform, I would have hoped the Government would have tried to eliminate the poverty traps caused by the welfare system itself. It is quite Dickensian that means <Col N="1675"/>testing, which is a crude mechanism, provides that a person who has one penny too much is happy and a person who has one penny too little is in misery. Many people&rsquo;s application for certain entitlements are refused because they are slightly above a means test level or their circumstances have changed. Why has the Government decided not to introduce staged or staggered payments? People should be able to receive 90%, 80% or 70% of the maximum payment if their circumstances change. We need such imaginative measures if people are to have confidence in the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a missed opportunity to integrate the social welfare system with the taxation system in the manner that is necessary. The Green Party has articulated the need for refundable tax credits to be used, where possible. It has indicated that such credits can be used to respond to difficulties in the child care system or to assist carers. They can be used imaginatively, even in areas we still depend on to meet most of our social services, such as in the declining use of volunteerism, for example. Yet, there has not been that type of innovative thinking a Department of its size and annual expenditure should bring forward when bringing about the type of change needed.</P>
      <P>There is a political cost to leaving open the question of whether social welfare payments can and should increase in any given annual Social Welfare Bill. The Minister would like to retain that power. The ability to introduce increases above the rate of inflation must be admitted for recent years but that will not be possible every year. I would like a situation whereby the consolidated legislation puts formulas in place so all social welfare payments would be index linked. I accept this can only be achieved when the Government comes close to meeting the national partnership recommendation that social welfare payments and State pensions should somehow be linked to the average household income, which it is still a long way from achieving.</P>
      <P>The issue of pensions is a major area the Minister has tried to address recently. However, given that this is a consolidated Bill drawn up following work with other Departments, it should have been clearer and more innovative. It is a scandal that the State pays more in deferred tax payments to people who are better off in their retirement years than is paid to those most in need of pensions because of their dependence on State pensions. I see nothing to suggest the Government is prepared to tackle this anomaly in the system. Not only has the economic success of the past ten years brought about a division between the very wealthy and those without in our society &mdash; those who cannot aspire to reach the average never mind the higher sums of wealth available &mdash; but Government policy is perpetrating inequality into <Col N="1676"/>the retirement years and until the eventual death of many of our citizens. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has a responsibility to tell his colleague at the Department of Finance before budget day and the subsequent Social Welfare Bill to begin tackling this anomaly because it cannot persist. Not only is it unfair, it is unsustainable in the long run, which the Minister realises.</P>
      <P Just="Left">My next point also refers to index linking but particularly to energy. The resumption of this debate was preceded by questions to the Minister for Finance, including on the ongoing concern about the rise in energy costs. Deputy Penrose referred to the fact the fuel allowance has been removed from people living in sheltered housing, which will have a detrimental effect. The fuel allowance has not increased since 2002 &mdash; a period of the highest fluctuation in fuel prices, which have risen by more than one-third. There is an onus on the Minister to address this matter in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill and the budget, if he has the opportunity.</P>
      <P>On a related matter, given that child dependant allowance has remained unchanged since 1994 &mdash; its existence is being set in concrete in this Bill &mdash; and given the tiny take-up of family income supplement, Government policies in regard to family support are failing, unfortunately. Not only is there a problem in that people who must work two jobs to pay high mortgages are not able to support their own families in the ideal situation on that end of the wealth scale, there is also a problem in that those who for other reasons choose to remain at home with children are offered the minimum of support from the State. There is a series of contradictions and missed opportunities which, unfortunately, this consolidation Bill is setting in stone. I hope these anomalies will not exist when the next consolidation Bill is before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It is an important debate because of its connection with welfare and poverty issues. It is also an opportunity for the House to reflect carefully on the direction our country and society is taking. When the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is used nowadays, it is often as a derogatory term or as if it is a dirty word. It is important to record that Deputies should always ensure that legislation looks after the weak in society. I say to those in economic and social circles who seem to have a problem dealing with the reality, that people in this society need our assistance and support and they should have it as a matter of right. We should not make any apologies for this.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister is present to listen carefully to the views of Members on the opposite side of the House. In particular, the Minister should target social welfare increases at tackling child poverty. Some 148,000 children need our <Col N="1677"/>help immediately and the Government should target resources at these needy people. The Minister should also target resources towards the elderly, who have served the wider community for many years, and on providing the back-up and support for people with disabilities, whether intellectual, physical or otherwise. It is important when discussing the Bill that we focus on these three main areas. With regard to child poverty, when Barnardos, the children&rsquo;s charity, begins its campaign in the next few weeks, it will be important that we listen to its views and conclusions and support it in the build-up to the budget.</P>
      <P>Many people in Irish society think that because we live in a very wealthy country, everybody is suddenly very well-off. That is not the reality. I remind the Minister that 52% of children in some disadvantaged estates on the north side of Dublin are not ready for primary school. The Minister, with the Minister for Education and Science, should declare war on educational disadvantage, beginning at the pre-school level. There is a major crisis in some areas of Dublin city and other areas of the country in that children are not ready for school. Children must live in homes where heating and dampness are still major issues while some 26% of children display significant problems of conduct before they start school &mdash; I refer to children from poor or dysfunctional families. Moreover, some 20% of children from some estates on the north side of Dublin have major eating difficulties and dietary problems while 31% are constantly missing school.</P>
      <P>This is where resources must be focused. I realise that others will demand that budget resources go in other directions but it is now time to act. The debate about the economy is over; the debate is now about how we distribute the fruits of the economy. Given that unemployment is low &mdash; a great achievement for any state &mdash; it is important we use the extra resources to assist and support these people.</P>
      <P>To move to the detail of the Bill, Part 9 contains the general provisions governing social welfare payments and insurability, including provisions relating to claims and payments, the appointment and duties of social welfare inspectors and provisions relating to offences, penalties and legal proceedings under the code, and the alienation of books and documents. Part 10 contains provisions governing decisions and appeals in respect of social welfare and the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. This Part also contains provisions governing the social welfare tribunal. These are important sections. When the Minister looks at the statistics and listens to the different lobby groups, I urge him to ensure he listens to the people who speak on behalf of the unemployed, poor, elderly and disabled.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1678"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister outlined that it was back in 1993 when the last Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill was initiated. I join with other Members who congratulated staff who pulled this Bill together. If it simplifies and helps people to understand their rights and entitlements in plain language without the legalese, then it will be a more than worthwhile piece of work. If it leads to the removal of anomalies in the system, then it will be more than worthwhile because we, as elected representatives, are usually left to try to sort through anomalies. In many cases, anomalies also highlight the unfairness of the system.</P>
      <P>I also welcome this Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill if it means a reduction in the bureaucracy faced by people trying to make or access a claim but I do not know if it will do so. Anyone who has ever claimed or tried to access social welfare will be familiar with the story of being sent from pillar to post and back again only to be told they had the wrong form or needed to get another one signed and stamped. I hope the streamlining of this legislation will result in an easier passage for those interacting with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am also concerned about the failure to take-up many benefits under the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and I have raised this issue with the Minister on a number of occasions. I do not know whether this is the appropriate area. I have spoken before about people having personal public service, PPS, and revenue and social insurance, RSI, numbers. A computerised system should be able to indicate when people are entitled to benefits. It is unfortunate that many people who are entitled to take up benefits are not aware of their entitlements. There is a 30% take-up of the family income supplement, so 70% are not taking it up. There are other areas where 20% to 25% fail to take-up their entitlements. If we are talking about consolidating legislation and moving things forward, we need to introduce a system to ensure people get their entitlements. There is controversy at present over new technology in the Health Service Executive, but it can be a positive way to move things forward and ensure people get their entitlements.</P>
      <P>I would like to think the Minister shares my view that root and branch reform is needed in various areas of social welfare. I look forward to seeing legislation on how he proposes to streamline the social welfare system which will reflect the needs and aspirations of those who have been left behind over the wealth-producing years. There is a need to respect the dignity of those forced to claim benefit. Why then in this era of new technology must people queue outside post offices in all weathers to collect their entitlements?</P><Col N="1679"/>
      <P>Many more substantive issues have been mentioned in this debate. There is the scandal of the paltry back to school clothing and footwear allowance for which not even all those on family income supplement qualify. This is a scandal when one thinks that the cost of sending a child to primary school is now &euro;357 and that it can be as high as &euro;547 for a student going to secondary school. When people on low incomes cannot even receive the paltry back to school clothing and footwear allowance, is it any wonder that the recent vocational education committee survey found that an area such as Rathmines has a 60% third level progression rate but that a working class area such as Finglas has a 7.8% rate?</P>
      <P>I support the call of the respected children&rsquo;s advocate, Barnardos, for an increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to &euro;150 for a younger child and &euro;200 for older children as an absolute minimum. I also call for an immediate increase in the income threshold for those who qualify for it. At present not all those on family income supplement qualify for the scheme. This puts a severe financial strain on those in low paid work, especially when it comes to sending a child to school. It is very unfair that the financial pressures on parents would have a negative impact on a child&rsquo;s education, yet the figures from the recent VEC report state exactly that.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to take action on the fuel allowance? A sum of &euro;12.30 would not heat a home for a single person, let alone a family. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties being experienced by recipients? Has he spoken to anyone trying to manage on social welfare? The price of fuel has rocketed due to various events and I assure the Minister that the ESB has acted accordingly with a 25% increase in the price of electricity. Will the Minister respond to this new reality for social welfare recipients? If he does not, even more people will be vulnerable to fuel poverty this winter, particularly the elderly and the young. Recently three homeless people died on the streets of Dublin. Do we want to see even more vulnerable people die in badly heated accommodation? I do not think so.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for a much more holistic and interdepartmental approach and for greater joined-up Government to tackle poverty and its causes. Some 77,000 children in this State go to school hungry. Will the Minister give a commitment to increase liaison with the Department of Education and Science to find new ways to address this growing crisis?</P>
      <P>As regards bringing people back into the workplace, the Minister will be well aware of the types of obstacles in people&rsquo;s way such as child care, finance and transport. Figures show that lone parents have much lower levels of educational attainment and it is a major factor in condemning <Col N="1680"/>those mothers and their children to a life of poverty and social welfare dependency. Surely the most effective way to address this and to ensure fewer people find themselves in that position in future is to increase the current levels of support for and investment in education schemes aimed at that group.</P>
      <P>A recent report on the social situation in the European Union identified one of the reasons for the poverty gap as a lower spend on job training, start-up schemes and programmes to integrate those with disabilities into the workforce. This State invests less than 2% of gross domestic product on such initiatives which does not lead me to believe that we are serious about reducing inequality.</P>
      <P>The statistics on access to third level education I quoted earlier show the role disadvantage plays in inequality. It is also clear that no one Department can deal with this problem. To this end, I ask the Minister for a commitment to support an initiative which will start next year. Atlantic Philanthropies has pledged half of the &euro;5.6 million needed to implement the project. It will look to the Minister&rsquo;s Department and others to make up the difference. The project involves monitoring 140 children from the estates of Darndale, Belcamp and Moatview. It is designed to maximise intervention from the appropriate bodies, one of which will be the Minister&rsquo;s Department, to identify problems before they occur and to prepare the children for school up to the age of five. I hope the Minister will support this scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to the promised legislation which will begin to address seriously the inequalities in society. Other speakers spoke about imagination and vision which are badly needed in this area, as is a fresh and innovative approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome this Bill. It is the first consolidation Bill in the area of social welfare since 1993 and collates the various Acts which have amended the 1993 Bill in the interim. The officials and framers of the Bill are to be complimented on bringing together in excess of 60 various social welfare enactments.</P>
      <P>Social services are for all of us and at any one time, more than 250,000 people rely on their help. Most of us at some stage in our lives may need to turn to social services for support, whether on our own behalf or that of a family member. In our practice of the profession of politics, we are constantly in communication with social services. We make necessary representations on behalf of persons suffering perceived injustices, perhaps owing to some insensitive administration of some social welfare schemes. Often people think the rules and regulations are designed to frustrate them and to do them out of their entitlements. We need only look at the guidelines for medical cards. If they were strictly implemented, possibly <Col N="1681"/>half the number of people with medical cards would have them. Were it not for the good sense of community welfare officers extending those guidelines, the numbers with medical cards would be greatly reduced. I note inconsistencies in the percentage of people with medical cards in different areas. If one examines counties with the same demography, the percentages of people holding medical cards should be the same. The Department of Social and Family Affairs must look at various systems for those counties not as well-off <i>per capita</i>. Some form of instruction must be given to community welfare officers to relax guidelines, which many people would welcome.</P>
      <P>Often representations will be made at a time of personal or family crisis, such as the onset of mental illness, the birth of a disabled child, a family break-up or a death which may leave people without the care on which they had come to rely. We all depend on good social services to be available at such times to help us make the right decisions and work out what needs to be done. More widely, we all benefit if social services provide good effective services to those who need them. Any society that purports to be decent must make provision for those who need support and are unable to look after or provide for themselves. One of the greatest tests of a civilised society is to see if it can look after those less well-off. Breakdowns in services for young offenders, homeless people or people with mental health problems can have damaging consequences not just for the individuals concerned but for whole family networks and others.</P>
      <P>Factors such as demographic changes, as well as changes in the patterns of family life, mean the need for social services will increase in coming years. With recent advances in health care, more people, including those with profound disabilities, will live longer. They rely on effective social services for more fulfilling lives. Social services do not just support a small number of social casualties but are an important part of the fabric of a caring society. It is everyone&rsquo;s concern that social services provide the best possible service.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately that objective is not being met despite some excellent service provision in many places with high appreciation by users. Social services often fail to provide the support people expect. In many cases, children and vulnerable adults have been exposed to neglect and abuse by the people who are supposed to care for them. Members will have read tragic stories in some of these cases, which makes very sad reading. Inspections by social services have found examples where protection systems have failed. This does not only include instances of abuse, but also children identified as at risk not being monitored by social services. Equally worrying are cases where people with learning disabilities or elderly people are neglected or mistreated, or live in intolerable housing conditions. Any decent <Col N="1682"/>society owes to every child a safe and secure upbringing, and to every elderly or disabled man or woman the right to live in dignity, free from fear of abuse.</P>
      <P>Regarding co-ordination, in many instances the various State agencies put more effort into arguing with each other over the administration of the schemes rather than looking after people in real need. I see this on a daily basis when, for example, seeking a disabled person&rsquo;s grant. The application is made to the health board which then sends it on to the county council. One is tossed about and at times it suits the various Departments and agencies to do this. While this is occurring, people are falling through the net. Often I make representations for individuals in their 90s for whom time is of the essence but they are put through the wringer. In some cases, they are trying to shoulder some of the caring the State should provide. Many elderly people want to live in their homes. They may have coped for several years but eventually it comes to the point where they must make an application for a downstairs bathroom. To be tossed about in such a way is grossly unfair.</P>
      <P>Frail elderly people can be sent home from hospital or do not receive the support or service they were promised and are entitled to expect. Many of these people are referred to, disrespectfully, as bed blockers. Services need to be developed for these cases, so as to free up hospital beds. If one has the ability to mind an elderly relative at home, people will choose to do so. However, many are forced to remain in limbo while different agencies argue about arranging the services required. There are numerous examples of poor co-ordination between local authority housing and social services.</P>
      <P>I welcome this consolidation Bill and hope it will remove the overuse of legal terms, making it more understandable and usable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first consolidation Bill in social welfare legislation since 1993. There have been umpteen Bills since then. It is important that there is one overall Bill that can be the reference point to which people can go to ensure they understand all available social welfare schemes. While this will be of major benefit to citizens&rsquo; information centres and advocacy groups, it will be of particular benefit to the staff in the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is important the information from this Bill is disseminated down the line in the Department to ensure a consistent understanding among social welfare officers of the various schemes available.</P>
      <P>In recent times, I have been disappointed in the measure of inconsistency in the decisions of deciding officers. I know of individual cases where if the deciding officer does not receive the information required, the file is closed and the payment refused. In many cases, it then goes to <Col N="1683"/>the appeals officer who grants the payment. While it is important to have an appeals system, I am disappointed by how many original decisions are overturned on appeal. One can either come to the conclusion that an appeals officer is right or wrong. If an appeals officer is right, it means the original deciding officer was wrong. I am upset by poor people in a tight situation having to wait several months before getting a decision. If an independent appeals officer can overturn a decision it means there was a basis to arriving at a different decision in the first place.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I dealt with a case that eventually went to the Ombudsman who was critical that different officers within the system could come to different decisions although the same facts and circumstances were presented to them. While we have consolidation of social welfare legislation, I want to see a consolidation of information to ensure it works for the people at local level.</P>
      <P>Since the last consolidation Bill, many new elements have come into the social welfare arena. Under Sustaining Progress, a commitment to make social welfare legislation available in a single and accessible document was made. Various Departments that introduce annual legislation must have a default system whereby when such legislation is passed it automatically is consolidated within existing legislation. For example, each annual Social Welfare Bill must be consolidated into existing legislation rather than simply having a merry-go-round and returning on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis every ten years to rectify the matter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">More than 1 million people benefit from social welfare on a weekly basis. The improvements which have been introduced since the last consolidation Bill include carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit, the farm assist scheme and another which I was very keen on and which I called the <i>pro rata</i> pension for old age pensioners. It affects those mainly self-employed people who did not have up to ten years of PRSI contributions. All Members have encountered cases of people with nine years and 51 weeks of contributions but who received nothing until that legislation was introduced, giving them a pension of 50%. They would like a pension of 99% but a pension of 50% is a major step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the introduction of other legislation in this area which attracted much criticism. That disappointed me. I refer to the pre-1953 pension which allowed people who had worked in earlier years to qualify for an old age pension. As their working career took place so long ago, their annual average contributions may not have qualified them for a pension under the traditional rules. Consequently, the Government introduced the pre-1953 pension. A total of 29,000 people now benefit from it which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>However, most of the debates in this House and in the committees about that scheme centred <Col N="1684"/>on its cost. People said it cost too much, the original estimate on budget day was one figure while the final outcome was a much greater figure. It demonstrated some begrudgery, mainly on the part of the Opposition, to the effect that this scheme was a waste of money because the estimates were wrong. It was stated that the Government got it wrong because the original estimate was X while the final cost per annum was Y. The hidden innuendo in that type of remark was that perhaps we should not pay that money in the first place.</P>

	<P>The Government should use its new HSE computer system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming"><NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point. Now the Opposition Members are trying to blame it on the computer system. However, that indirect innuendo is a dig at the recipients of the pre-1953 pensions. Every time a Deputy criticises the pre-1953 pension scheme in this House for whatever reason, he or she shows insufficient respect to the people who receive the pension and who are entitled to it. I ask Members to be more careful when they criticise such pensions in future and to think of the recipients. It is easy to have a cheap shot at the Government, which is fair enough. However, there are also other consequences.</P>
      <P>I want to see better integration dealt with by future consolidation legislation and in social welfare Bills. The House is dealing with consolidation today, but to me, integration is much more important. For example, if a person receives the old age pension and his or her spouse has a small pension, they lose the qualified adult allowance if the couple&rsquo;s income goes above a certain figure. This can have severe consequences. I encountered a case last week where a couple&rsquo;s income was over the threshold figure by &euro;1.52 per week because of income from a private pension scheme and consequently they lost &euro;16 from their qualified adult pension.</P>
      <P>Another area which requires integration is the handling of the farm retirement scheme by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food. I have had detailed correspondence with both Departments in an attempt to knock some heads together on this issue. However both Departments ultimately stated that each was responsible for administering its own schemes. As Members are aware, when a person is in receipt of the farm retirement scheme, when they reach the eligible age for receipt of the old age pension, their farm retirement scheme payment is automatically cut by the amount of the increase in the social welfare payment. As such individuals receive a payment from the State through two different Departments, they do not receive an increase in their net weekly income. While their old age pensions are <Col N="1685"/>increased, it is automatically deducted from the farm retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>I am trying to persuade the Ministers to bring the two sets of payments together. These people&rsquo;s pensions have been frozen for a number of years and it is not good enough for Departments to claim they are responsible for their own operations and that someone else should examine the issue. There should be joined-up thinking at Government level.</P>
      <P>Another example is when someone goes on family income supplement. By definition, they have a low income. What happens next? Their council rent rises. There is a lack of co-ordination and integration with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of some of these issues.</P>
      <P>These are some of the points which I want to see highlighted during this debate. While we discuss consolidating the legislation, I want greater clarity in respect of information within the Department of Social and Family Affairs so that decision making is consistent at all stages. Moreover, while joined-up Government between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and other Departments is difficult to achieve, it is important that it is done. This consolidation Bill will help us to concentrate on these topics. I hope the passage of the legislation will lead on to some of the points I have made.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to some comments made by Deputy Connolly a few minutes ago when he outlined the difficulties caused by running between the health board and the county council for essential repairs grants or disabled persons grants. One is sent from Billy to Jack and <i>vice versa</i>. The Deputy should ensure his local county council puts sufficient money in its estimates for the essential repairs grant. For example, County Laois is probably similar to County Monaghan in terms of size. Laois County Council pays out approximately &euro;2 million in essential repairs grants and disabled persons grants each year. Two thirds of the funds come from the Department, but the council must put up one third to draw down the rest. If a council does not do so, it will not receive money from the Department. Consequently, Deputies from these counties come to the House and whinge at a national level when the problem lies in their local council chambers and within the control of local politicians.</P>
      <P>This is not the Government&rsquo;s fault. I hear this complaint from representatives of other counties all the time. When one asks how much is provided at local level to draw down the central funds, one finds the local allocation to be miserable. The Government is expected to provide everything while they contribute little from their own estimates. If they did so, they would be taking better care of people at a local level and this House would not hear the hue and cry from Members in such counties. Some counties get <Col N="1686"/>allocations each year under this heading but do not draw them down because they do not put up their own matching funds. I wanted to put that on the record because I repeatedly hear that it is all the Government&rsquo;s fault. Much of the problem occurs at local level.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill and look forward to it passing through Committee, Report and Final Stages in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>I hope Deputy Fleming has his PRSI contributions paid up because the people will put some of the Government party Members on short time after the next general election. If he cannot see anything wrong with this Government, he should check that his social insurance stamps are up to date because he will need them. Mr. Flanagan will be elected in his constituency in the next election and the Deputy will be put to the sidelines. He does not even see where the Government is going wrong. This Government no longer knows the difference between right and wrong.</P>

	<P>The Minister should not make that mistake because that is the only income many <Col N="1687"/>women get into their hand. It is the only income they spend on children and I do not want it to be touched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>

	<P>I will increase it.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor broke a promise in 2001, so the Minister should make sure that it is increased to the promised level. The last time there was a downturn in the economy, child benefit was one of the first cutbacks. I will monitor this issue in December when the budget is published to ensure the Minister gives what he promised. I hope this will be done.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to examine another issue. It is a simple issue. I encountered an anomaly during the summer in respect of foster care involving four children. Their parents died of cancer within two years of each other. The four children applied for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme. I appealed on their behalf to the community welfare officer. Because they are exempt from the legislation, they are not entitled to avail of the back to school clothing and footwear scheme. This is a household without a mother and father and with four children. However, they do not qualify for this scheme. I ask the Minister on his return to his office this evening to sign an order permitting community welfare officers to pay foster children under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not use the excuse employed by the Health Service Executive which was that the non-payment is due to their existing payments. This is supposed to supplement existing payments for children when they return to school. I ask the Minister to deal with this matter immediately. It is an anomaly which must be dealt with quickly because there is no point in having a back to school clothing and footwear scheme when one has four orphaned children with only a young woman to look after them who do not qualify. I ask the Minister to deal with that, to get his officials to look at it and to sign the necessary regulations so that these people can be paid.</P>
      <P>Another issue I have come across recently has been that of lone parents. I hope when the Minister responds, he outlines how he might be able to do something for them, possibly by putting a scheme together so that lone parents may be able <Col N="1688"/>to live with their partners without losing their lone parent allowance. However, there is another anomaly in respect of young girls who have had children and who have gone back to education. This year I have encountered two such cases one involving a young girl of 17 who had a baby and wants to go back into full-time education. When she went to the community welfare officer looking for some assistance with rent allowance, the officer would not give it to her. If we are serious about poverty traps, then surely such a girl should be helped, as she wants to get back into education so that she and her child will not be dependent on social welfare for the rest of their lives. If such people do not get a bit of assistance, they will not be able to stay in the education system. The State will suffer as a result because these people will remain in the poverty trap, uneducated. At least they are trying now, by going back to college with a view to entering the workplace afterwards. I hope the Minister looks at these cases immediately. Due to regulations from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the community welfare officers have the right to make their own judgment in certain cases, but in these cases they claim it is due to legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment was suggested by Senators Ryan and Hayes and the Minister&rsquo;s change is to be welcomed. Unfortunately, <Col N="1689"/>that was not the case with many of the amendments moved on Committee Stage. While many of the amendments we are dealing with here today are technical or are amendments that clarify certain sections of the Bill, the Minister did not accept some of the more important aspects of the amendments submitted in the Seanad. In particular, there was one issue the Minister promised to examine and that was in the area of interpretation by the courts of laws and the methods used for interpretation. The point was strongly made in the Seanad that it should be indicated in the Bill that the courts may have the authority to examine the transcripts of the D&aacute;il, Seanad and committees when interpreting any particular section of a Bill. While it is not compulsory, it was felt that it should at least be mentioned in the Bill as a particular option. It is important that the conclusions arrived at by law makers are taken into consideration when such interpretations are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no objection to the amendment, but can the Minister explain why it has taken so long for this legislation to pass through the Houses? I also share the concern about the Oireachtas being paramount in terms of laws we make in this House. In interpreting the laws, the courts should give primacy to the intention in this House, as we are the voices of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>This is very much a technical Bill. Work is on-going in every parliament on the issue of how we interpret law. It is the kind of legislation that would not excite the public to any great extent. The Law Reform Commission produced a report on this issue and work has been on-going on the legislation for years.</P>
      <P>I will clarify the issues surrounding the interpretation of parliamentary debates. The Law Reform Commission produced a report entitled &ldquo;Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law&rdquo; in December 2000. The report recommended that in examining an Act, regard should be had to extrinsic aids such as D&aacute;il and Seanad debates. Senator Ryan proposed amendments which would have expressly allowed the courts to use debates of the Houses to assist in interpreting a Statute, but they were not accepted. Senator Ryan raised the matter on Committee Stage in the Seanad, was seconded by Senator Hayes and supported by Senator Quinn. I rejected the proposed amendment, which would have expressly authorised the courts to look at official reports of the debates, but I undertook to raise the matter in the D&aacute;il if I could do so procedurally. Subsequently, I wrote to Senator Ryan and advised him that, having investigated the matter, I found that I could not raise it in this House. However, the grounds for rejecting Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment still stand. It is felt <Col N="1690"/>that the courts, through case law, should be allowed to develop the principles within which extrinsic aids to interpretation can be used. There is a body of case law developing on this matter, both from within this jurisdiction and from others. To provide for aid on a statutory basis at this stage could result in the debates of this House and of the Seanad being used in a manner unintended.</P>
      <P>Chapter 5.09 of the Law Reform Commission states that in the context of using D&aacute;il and Seanad debates:</P>
      <P LI="1">More objections may be raised to the use of this type of extrinsic aid, than to the other types already discussed. This is principally because of the difficulty involved in distinguishing between the true intention of the legislature and the statements made by the government about that intention.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It should be noted that the courts can have recourse to extrinsic aid in the context of the interpretation of international treaties and most law originating from the European Union. This is necessary in the context of transnational matters for interpretation where other jurisdictions such as the continental European civil systems use extrinsic aids. It is felt that the Irish judiciary should be allowed to develop further the principles it applies to the use of extrinsic aids in respect of purely domestic legislation.</P>

    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="GerardMurphy"><NameTxt>Mr. G. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister acknowledged in his reply to the Senate that the courts are beginning a process whereby they will take the transcripts of both Houses into consideration in certain circumstances. However, for some reason, we in this House are reluctant even to suggest that they may do so. When Senator Ryan dealt with this issue, he clearly stated that there was no obligation on the Judiciary, but that we should at least acknowledge this process as part of the legislation we are now passing into law. It seems odd that the courts are already setting the precedent, yet we seem to be afraid to include it in a Bill that will act as a guideline for the overall interpretation of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment that was proposed in the Seanad would have expressly authorised the courts to look at the official reports of debates. The current position is that it does not prevent the courts from using debates of the D&aacute;il and Seanad. That was the advice I was given, which I am glad to share with the House. It does not prevent the courts from using and looking at debates of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>

	<P>These three amendments to section 18 are all technical drafting amendments to improve clarity. In the case of amendment No.24 the final phrase in paragraph (<i>d</i>), namely, &ldquo;whose adoption is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State;&rdquo; can logically only refer to a child adopted outside the State. The adoption of children under the Adoption Act is recognised by the State. This amendment ensures that the final phrase refers only to foreign adoptions recognised by the State.</P>

Subject to <i>section</i> 7, none of the following shall be taken to be part of the enactment or be construed or judicially noticed in relation to the construction or interpretation of the enactment:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">(i) a marginal note placed at the side, or a shoulder note placed at the beginning, of a section or other provision to indicate the subject, contents or effect of the section or provision,</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference in section 18(<i>g</i>), &ldquo;subject to <i>sections</i> 6 and 7&rdquo;, is inappropriate as only section 7 qualifies this section. The wording in paragraph (<i>g</i>) has also been rearranged for clarity. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to deal with any further developments in the layout of Bills that might be adopted by providing for shoulder notes.</P>
      <P>The amendment by the Seanad merely facilitates any change in layout that may be adopted in the future. No change in layout is required as a consequence of this amendment. For example, it will facilitate replacing marginal notes which are expressly referred to in this section with shoulder notes which are not at present dealt with in the text. In any event, it is now more common for large statutory instruments made by Ministers to have shoulder notes rather than marginal notes in cases where such a note is provided.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In section 18(1), the words the Seanad amendment deleted add nothing to the text. If an Act refers to another time zone, this will be clear from the context of the reference. This provision will not apply by virtue of section 4 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a brief question which also refers to the previous amendment in respect of the marginal and shoulder notes. The Minister of State spoke specifically in respect of legislation and statutory instruments, ministerial orders in particular. On the basis of a number of recent court decisions that have questioned the legitimacy of ministerial orders, will this change in the legislation prevent such decisions being made in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, it simply allows for possible changes decided by the House, bearing in mind that we are simply talking about the layout of legislation. I understand all legislation is included, including primary legislation and statutory instruments. It is to allow any changes in respect of shoulder notes and marginal notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it affect possible decisions such as those made recently by the courts on the proper application of ministerial orders? Did the decisions have to do with layout?</P>

	<P>This expresses more pertinently the concern I wanted to express earlier. There have been a number of court cases in recent years concerning the proper application of ministerial orders.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad I did not deal with section 28 of the Bill as passed by this House. Acts of the European Communities and European Union, normally directives and regulations but also the Treaty of the European Community, are often referred to in Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments. From time to time, these regulations and directives are revoked and made again with or without modification. The question arises as to what effect a revocation has on references in our Acts and statutory instruments to these European references. It was hoped that section 28, as passed by this House, would deal with this. However, most references are references to directives and the majority of these are given effect by ministerial regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972. The regulation making power in that Act is contained in section 3. In its application in a European directive, it is limited to giving effect to the directive. Section 3 of the Act states, &ldquo;may contain such incidental, supplementary and inconsequential provisions as appear to the Minister making the regulations to be necessary for the purpose of the regulations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If a replacing directive makes material modifications, as many of them do, to what has been provided by the directive being modified, and the directive being modified has been implemented by regulations made by a Minister under the 1972 Act, those ministerial regulations might not be capable of being kept alive simply by the device provided for by section 28 of the Bill. The scope of the regulation making power that the Minister concerned can exercise to give effect to the new directive could have increased or decreased in comparison with a corresponding power that was exercised to give effect to the replaced directive. On that basis, it is better to address this issue as it arises on a case by case basis, rather than providing generally for it in the Interpretation Bill. An attempt was being made to tidy up the legislation, especially in terms of primary legislation, but the advice is that it is better to deal with this type of situation on a case by case basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds like good advice. In a Bill such as this, making a generalised state<Col N="1701"/>ment concerning EU regulations and directives would seem to be taking a chance in terms of subsequent problems. While it is difficult to understand the advice given by the Minister of State on this matter, it appears to make more sense to deal with it on a case by case basis. There would be more clarity and assurance with regard to the legal translation of EU directives into Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of this is very technical. An example supplied by my officials concerned a directive on trout. If there was secondary legislation for this matter and Brussels decided to introduce a new directive on trout and salmon, new legislation would be necessary. It would be difficult to connect the two. We were trying to connect one directive with another but I was told that it is safer in such a situation to renew the earlier legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that European directives, if not implemented in national law on an EU law basis, became <i>de facto</i> national law anyway after two years. I am confused as to why this provision is needed. If EU directives are changed but no Irish legislation has been introduced within the two years, surely the EU law takes precedence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>This kind of effort to connect one piece of legislation with another would work in primary legislation. However, in terms of secondary legislation, the advice is that it is best to deal with issues on a case by case basis rather than provide generally for them in the Interpretation Bill. It is a matter of using language in our statute law which may be re-used. That is the background to this Interpretation Bill. That is why we propose to delete lines 22 to 30.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The additional words inserted by the Seanad are in the definition of &ldquo;year&rdquo; in the Interpretation Act 1937. They were not carried <Col N="1702"/>over into the Bill because a general provision was included in section 4 of the Bill providing that the proposed Act would apply except in so far as the contrary intention appears. However, the words when used without qualification in the definition of &ldquo;year&rdquo; in the Interpretation Act 1936 could also be regarded as having a technical meaning to others, known as a qualified year.</P>
      <P>A solar year, the time it takes for the earth to go around the sun once, may be classified as a qualified or an unqualified year. A qualified year relates to where the start and end points are expressed or otherwise ascertainable and an unqualified year relates to where it is equal to the solar cycle, which has no specified starting point. I hope this is clear to Members. When used without qualification, the year starts on 1 January of any year. It is no wonder that we need Interpretation Bills to deal with these issues. A qualified year means that the starting point is identified, such as from the present.</P>

      <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, pursuant to Standing Order 128(1), directs that the Railway Safety Bill 2001 in its entirety be recommitted to a Committee of the whole House.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am conscious that a lengthy period has elapsed since the select committee completed its examination of this Bill in 2003 and that many of the amendments tabled today did not arise directly from the debate in the select committee. Under Standing Orders, the Bill must be recommitted in respect of such items. Taking into account the significant new matters being introduced and the number of amendments involved, I consider it appropriate to recommit the Bill in its entirety for consideration today and I have proposed such a recommittal. It might be helpful for everybody to hold the debate in that atmosphere rather than Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not at all helpful. It had been my intention to propose a recommittal to Committee Stage at another date. The Minister is now merely discussing a procedural matter which shows no consideration for the importance of this legislation or the fact that people have received no notice of many substantial amendments. This is a shoddy and unprofessional way to conduct business in this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been in existence since 2001. It went through Committee Stage a full year ago. At that time, the Minister published 159 amendments which have been in existence for the past year. Last night, he published a further 17 pages of amendments, many of which amended his own earlier amendments. We received no notice of these. It is completely unwieldy and makes it impossible for us to keep track of his actions. It is entirely inconsiderate and another indication of the shoddy workmanship of his Department. He has a record of not following proper procedures. I object to the manner by which it is proposed to take this important legislation. There is no book of amendments and the number and grouping of amendments is inadequate. That makes it impossible to do business correctly in this House.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider what he is proposing. He should bear in mind that people need notice of what is proposed, time to read through proposed amendments and obtain legal advice in respect of them. The Minister has not allowed us that time. This is unacceptable and I object to his proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Shortall. The Bill was originally published in 2001 and withdrawn in 2003. We received Report Stage amendments to this Bill in October 2004. Those amendments were published again on 30 September 2005 and we received them earlier this week. This morning we received 17 pages of <Col N="1704"/>amendments to amendments. I was not spokesperson on transport when the original Bill was taken and, therefore, this Bill is new to me. I went to considerable trouble to understand the groupings of amendments. I was furnished last week with a list of the groupings of amendments and, on that basis, I prepared to deal with the Bill. I have now been handed another list of groupings of amendments which is different from and bears no relationship to the first list of such groupings. I am, therefore, not equipped to deal with this Bill. This treatment of the Oireachtas is unfair to the Opposition and to members of public because it makes the job of Opposition members, which is to analyse legislation, impossible.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Naughten, who originally dealt with the Bill on Second Stage, suggested when the first 52 pages of amendments were brought before the House that a new Bill should be published. I am of the view that this is the way to deal with the Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that everybody concerned is anxious that the Bill be passed but what has been presented to us is unsatisfactory. I speak for all Members on this side of the House when I say that we are ill-prepared to deal with these amendments. We have been handed a list of groupings of amendments that is different from the list we were given earlier in the week. We have two books of amendments, a green book and a white book and it is impossible to deal with both of them. Some day the Minister will be on this side of the Chamber&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the previous speakers. What is proposed is unacceptable. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of what is proposed. This legislation was published a number of years ago. We were told on Committee Stage that it had to be rushed through but then it appeared to go into a black hole for 12 months. We subsequently received a series of amendments and we received further amendments this morning. Will the Minister explain whether he knows what is happening regarding this Bill? No one has objections to considering amendments to a Bill that will improve it. It seems that the Minister and his Department are all over the place in regard to this legislation.</P>
      <P>We accept that legislation is needed and that what is proposed in the Bill should be done, sooner rather than later. I do not understand from where the Minister and his advisers are coming. The Minister might explain the delay in circulating these amendments. Perhaps he should consider deferring, even for a day or two, the tak<Col N="1705"/>ing of this Bill to give us an opportunity to consider some of the more substantive amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to add to what has been said by Deputies Shortall, Olivia Mitchell and Crowe. While I was briefed by the Minister&rsquo;s Department in terms of an indication of some of the changes proposed, I was unable to table amendments to the Bill in regard to the issue about which I was particularly concerned because I did not have a copy of what the Minister was proposing. It was difficult for me to amend Report Stage amendments that were only being tabled. All I knew about them was the intent of what was proposed.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the issue at stake or to be discussed is contentious politically. It is not an ideological divide that will frame a debate on the Bill. It is more important to err on the side of caution when dealing with a rail safety Bill and to ensure that it is dealt with in a manner that allows time for consideration. As an Opposition Deputy, I could not amend an amendment being framed at the time I was considering the wording of my amendment. I found that an impossible task. I ask that the Minister listen to what people on this side of the House are saying, namely, that we need time to consider his latest amendments. If he allows us that time, such consideration would only improve the Bill. I do not believe this is a particularly contentious Bill. What is at issue is a matter of getting it right but if the Minister proceeds the way he is going, he will not get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with colleagues that this is an important and substantive Bill. I have made great efforts to have it brought before the House. The book of 159 amendments to this Bill, which are the substantive ones, was published 12 months ago. The only changes I have made are technical amendments concerning dates and timeframes but there is nothing substantive in any of the recent amendments.</P>

	<P>The amendments published last night comprise 13 amendments to amendments, with which I have no issue, tabled by the Deputy yesterday. When Opposition members table amendments to amendments, the procedure is that the Bills Office reproduces the full text of the amendments.

	<P>The list from which I am working contains 37 groupings. I understand there are only one or two changes to accommodate some of the technical amendments. I would not come before the House and propose that we proceed if I had published substantive amendments to the Bill yesterday. The amendments were published 12 months ago and the Deputies have had those 159 amendments for that period. Those amendments cover all the substantive issues. Due to the delay in taking the Bill, many technical amendments have been required in regard to dates and times. Given that we knew the Bill was coming before the House today, one or two additional amendments were required but they merely concern dates and times. Nothing substantive has been included in them to throw the Deputies off, so to speak.</P>

	<P>An 11-page amendment that was published last night. It states this amendment is in substitution for amendment No. 153 on the principal list dated 30 September 2005. Six of the amendments published are substitute amendments.</P>

That is the procedure followed by the Bills Office. My understanding is that I have not produced anything new of a substantive nature in the past 24 hours. However, the Bills Office follows the procedure whereby it reproduces the entire amendments on the basis of the amendments the Deputy pro<Col N="1707"/>duced last night. That is fine and I will deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

	<P>I have answered, in large measure, the Deputies&rsquo; views on this matter. All of us accept that we would like to deal with the Bill since it has come before the House. What I have tried to do is add substantially to key safety provisions in it. We have engaged in considerable negotiation with the various bodies involved and they are correct in what they put forward in terms of safety issues. We need to pass this Bill within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to put a restrictive timeframe on dealing with this issue. It is an important matter with which we must deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>All we have is the printed material before us. The 17-page document we received last night contains six amendments in the Minister&rsquo;s name, all of which state they are substitute amendments to the Minister&rsquo;s amendments tabled last week. What are we to make of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, both the green list of Report Stage amendments and the book of amendments published today refer to Report Stage. We are now back on Committee Stage. Is it technically correct to have these amendments headed &ldquo;Report Stage&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I have moved to recommit the Bill to give all of us time to deal with the issues before us. I accept that they are substantive in nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of facilitating the House in any way. The Minister is legally obliged to recommit because the amendments were not discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, to delete line 3 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) to enforce this Act and any other legislation relating to railway safety, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">While 43 amendments may appear to be a large number to take together, I am satisfied that they are largely technical and interrelated and should logically be grouped together. First, I will explain the origin of these amendments. The Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, lays a number of functions on the commission. These include the enforcement of railway safety, prosecution of offences and the investigation of accidents in certain cases. Accidents are to be investigated using a no-blame approach. The Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, requires that certain classes of railway accidents are to be investigated by the railway incident investigation unit, while remaining classes of accidents may be investigated by the commission itself.</P>
      <P>Upon reflection, I have come to the view that the commission should have no role as regards the investigation of accidents. It is necessary to ensure that the investigation of accidents and the prosecution of possible offences arising from such occurrences are not undertaken by the same entity, namely, the commission. We must ensure that witnesses to a railway accident and railway workers who are somehow relevant to an investi<Col N="1710"/>gation have full trust in the accident investigators and feel free to speak without fear of prosecution. At the same time, those who have committed an offence which contributed to or caused an accident must be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>The amendments I am proposing will, therefore, clarify the role of the commission, transfer all accident investigation functions from the commission to the railway incident investigation unit and leave the investigation and prosecution of offences and other enforcement action to the commission. This strict separation of roles in respect of accident investigation and prosecution of offences will more clearly define the roles of the commission and the investigation unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 10, as amended, agreed to.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 12 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <P LI="1">In page 13, lines 18 and 19, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;any&rdquo; in line 18 down to and including &ldquo;Act)&rdquo; in line 19 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;its functions as he or she considers appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment. Its purpose is to simply align the wording of section 13(5) with that in section 13(1). The latter provides that I may give general policy directions to the commission in respect of its functions, whereas section 13(5) provides that I may give policy guidelines to the commission as regards the functions assigned to it by law. The difference in language used in the two subsections when referring to the functions of the commission suggests a different interpretation was intended. That is not the case. The textual change proposed in amendment No. 6 makes the wording of section 13(5) similar to section 13(1).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, to delete lines 23 to 34 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;14.&mdash;(1) The Commission shall consist of at least one but not more than 3 members.</P><Col N="1711"/>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(2) Each member of the Commission shall be known as a Commissioner for Railway Safety and is in this Act referred to as a &lsquo;commissioner&rsquo;.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(3) The person who holds, immediately before the establishment day, the position of Chief Railway Inspecting Officer of the Minister, shall, subject to his accepting such period for his holding office on such terms and conditions as fixed under <i>subsection (5)</i>, on the establishment day, become and be a commissioner and is deemed appointed under this subsection.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(4) A commissioner (other than the person referred to in <i>subsection (3)</i>) shall be appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(5) A commissioner shall be appointed to hold office in a full-time capacity for a period of not less than 3 years and not more than 7 years on such terms and conditions, including remuneration, as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may fix.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These amendments relate to the appointment of commissioners and staff of the commission and their purpose is to clarify and improve the text. The Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, provides that the person who currently holds the position of chief railway inspecting officer in my Department will become the first commissioner. With regard to the chief inspector&rsquo;s term of office as commissioner and any other terms and conditions of his appointment, it was intended that his appointment would be subject to the standard terms and conditions for such appointments as set by the Minister under section 14(1). Amendment No. 7 makes this clear.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 relates to other railway inspecting officers and any persons recruited specifically for a job with the commission. The latter group will transfer to the commission on its establishment. Other railway inspecting officers may be transferred to the commission if they are willing to opt for transfer or may be retained in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Although this issue did not arise on Committee Stage, it is an important point. What grade is the position of commissioner? Why will no open competition be held for the post? Has the Minister sought legal advice on this arrangement? It is peculiar, to say the least, that the Minister will appoint someone to a position as important as this. Surely the appointment should be handled by the Local Appointments Commission. In the light of these concerns, I am unable to support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the holder of the office in the interim arrangement will be appointed by the Minister to the commissioner <Col N="1712"/>function in the new arrangement. At the end of his term of office, will the post of commissioner be publicly advertised or will the appointee be recruited from within the Civil Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies have made an important point. The chief railway inspecting office has been earmarked for automatic appointment as commissioner on establishment day. This would involve promotion from principal officer equivalent to assistant secretary equivalent without competition. The chief inspector is eminently qualified for the commissioner post. With regard to the chief inspector&rsquo;s term of office as commissioner and any other terms and conditions of his employment, it was intended that section 14 would apply. As drafted, however, this intention may not be clear and hence the need for a redraft in the amendment. I understand the position will be open to public competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>At what point will a public competition be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be held at the end of the commissioner&rsquo;s term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>How long is the term of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is between three and seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister be precise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision rests with the Minister and will depend on how the appointee performs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept it is bad practice for him to hold the power to appoint someone to a senior Civil Service position such as assistant secretary and to make such appointments behind closed doors without holding an open competition? What is the view of the trade unions representing senior management in the public service on this approach to doing business? While I accept one could argue that continuity is required during the early years of the new body&rsquo;s operations, will the Minister give a commitment to open up the position to competition following the shortest possible period, perhaps three years? Without such a commitment, the Minister will find himself in serious trouble for retaining control of a position of this nature and refusing to allow it to go to a public competition. Does he accept that, in principle, it is bad practice to do as he proposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not necessarily accept the latter point, I agree with some of the Deputy&rsquo;s other points. She is correct that the appointment raises an important issue. Two other commissioners will be appointed and both positions will be immediately open to public competition. I <Col N="1713"/>have no desire to be involved directly or indirectly in these kinds of appointments, nor am I involved in them in any other area. It was decided in discussions that the approach I have outlined was the best option in this case, that is, the person currently acting in the capacity of commissioner should be appointed and two other commissioner positions would be open to public competition. The purpose of the amendment is to implement that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the appropriate term of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed that the person to be appointed is eminently competent and qualified to hold the position of commissioner. I agree that the shortest possible period should elapse before the position is the subject of open competition. As the Deputy will be aware, it will take considerable time to bed in many of the provisions of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is three years a sufficient transition period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope it will be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to hold a public competition after three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to pre-empt what may happen in three years&rsquo; time. Who knows who will be Minister for Transport at that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Surely the Minister does not want positions to be filled by appointees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position will be open to public competition following the initial appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that occur after three or seven years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will happen within that timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be after three or seven years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a reasonable timeframe. I have given the reasons for the decision taken regarding the appointment and the Deputy has backed them up. My preferred option is to have a public competition after the shortest possible period. If, after three years, there was widespread agreement among independent observers that the commissioner was doing an excellent job, I would leave him in the position to allow him to bed in the new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>One way around this problem would be to offer the appointee a three year con<Col N="1714"/>tract which the Minister could extend at his discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision gives effect to the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>What agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was agreed that this was the best way to deal with the position of commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreements on senior posts in the public service, particularly the position of assistant secretary, should not be made behind closed doors. The length of the term of office and the point at which others can expect to have an opportunity to compete for the office should be made clear. The three to seven year period is too long. The Minister should indicate when he intends to open up the position to competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal reason for taking this approach is to ensure continuity. One must also consider the knowledge the appointee possesses. It is not easy, and may not be easy in future, to recruit someone to a short-term contract. We may have to offer a substantive contract to attract the necessary person with the requisite qualifications and standing to do the job. We have opted for an interim position, which is a reasonable and balanced decision. Of the three commissioners to be appointed, the current chief railway inspecting officer will assume one position and the two other posts will be filled through a fully open competition. The third position will be the subject of open competition at a later date.

      <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage Deputy Naughten, in his amendments Nos. 14 and 17, made some suggestions on the annual report of the commission. I thank him for those useful suggestions. I am proposing amendments Nos. 12 to 14, inclusive, in response to the issues raised.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 provides that the annual report of the commission must be published within three months of its receipt in my Department, while amendment No. 13 allows the Minister to give directions to the commission on the format and content of the annual report but will safeguard confidential, sensitive or delicate information. Amendment No. 14 addresses the issue of the provision of information by the commission for the Minister on the performance of its functions. Section 28(4) already requires the commission to supply such information to the Minister. This amendment adds the protection suggested by Deputy Naughten on Committee Stage.</P>

Am I correct in stating the Minister is not accepting it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Deputy is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>Will he state why, bearing in mind that he will be on this side of the House some day?</P>

	<P>I was over there for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>And will be again. I need hardly say to the Minister that it seems every other day we pass legislation which makes us less relevant as a body. More parliamentary questions are being disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle because the Minister is not responsible for this, that or the other. We have seen this occur with the National Roads Authority and a myriad other bodies and, most recently, with the Health Service Executive, in respect of which we cannot find out what is going on in the health service. This is yet another body where it will be impossible for elected Members of this House to get information. Perhaps a caveat similar to that in amendment No. 14 needs to be included in amendment No. 17. I certainly would be happy to insert it on Report Stage. It would be similar to the wording used in amendment No. 14, stating &ldquo;provided that such information would not, in the opinion of the Commission, be prejudicial to the performance of its functions&rdquo;. I can understand some information could be sensitive but the vast percentage of the information sought by Members is not sensitive in the sense that it would not impinge on anybody&rsquo;s privacy. That caveat might be included. It makes no sense to keep legislating to make ourselves irrelevant. I ask the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate and understand the sentiments expressed by the Deputy but it is clearly established practice that the Minister is responsible and answerable in this House for policy. In terms of the commission and other matters, it is the relevant Oireachtas committee to which the commission is answerable. I have no mandate to change this procedure in terms of the way in which the Houses operate and the strengthened committee system in place. I do not have any proposals to unilaterally change it on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not accepted that the Minister is accountable to the House. He clearly will not be accountable to the House under this legislation.</P>

	<P>I am fully accountable to the House for policy in respect of this body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the same way that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children is accountable for the health service, yet we wait six or nine months for an answer. It is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1718"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Mitchell on amendment No. 17. The Minister knows that the system does not work that way. Rail safety is a valid public interest issue. As public representatives, we should have the right to raise such issues in the D&aacute;il and the Minister should be accountable to it for performance on rail safety.</P>
      <P>This is part of a general development that has taken place under the Government and its predecessor, where ever increasing numbers of outside agencies are being set up at arm&rsquo;s length from the Minister with no accountability to the D&aacute;il. It is bad practice which, as Deputy Mitchell stated, makes this House more irrelevant. It also lets the Minister &mdash; Deputy Cullen must bear in mind that he will not always be the Minister &mdash; off the hook entirely. It is all very well to say the commission can be invited to appear before the Joint Committee on Transport. As the Minister will be aware, that may happen once a year or less frequently. There is a need to put a mechanism in place whereby there can be accountability on an ongoing basis to those of us who represent the public. I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider his position on this amendment in the interests of democracy and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have taken on board many of the proposals made by Deputies Naughten and Shortall previously but I am not in a position to change procedures unilaterally. I am fully answerable for anything I have ever done in the House and this has always been my experience. I know there are issues that lead to frustration for Deputies. I have also been frustrated when trying to deal with day-to-day issues. I am fully responsible for all of the agencies and answer questions here regularly by way of parliamentary questions and Adjournment debates. This area is my responsibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Houses of the Oireachtas, for which I have the greatest respect, has a role also. We do not want the same role to be performed here and at an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister may accept amendment No. 15 which would require the commission to furnish the Minister with information. However, the same courtesy is not being provided for Members and the Minister will not convey the information to them. All we require through this amendment is that the Minister should answer parliamentary questions and give to the House information he has been given by the commission. I cannot understand his problem that he cannot change procedures. The procedure has always been that the Minister is responsible to the House and provides information for it. It is farcical for him to tell us that we can receive information at an Oireachtas committee. As Deputy Shortall said, that might happen once or twice a year. A myriad of issues must be discussed at committees. By the time a particular matter might be discussed, it would probably be irrelevant. It is when an issue is live that we need the Minister or the commission to be accountable. This is where it is supposed to happen, but the Minister is deliberately thwarting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that any of my colleagues or I are not held to account for anything for which we have responsibility. We are sometimes held to account for matters for which we do not have responsibility, but that is another argument. The Railway Safety Commission is being set up on the same basis as all other agencies under my aegis, for which I am fully responsible. I have set out in section 31(3) exactly what those responsibilities are with regard to the policy of this organisation. It is the same with all other agencies under my aegis.</P>

      <P FLI="0" LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;, after consultation with the Council, railway undertakings and such other persons as in the opinion of the Commission may be relevant,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Section 39(4) provides that the Railway Safety Commission may produce guidelines on the appropriate contents of a safety case to be prepared by a railway undertaking, and on appropriate technical principles and specifications. Amendment No. 18 imposes a requirement on the commission to consult railway undertakings and the Railway Safety Advisory council before it publishes such guidelines. The section also states a railway undertaking must have regard to these guidelines in preparing a safety case. However, it is also appropriate that a railway undertaking has regard to such guidelines in its application for new works approval under section 42, new rolling stock approval under section 43 and generally in managing its affairs in order that it complies with its duty of care under section 36. Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 are drafted to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This relates to consultation on the preparation and publication of guidelines and the various interests to be consulted. I suggest worker representatives should be consulted. I do not know why it is necessary to raise this. I would have thought it was standard practice to engage in consultation with the representatives of the organisation&rsquo;s workers. I propose that we amend the Bill accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have provided in amendment No. 18 for consultation with the proposed Railway Safety Advisory Council. As the railway unions will have at least three representatives on the council, they will have opportunities to raise issues. Everybody is satisfied that this is the position. The unions will have at least three positions on the council and it was felt that it was the suitable body. Everybody is party to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not necessarily work like that simply because the unions will have representatives on the council. If guidelines are to be introduced, it would seem to make sense that it should be standard practice to have some kind of consultation with the representatives of the workers involved.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1723"/>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why there will be three of them on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that. However, it does not necessarily mean that the people who are most affected by specific guidelines will be consulted on them. It is a form of arm&rsquo;s length consultation. I wonder why some kind of procedure has not been put in place to ensure that the workers who are most affected by the guidelines will be formally consulted, as is normal in most organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been recognised that I have made provision for consultation with railway unions throughout the Bill, where I have felt it to be relevant and appropriate. However, guideline documents, the contents of a safety case and technical principles and specifications are technical railway safety matters, rather than what might be called &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; safety matters which are of interest to the railway unions. I do not believe that consultation with the unions on this issue would serve any useful purpose. Having said that, I reiterate that I have provided for discussions with the proposed railway safety council. There are at least three representatives of the unions on the council. The unions are satisfied with this. They will be more than <i>au fait</i> with exactly what is going on. The matters I have mentioned can be seen as highly specific technical issues, rather than &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; issues which might necessitate direct consultation with the unions. When such consultation is required in respect of certain issues, I have clearly provided in the Bill that direct consultation should be recommended with the unions. My understanding is that everybody is happy with the approach I have adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not intend to make an issue of this. I do not understand what the Minister means when he says the matters in question relate to &ldquo;technical&rdquo; issues, as opposed to &ldquo;on the ground&rdquo; issues. Technical issues need to be considered by people on the ground who are involved in the technical side of the work. We cannot be sure that the three representatives will have expertise of the technical matters in question. There can be a two-stage process of consultation. Those who think that technical issues are different to the issues with which workers deal on the ground are engaging in a strange form of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not necessarily mean to convey the point I was making in a manner that would cause us to split hairs. As I have considered this matter, I have been open-minded about the sort of issues on which the unions have shown a strong interest in being consulted. I have provided for such consultation throughout the Bill. The Deputy is right to state that some workers will be keen to meet to seek advice on <Col N="1724"/>certain technical issues. It is important, for that reason, that the unions will be represented by the three good people who will be proposed as members of the Railway Safety Advisory Council. This is an example of an instance in which it is better to deal with an issue not by talking to every different grouping, thereby avoiding making the entire system over-cumbersome. In drawing up this legislation, there was a need to avoid making things too complicated. We are happy to consult various groups when it is deemed absolutely necessary and right to do so. The people involved in drawing up the legislation felt that the unions need to be involved in the proposed railway safety council so that they can keep abreast of the various issues. We have facilitated this.</P>

      <P FLI="0">These three amendments seek to address the growing legislative trend to remove the right of appeal to the Supreme Court. The Bill provides that appeals will be allowed on the basis of questions of law but not on the basis of questions of fact. It provides that no appeal will be permissible unless it is sanctioned by the High Court. I do not see the justification for such a provision. If the party concerned wishes to appeal a case to the Supreme Court, I do not see why it should be prevented from doing so. The Minister is providing in this Bill that a case can be taken to the Supreme Court if the High Court gives leave to do so. It is poor practice. I do not understand the rationale behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is established precedent in other legislation for the High Court to be given the discretion to allow, or not to allow, an appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law. That discretion is there to ensure that the limited resources of the Supreme Court are not taken up by groundless appeals. I am reluctant to interfere with or restrict that discretion, particularly in light of the practice that has been established in other legislation, such as section 88(9) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, section 32 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and section 38 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001. For the reasons I have outlined, I invite the Deputy to withdraw her amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has agreed with my point that the introduction of provisions of this nature by the Government and its predecessor has become a trend in recent years. The intention behind such provisions is to limit people&rsquo;s rights under the law, a move for which there is no justification. The Minister has quoted a few examples of this form of provision but that does not provide a justification or a rationale for it. I do not see why a person should have to seek the approval of the High Court to take his or her case to the Supreme Court. It seems that an important principle is at stake. People&rsquo;s rights under the law have been restricted in legislation passed in recent times. I do not think it constitutes good practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear that the Judiciary is totally independent in its functions from the Oireachtas or the Executive. I am not trying to limit people&rsquo;s rights under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is limiting those rights.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="1726"/>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If we declare open season for people to try to appeal High Court decisions to the Supreme Court, it is reasonable that we should ensure there are reasonable grounds for the appeal. We should not have an open season that automatically allows everything decided on in the High Court to be sent to the Supreme Court. Such an approach would cause the entire system to become clogged up and we would never get anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 28, line 1, to delete &ldquo;bring into operation&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;commence construction, installation or assembly of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendments before the House make a number of changes to sections 42 and 43 of the Bill, which relate to the approval of new works and rolling stock by the commission. The purpose of the amendments is to make sections 42 and 43 more effective in terms of public safety and more reasonable for railway undertakings. In amendment No. 23 I propose to amend section 42(1) in order that a new works approval must be sought before construction commences, a change with which I think all Members agree. Amendments No. 24 and 25 are consequential.</P>
      <P>Existing 19th century legislation and the present text of section 42(1) of the Bill, which mirrors it, require approval before works are brought into operation. Experience has shown that the majority of risks arise during construc<Col N="1727"/>tion. However, I am also providing that approval to bring the works into operation must still be sought. This phased approval process is in line with best practice.</P>
      <P>Section 42(5) of the Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, allows a railway undertaking seven days to amend its safety case where new works are approved by the commission. On reflection, 21 days is a more reasonable time period to allow for this task and I am providing for this in amendment No. 26.</P>
      <P>Sections 42(10) and 43(10) of the Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, allow the commission three months to make a decision on an application for new works or new rolling stock approval. Railway undertakings have complained that a three month timeframe for approvals will delay projects, which is a fair point. The informal practice of the interim commission in recent times has been to make a decision within 28 days. The interim commission believes such a turnaround time is achievable in most cases. I am, therefore, agreeable to changing the three month statutory deadline to a statutory objective of 28 days. I am providing for this in amendments Nos. 27 and 30.</P>
      <P>Section 42(13) of the Bill, as passed on Committee Stage, specifies the type of works on a railway which will require new works approval from the commission. The commission is given power to make regulations adding other works to those listed in section 42(13). On reflection, the power to make regulations specifying other works which would require approval is a policy matter and is more appropriately reserved to the Minister of the day. It is also appropriate that the Minister be required to consult the commission and railway undertakings before making such regulations. I am providing for these matters in amendment No. 28.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>

      <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(14) Where a railway undertaking proposes to replace the gates at a specific level crossing with barriers, lights or other automatic devices or appliances, and</P>
      <P LI="3" el="5">(<i>a</i>) it has submitted a new works assessment in respect of those works which has been accepted by the Commission under <i>subsection (4)</i>, or</P>

      <P LI="2" el="5">(15) Subject to <i>subsection (16)</i>, section 23 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1971 applies to works under <i>subsection (14)</i> as if those works had been required by an order under section 22 of that Act.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(16) <i>Subsection (15)</i> does not apply to a level crossing to which section 47 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 or section 6 of the Railway Clauses Act 1863 applies.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Under existing legislation dating from 1958 and 1971 &mdash; section 9 of the Transport Act 1958 and section 22 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1971 &mdash; which I propose to repeal, a statutory instrument is required each time Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann wishes to upgrade a level crossing to an unmanned automatic signalled crossing. Under this Bill, all other significant works on the railway simply require new works approval from the commission. Automation of level crossings should not be treated differently &mdash; a point with which the House would agree. The new section 42(14) in amendment No. 29 will remove an unnecessary administrative burden.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 also proposes two saver provisions. Under section 23 of the 1971 Act, a <Col N="1730"/>road authority is required to fund 50% of the cost of level crossing works authorised by an order under section 22 of that Act. This applies to the upgrade of unmanned crossings only. These technical amendments provide that such cost sharing arrangements will continue to apply.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 156 repeals the existing provisions in the 1958 and 1971 Acts which provide for the making of orders for upgrade of level crossings. I had originally intended transferring functions in regard to these provisions to the Railway Safety Commission via Schedule 2 to the Bill but now propose instead to repeal them. Amendment No. 159 is a technical amendment to delete them from Schedule 2 to the Bill. Amendment No. 156 also repeals section 29 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1971. This section relates to regulations to be made in regard to medical assessment of locomotive drivers. I propose to delete this section as no such regulations have been made since enactment in 1971 and I propose alternative more detailed medical assessment provisions in regard to all safety critical railway workers in amendment No. 144 which we will debate shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s explanation of amendment No. 29. However, on a reading of the amendment, it does not seem to mean what he says it means. It states: &ldquo;Where a railway undertaking proposes to replace the gates . . . any obligations to make or maintain gates at that crossing do not apply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to cover a continuation of upgrading of gates. Many unsafe manually operated gates have been removed. The measure is to allow for this. Administratively, it is cumbersome when dealing with such gates to seek all the necessary approvals. This should be dealt with as satisfactorily as other issues have been dealt with.</P>

Amendment No. 34 provides that the Minister, as well as the commission, may also make the regulations mentioned in section 51(<i>d</i>). Amendment No. 35 addresses the issue of a timescale for notification of accidents to the investigation unit.

      <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage, my predecessor agreed with Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s suggestion in her amendment No. 31 that a worker should be allowed trade union representation when being interviewed by a railway undertaking or by the commission in connection with the investigation by either party of a railway accident. Amendments Nos. 36 and 103 are intended to address this issue. These amendments provide that a person may at his or her request be accompanied by a colleague or trade union official when being interviewed by a railway undertaking or by the commission&rsquo;s investigation unit in respect of a railway accident. A person may also be accompanied when being interviewed by the commission in respect of any other matter.

      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I believe the Minister&rsquo;s amendment No. 39 takes on board the spirit of amendment No. 37 which I very much welcome. Perhaps &ldquo;whistleblower&rdquo; is not the right word to use but I believe workers who are at the coalface must be in a position to point out any deficiencies in the workings of any aspect of rail safety procedures. Safety must be a joint venture between management, staff and the commission. Complete transparency and freedom to speak is important as is protection for those who speak out.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 55:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 45, to delete lines 16 to 20 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(13) Where, during the course of its investigation, the Investigation Unit becomes aware of any implications for railway safety which, in its opinion, warrant consideration by a railway undertaking or other person, in advance of the publication of the report of its investigation, the Investigation Unit may make such interim recommendation as it considers to be warranted and feasible for the avoidance of railway incidents or otherwise for the improvement of railway safety. In <i>section 62</i> a reference to a recommendation includes a reference to an interim recommendation under this subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage my predecessor accepted the merit of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s amendment No. 36 which proposes that a railway undertaking should be required to carry out works as soon as practicable when notified by the commission of any implications for railway safety which come to the attention of the commission during the course of its investigation of an incident. This amendment provides that the investigation unit may make an interim recommendation in advance of publication of its investigation report. Under section 62, a person, to whom a recommendation or interim recommendation is addressed, must, as soon as is practical after receiving it, notify the commission action has been taken or proposed or explain why no action will be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 57:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 45, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(15) The Investigation Unit may, before commencing an investigation under this section, make enquiries to determine whether an investigation is warranted.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(16) A railway undertaking shall, as soon as practicable following notification under <i>subsection (14)</i>, provide to the Investigation Unit details of all records held by it, and all information known to it, that may be relevant to an investigation under this section and shall immediately thereafter notify the <Col N="1739"/>Investigation Unit of any further relevant records which come into its possession and any further relevant information that becomes known to it.</P>
      <P LI="2" el="5">(17) An answer, statement or declaration given to an inspector as part of an investigation under this section shall not be admissible as evidence in civil or criminal proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The new subsections proposed are a practical measure to avoid the railway incident investigation unit of the commission launching a formal investigation with all the attendant requirements before it is clear that an investigation is warranted. Some simple initial inquiries may save unnecessary work. The new subsections proposed provide that following notification of the commencement of an investigation, a railway undertaking must provide for the investigation unit details of relevant records held by it and information known to it that may not be recorded. Any further records or information that arise must also be notified to the investigation unit.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage my predecessor accepted the merit of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s amendment No. 35 which proposed that a railway undertaking be obliged to furnish all relevant documentation following the commencement of an investigation. However, I was concerned that the commission could be inundated with unnecessary documentation. Hence the requirement for the notification of the records rather than provision for them.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the preparation of draft reports on an incident. There is a tight confidentiality provision in the section. Technically, it is so tight I believe it would prevent a person affected from seeking technical or legal advice. That is a nonsense which is not the Bill&rsquo;s intention. However, that is how it can interpreted, as drafted. The question of strict confidentiality should not apply to a person&rsquo;s legal or technical advisers subject to an enforceable condition of confidentiality to protect the information. Obviously, the person concerned needs to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 61 requires the commission to allow affected parties to see a draft of a commission investigation report before publication. Section 61(7) prohibits such a person disclosing the draft to any other person. This provision is designed to prevent a report from being leaked to the media. Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s amendment proposes that such a prohibition on disclosure would not apply to a person&rsquo;s professional adviser. While this is probably implied in any case, I am happy that the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is a good one and I will accept it.</P>

He or she may be the best qualified person for such a function. On Committee Stage Deputy Naughten proposed some restrictions on who would be eligible to chair a tribunal of inquiry into a railway accident.

	<P>It is fair to say that financial expenditure and value for money issues have dogged the health system for many years. I wish to discuss another issue which is not directly relevant to the motion but which is topical and deals with value for money issues, namely, the PPARS system. This is the latest saga in respect of value for money in the health services.</P>
      <P>This summer, I became aware there were growing concerns in respect of the PPARS system. I discussed the matter with the Secretary General of my Department who shared my concerns and I asked him to investigate the issue. He convened a meeting between himself and the acting director for ICT and human resources of the Health Service Executive on 16 July. At that time, it was apparent that costs were escalating and that staffing and consultancy accounted for the bulk of the costs incurred. The Secretary General asked the Health Service Executive to review the project and to report back after the summer. He made it clear that no extra staff should be assigned to the project in the meantime. At that meeting, it was agreed the Health Service Executive would examine ways of minimising immediately the consultancy-related costs. A small management group was appointed to consider the issues and the outcome of its deliberations will be considered by the full board of the Health Service Executive tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact the Health Service Executive will address this issue. It is entirely proper that it should decide what is appropriate for a single organisation. No large modern organisation employing 140,000 people can operate without a sophisticated information, pay and personnel system. However, for many years, the biggest problem in the health service was the continuation of the old health boards. Effectively with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, there were 11 different organisations with incoherent policy, inconsistent services, overspending, hidden spending and unsanctioned spending. The Brennan report, published in 2003, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">the Commission found problems in the existing systems, including the absence of any organisational responsibility for managing the health service as a unified national system. Systems are not designed to develop cost consciousness among those who make decisions to commit resources and provide no incentives to manage costs effectively. Insufficient evaluation and analysis of existing programmes and related expenditure [is widespread].</P><Col N="1746"/>
      <P FLI="0">The commission went on to state that no single institution or person was responsible for the day to day management of the service as an integrated national entity and that management and control was far too fragmented.</P>
      <P>The Government took that analysis on board and shortly afterwards it decided to abolish the health boards and establish a single entity to manage and control the health services for 4.1 million people. That was the correct decision and is the only decision that can lead to appropriate control in health spending. Eighteen months later, I steered comprehensive legislation through the Oireachtas in the most fundamental overhaul of the health system in a generation. Notwithstanding that we were creating a single entity, Opposition Deputies opposed our abolition of 53 agencies and 11 boards with 253 members. That jumble of waste and incoherence caused many of the problems. The Brennan commission also noted there was inadequate investment in information and management systems in the health system and that they required significant development.</P>
      <P>Everyone was aware that investment was needed. The problem was, when five chief executive officers of health boards and one hospital decided to introduce new technology to replace their outdated systems in the late 1990s, it was very difficult to anticipate what was appropriate to a fragmented health system with incredible variations, work practices, terms and conditions. In conjunction with the Department, they made an honest attempt to do so. However, it became clear that because of the complexities on the ground, the system they had initially envisaged would not meet the requirements of the technology being devised. Thereafter, a decision was made to move to the PPARS system, which was not what was originally anticipated in the late 1990s. Subsequently, Hay Consultants were appointed and it identified the technology that was necessary because of the complexity of the system requirements. At the time, Hay Consultants estimated the cost to be &euro;100 million.</P>
      <P>I want to give Members an idea of what the system was trying to deal with. Currently, only 40,000 staff are on the system. It has been discovered that there are 29,972 work schedules and rosters, 1,163 local variances from core Health Service Executive practices and 979 different wage types including rules and conditions. In some places, a holy day of obligation is regarded as a bank holiday and staff are remunerated appropriately. No computer system could possibly deal with the complexities and irrationality of what was happening on the ground. Had we maintained the 11 health boards, we would never be able to bring financial coherence to the day to day spending pertaining to health.</P>
      <P>However, the real difficulty remains as to whether we should have attempted a significant <Col N="1747"/>rationalisation in advance of attempting to build a computer system. How long would that have taken? How could it be done? In the meantime, what would one do with the creaking IT system? We must have an appropriate technology system in place, not just as far as payroll, personnel and roster issues are concerned, but also in respect of financial management and the two functions must be compatible. There are thousands of variations and many different methods for remunerating staff. People doing the same job are remunerated in different ways. Indeed, the hours of work appear to differ, with individual arrangements being made in many cases.</P>
      <P>Ideally, one would have a computer system that never made an error. However, the Inland Revenue service in the United Kingdom deleted 1 million taxpayers over a three year period without anyone noticing. Similarly, the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Child Support Agency, which spent £670 million on its computer system, was obliged to postpone the transfer of client files to its new computer system because problems were identified. A total of 400,000 payments have been made in the first half of this year. A small number of errors occurred. The largest error affected 2,000 people, whereby a small sum of additional tax was deducted. This was rectified in their next pay packet. Otherwise, the problems have concerned individual cases. However, it has recently been brought to my attention that elsewhere, a manual system has also made a rather large error in respect of an individual pay cheque. Hence, both manual and human errors occur. A system without errors is an ideal.</P>
      <P>The real issue for the House and the health service is how to ensure we have appropriate responsibility and accountability in the future. When establishing the Health Service Executive, I was determined to ensure its chief executive officer would be responsible for both the day to day running of the organisation and would be financially accountable. He is the Accounting Officer and is accountable to the Oireachtas. This was a fundamental departure from the norm, in which the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children would remain as the Accounting Officer. One cannot have responsibility if one does not have financial control. That decision was opposed by the Opposition Deputies. Deputy Twomey stated that we should have dual responsibility in respect of the Accounting Officer. In other words, two people would be financially responsible. That system would not work and is the kind of system that leads to errors.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Health Service Executive is examining this matter tomorrow. I want to express a number of concerns. The first is in respect of the very large bill paid to consultants. It seems to me that it was extraordinary and <Col N="1748"/>excessive. Now that a single organisation is in place, consultants should only be engaged where there is no in-house expertise. An organisation as large as the Health Service Executive, with 100,000 employees, must have its own in-house expertise in information technology and many other areas. The hiring of consultants should be the last resort. The norm should be to operate without them and to do so should be exceptional. Unfortunately, in recent years the hiring of consultants has become the norm. In a sense, it often gives the illusion that one has a golden cover if one has consultants to say what is appropriate. Frequently, public servants are not respected or trusted in this regard. We have outstanding expertise and we need to use it more.</P>
      <P>In this House and in the media, people have referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General drawing attention to this matter in a report two years ago. That is not true. The only reference to PPARs in his report was an account given by the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children to the Comptroller and Auditor General, explaining the new costs for the IT system. The Comptroller and Auditor General is currently examining this issue. He will have to decide whether the system was appropriate and whether we got value for money. He is the officer charged under the Constitution with carrying out value for money audits on these matters. I look forward to hearing the deliberations of the Comptroller and Auditor General. I am sure Members will be more than prepared for the outcome of those deliberations. Any spending on technology systems should be put on hold and reviewed, so that we can make sure that we are putting the appropriate system in place and that we are getting value for money. Trying to marry a system that might have been appropriate for a small health board into a big national organisation may not satisfy the needs of that organisation. It is appropriate that all of these matters will be thoroughly examined and I have every confidence in the management team, in the director of ICT, Mr. Se&aacute;n Hurley, in Professor Brendan Drumm and in the board of the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>If this system is not appropriate, we must be honest enough to stop throwing good money after bad and to put in place whatever is appropriate. I know that some staff at ground level were annoyed with PPARs because it showed up extraordinary practices. I was not aware that in some places in Ireland, a holy day of obligation was regarded as a bank holiday. I was not aware that some people had to work for 35 hours a week, while others doing the same job only had to work for 32 hours a week on the same pay. I was not aware that people doing very similar things got very different rates of pay and in some cases individual arrangements were made. That was the hangover from the existence of 11 health boards <Col N="1749"/>that so many Members wanted to retain. They still shout at me and claim, as Deputy Twomey did, that I am a control freak. We want to get rid of all of that incoherence and that waste of money.</P>
      <P>We wish these matters did not arise in this way. However, this matter had been under investigation over the summer, as soon as the Secretary General of my Department, of the Department of Finance and I became aware that there were real concerns emerging. We wish to see a system in place where all of the rosters and all of the staff are recorded on a single system. We would then know who is employed by the health service, what he or she is supposed to do, what is his or her pay and remuneration and so on. Absenteeism in the HSE is estimated to cost about &euro;350 million per annum, representing 5% of the pay cost of &euro;7 billion. We need a system in place that can identify work practices, that can ensure that we create rationalisation, that we pay for what we are getting and that we have greater accountability. In particular, we need a system to ensure that patients get a better deal than that which they got for years under the incoherent health board system. That is the system that led to the chaos that may well be the story of PPARs. I welcome the fact that it will be evaluated and I understand the board will recommend to suspend it tomorrow until we have a thorough evaluation. It is correct to pause and reflect. If the system is wrong, we can move on to something else and if it is right, we can continue with it.</P>
      <P>The jury is out on whether the system is flawed. I am not an IT expert and I have had hundreds of such experts call me over the past two days with all kinds of extraordinary stories. I am as confused as anyone else. From the analysis done on our health system, ordinary common sense would dictate that unless we have sophisticated personnel and human resource systems in place, we will not get the kind of value for money and the delivery of health services that are appropriate for 2005 and beyond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report drew particular attention to 46,000 overpayments amounting in value to &euro;56 million. While taking on board the lessons to be learned from the report, it is also important as it shows the extent to which a minority of people often set out deliberately to mislead the Department. For instance, one third of the overpayments were traced to cases of fraud that mainly involved people working and at the same time claiming benefits to which they were not entitled. More than half of the overpayments were described in the report as a customer error. That means that when the cases of more than 20,000 welfare customers&rsquo; means were reviewed, <Col N="1750"/>they were found to have means greater than had been disclosed to Department officials. Examples include almost 1,400 one parent family cases, accounting for more than &euro;l7 million, and more than &euro;7 million in overpayments in 409 estate cases where the full extent of the customer&rsquo;s means only came to light after his or her death.</P>
      <P>When all this is distilled, the actual level of overpayment directly attributed to departmental error was &euro;1.6 million or 3%. This amount is still too much and serves as a timely reminder of the need for constant vigilance and even tighter monitoring of expenditure management systems.</P>
      <P>The overpayments figure for my Department, while substantial, also needs to be viewed in context as the Department of Social and Family Affairs is this year spending more than &euro;12.2 billion on welfare benefits, entitlements and supports. That represents &euro;1 in every &euro;3 spent by the State in 2005. Every week, &euro;250 million in benefits and entitlements reach more than 970,000 welfare customers and directly benefit almost 1.5 million men, women and children. The vast majority of these are genuine customers for whom the weekly payments are often a welfare lifeline and the main contribution to household income. It is also worth noting that each year my Department makes almost 60 million payments to customers. It is clear the Department is involved in assessing, administering and delivering payments on a major scale every day of the year. The Department is working constantly to update the monitoring and inspection systems and the strengthening of detection measures so that the maximum amount of overpayments are recouped and fraud is traced and prevented. Overpayments are recovered either by repayments from the customer or else by deductions from a subsequent social welfare payment. The scale of recoveries of overpayments is increasing. Last year, almost &euro;20 million was recovered, compared with &euro;7 million in 2000.</P>
      <P>The Department is also involved in constant and intensive measures to identify and combat welfare fraud. Around 600 staff are engaged in anti-fraud work that has resulted in anti-fraud savings of almost &euro;390 million in 2004. It is encouraging that in the first six months of 2005, savings of more than &euro;200 million have been achieved. An impressive amount has been achieved by my Department in reducing fraud, overpayment and waste. Naturally, there is still much more to be done. Significant progress is being made in modernising and increasing the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s computer system which is central to tracking overpayments and curtailing fraud. The current computer system for recording and reporting overpayments has been in place since 1987. It is a stand alone system which requires a high degree of manual input. As the Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer pointed out in responding to the report of the <Col N="1751"/>Comptroller and Auditor General, the inadequacies of the current system impact on the Department&rsquo;s overall ability to provide timely accurate data on over-payments. A major project is now in place to replace the current computer system. The requirements for the new system have been specified and the first phase is scheduled to go live in early 2006.</P>
      <P>The new overpayments and debt management system will improve the identification of ways to prevent overpayments occurring and of methods to increase the levels of debts recovered. The system will facilitate the recording of overpayments, allow ongoing tracking of repayments, produce regular management reports and deliver a new debt management strategy. Armed with that extra resource the Department will be able to continue to deal with the overpayment and fraud situation I have outlined to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be brief to afford the Minister, Deputy Cullen, the opportunity to speak. I speak primarily as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. I am very disappointed that the motion has been tabled and signed by other members of this committee. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which forms the basis of the motion, is traditionally discussed in detail by the Committee of Public Accounts. Those who signed the motion for tonight&rsquo;s debate have tried to use the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for political purposes and gain rather than to address the issues dealt with therein.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and this side of the House, I make no apology for saying I do not stand over the abuse, waste or squandering of public money. It is appropriate that the issues raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for 2004 would be addressed fully by the Committee of Public Accounts. The motion tries to go a step too far in the judgments it makes before the committee has had an opportunity to address the issues. When Deputy Burton spoke last night on the motion, she mentioned that the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report has been produced year on year, and yet the issues addressed in the report continue to be identified. I am disappointed by the Opposition&rsquo;s attempt to deal with the issues generally and to attribute political responsibility before they have been addressed specifically. That is by no means appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Where should we do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am especially disappointed by those in the Opposition who are members of the Committee of Public Accounts who signed the motion, such as Deputy Boyle, Deputy Rabbitte, who is not here tonight, and Deputy Noonan. <Col N="1752"/>These are members of the Committee of Public Accounts who will address the specific issues in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Not one issue raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for 2004 has yet come before the Committee of Public Accounts. The manner in which the motion has been discussed before the House appears to indicate that these issues are highlighted but nobody does anything about it. That is factually incorrect. The issues raised come up year in, year out and they are addressed by the Committee of Public Accounts. Departments have accordingly made changes to the way in which they operate. The Committee of Public Accounts has acknowledged the changes that have been made.</P>
      <P>I do not stand over squander or waste by any means. The committee will address the first of the issues raised in this report tomorrow. The issue at stake is not which politician decided X, Y or Z, it is to ask the Accounting Officer why the policy that was in place was not adhered to. Bonuses and promotions often come up for discussion. We must address the issue of accountability. Deputy Boyle knows this as well as I do. Many of the issues under discussion are the responsibility of Accounting Officers and they must account for why certain matters have gone astray.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is anxious to make his contribution. I would not like the debate to end with the belief that the issues raised, which the Committee of Public Accounts will address over the next six or nine months, are new. They are not. No matter what Government has been in power, the Comptroller and Auditor General has produced reports, be they related to the introduction of the PULSE system or the collection of taxes back in the mid-1990s when other parties were in Government, and if we look back over recent years the same issues have come forward time and again. It is the responsibility of the Committee of Public Accounts to address these issues to the relevant Accounting Officers. The motion tonight tries to go a step beyond that, to say that the role of the Committee of Public Accounts is not important.</P>
      <P>I did not count the names of all those who signed the motion but I wonder how many of them read the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, which is the basis of tonight&rsquo;s motion. How many of them will ever address a single issue raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General? I cannot understand this attempt to bypass the procedure of the Committee of Public Accounts which addresses these issues. I have served on the Committee of Public Accounts for three years. In that time, many Departments have acknowledged its recommendations and findings and have implemented the relevant changes. I am disappointed that the motion was brought to the <Col N="1753"/>House. I support the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My contribution will focus on the national roads programme and the West Link bridge.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to continuing to invest in our roads infrastructure. With the delivery of each new road, jobs can grow and community life is enhanced. When our programme is completed, Ireland will for the first time have a modern roads infrastructure to support economic and social life.</P>
      <P>The Government has committed record resources of &euro;7.8 billion over the period 1997-2005 for national roads. The return and benefits this investment is bringing in every part of the country are clear, especially for those who have had to put up with poor quality roads for too long. For each new project we are seeing the elimination of major traffic bottlenecks leading to shorter journey times and greater journey time certainty. The removal of key bottlenecks at Monasterevin, Kildare and Cashel, the opening of the Limerick southern ring road, the Sligo inner relief road, the Kinsale road interchange, the Kinnegad-Enfield bypass and the Dundalk Western bypass, and the widening of the Naas dual carriageway are just some of the significant benefits we have, or will see, on our road network.</P>
      <P>The high quality network we are putting in place is contributing significantly to our national competitiveness, job creation and more balanced regional development. With the delivery of each new road we are ultimately improving the quality of life for thousands of people in bypassed towns and villages. We will continue to support this ambitious programme.</P>
      <P>I want to place on record a few facts relating to the cost of the national roads programme. First, the NRA is completing this year&rsquo;s projects with a total outturn cost of &euro;1.17 billion, which compares to a pre-construction budget for these projects of &euro;1.18 billion. Second, of the 21 large scale road projects currently in construction and costing in excess of &euro;15 million, 18 of these are on or under budget and will be delivered on or before time. Of the other three, each will be delivered on time. Any overruns are the result of increased land acquisition costs, planning matters or on-site construction issues.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that on infrastructure costs, for several Governments, involving several political parties, over several years, there have been challenges. The old style of contracts of the 1980s and 1990s, where any additional costs fell to the taxpayer, resulted in increased and inflated outcomes. The Government and its agencies, recognising this, have moved progressively and have changed this outdated structure. Most significantly, since 2002 we have moved to the greater <Col N="1754"/>use of the design and build form of contract which ensures greater certainty of outturn costs. This measure, introduced by the Government, has resulted in greater accuracy than existed ever before.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In addition, since 2000 the NRA has strengthened its cost estimation, control and procurement procedures on the delivery of roads. This is designed to have more accurate cost estimates from the earliest stages of a project and to ensure greater certainty of outturn costs between tender stage and completion date. Improvements include a greater use of the more efficient and cost effective design and build, lump sum fixed price contracts, the appointment of a cost estimation specialist who reviews all cost estimates, benchmarking of tender and scheme outturn costs, design and construction standards established by the publication of the NRA specification for roadworks and a design manual for roads and bridges, the adoption of a 26 m instead of a 36 m carriageway cross section for motorways and high quality dual carriageways, further attention to improving the quality of site investigations and acceptance by contractors as an agreed basis for pricing.</P>
      <P>Each of these measures has led to an improvement in project management and consequential tightening on cost controls. The costs of construction services are determined through an open transparent public tendering process. Let us be honest with the public which we serve, it is the tender price that matters. The cost of the other major element of road projects, namely, land, is determined by negotiation and, if necessary, arbitration within the statutory process for purchasing land compulsorily. Every Member in this House who has worked for improved infrastructure in his or her constituency is very familiar with this process.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that major road improvement projects are subject to robust economic and environmental appraisal. All the projects demonstrate a high rate of return. The Government will continue to work to achieve even greater certainty. We have initiated a process between Government and construction industry interests on fixed price contracts. This process is progressing and will conclude shortly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The West Link bridge was also raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report. A copy of my speech, which sets out the facts of this matter, has been circulated to the House. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General who spotted an underpayment in respect of the bridge. We immediately had the matter resolved. While I am unhappy that such a matter arose, I want to ensure it will not happen again.</P>
      <P>Deputies from Fine Gael and the Labour Party, during their time in Government, aspired to nothing more than mediocrity. Mediocrity in respect of the economy meant we did not gener<Col N="1755"/>ate the resources, mediocrity of vision meant we did not plan for the future, and mediocrity of management led to a growing infrastructural deficit.</P>

	<P>This side of the House will not take any lectures on mediocrity from a mediocre man. We will not have any lessons on the proper use of public money from someone who, in every Department in which he has served, managed to <Col N="1756"/>come up with at least one crisis that kept this House and nation entertained, if not furious.</P>

	<P>The public is being worn down by the same old talk. What is Deputy Boyle going to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of whether we should have a debate of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The first thing that would happen is that there would be a split among the Green Party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party because their policies are so disparate. It would be impossible for them to work together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have moved on to another point, just as the Minister should move to another Department, or preferably the backbenches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is old hat. The Deputy should be a little more original and witty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Curran&rsquo;s point on whether we should have this debate, it is a quite legitimate use of this Chamber&rsquo;s time to discuss, as a matter of right, the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General before referring it to the Committee of Public Accounts, just as every Bill is subject to a Second Stage debate and subsequently referred to committee. I am privileged to serve on the Committee of Public Accounts, which I am pleased to say is quite effective in the limited role it is asked to play on behalf of this Parliament. Just as the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General can only record historically, the Committee of Public Accounts is limited similarly in that it can only say what has happened after it has happened. It lacks the power to intervene and to be proactive rather than reactive.</P>
      <P>In having this debate, which should happen on an annual basis, we should bear in mind the need to reform the Committee of Public Accounts and give additional resources and powers to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The dispiriting aspect to this debate is that, even today during Leaders&rsquo; Questions, the Taoiseach stated by way of defending himself that the issue of the payroll computer system for the Health Service Executive was mentioned in last year&rsquo;s annual report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. That being the case, the Taoiseach has <Col N="1757"/>no defence because, since the issuing of that report, the circumstances in question have deteriorated and have been left unchallenged. No one at administrative level and particularly at political level has been able to take responsibility for the matter.</P>
      <P>The litany of instances of over-expenditure exposed by the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is incorrect. The Taoiseach said action was being taken in the middle of last year. The Deputy is misquoting him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the fact that circumstances have worsened since last year&rsquo;s report. The Government has allowed the problem to deteriorate and has no defence in that regard.</P>
      <P>Consider the transport budget that the Minister for mediocrity and his predecessor in that office have tried to defend. It increased from an original Estimate of &euro;5.8 billion to an eventual cost of &euro;18.2 billion. If one added up all the sums pertaining to excess expenditure by the Government since it came into power in 1997, the total would come close to a whole year&rsquo;s expenditure. One would find that the budget for one year in every eight is wasted through excess expenditure. When the Minister talks about the amount being spent and the amount of tax being collected, I think he should qualify his boasts by stating that quite a large proportion of that money is being flushed down the toilet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is saying &ldquo;I think&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are getting less bang for our buck, fewer public services and less capital infrastructure because of the mediocrity and mismanagement of the Government.</P>

	<P>Thoughts from Dan Boyle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Debates of this nature are very important to ensure the Government is brought to account and that the means exist, within this Parliament through an effective Committee of Public Accounts and through a strengthened Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, to ensure these events do not recur.</P>

	<P>No Government in the history of this State has had the resources available to it that have been enjoyed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition since 1997. Few governments in the world have had the potential to plan and spend over such a protracted period, yet one must ask how many could have made such a hash of their opportunities as this one. Its record stands to prove it.</P>

	<P>Despite the many warnings over the years, the Government has presided over a system in which contracts for massive public infrastructural projects have been exploited shamelessly by developers. The enormous overruns on road projects have drained oceans of public money into the pockets of the big players in the construction industry and to flocks of contractors and consultants.</P>
      <P>The tribunals have cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, is there any chance of putting a bit in the mouth of the Minister of State and exercising a little control over him?</P>
      <P>The tribunals have cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of euro. The Government would not listen to the appeals on this issue in this House, just as the Minister of State and his colleagues would not do so tonight. How many times did Deputies, including myself, point to the astronomical fees being paid to tribunal lawyers and the need to curb their expenses? We now find that, in both the cases I have cited, half-hearted efforts are being made to close the door, long after the horse has left the stable and, in many cases, bolted the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am tempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We are being told moves will be made to establish fixed-price contracts for public infrastructural projects. Will the Minister of State tell the House when this will be done? If ever it comes about, it will be too late because the fortunes have already been made and the hundreds of millions of euro that could have been saved and used for health services, education and child care are now lost and gone. Similarly, the tribunal lawyers have made their money and the new rates of pay are being set as the tribunals themselves are closing down.</P>
      <P>This Government introduced a wide range of property-based tax reliefs and exemptions without any cost benefit analysis.</P>

	<P>The same Government has pushed ahead with its public private partnership strategy despite the findings of a previous Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report that showed schools built under private partnership strategy could have been built in the normal way by the State at a much lower cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Another massive waste of money is on the way, perpetrated by the Minister for Health and Children. She wants to give away sites at public hospitals to the private health sector and subsidise the building of more private hospitals. The same Minister is now faced with the mess that is the PPARS computer system. I have been contacted by workers in the health system who confirmed all that has been said about this in the past few days.</P>
      <P>When the PPARS system was initiated in 1999, workers at the coalface, including those working on health service payrolls, warned that it would not work. They are angry that they were not listened to, just as the Minister of State refuses to listen tonight. That is typical of the arrogance of the Government of which he is a member. The Minister of State and management swallowed the assurances given by highly paid consultants responsible for the system.</P>
      <P>Health service workers speak with frustration about the junketeering of senior management since 1999. When we delve into the full details of this particular disgrace, information will emerge on the weeks and weekends spent in Sligo and elsewhere under the guise of getting the system up and running. However, here we are six years later and nothing is up and running.</P>
      <P>In one HSE location in Dublin, Deloitte and Touche have two employees <i>in situ</i> and the consultancy firm is being paid &euro;15,000 per month. I was contacted by one of my party colleagues, a former member of the North Western Health Board, who queried the amount of money being spent on PPARS by the health board. He was reassured that this was all necessary and above board and would improve efficiency. We now know that those assurances were wrong. With all that has been exposed, rather than heckle Members of the Opposition, this Government would do better to shut up and listen. Maybe it will learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is getting very hot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion. There is widespread public concern at the revelations of the incredible waste of hundreds of millions of euro by this Government. Last year, it was the Punchestown event centre and &euro;60 million for electronic voting. This year, it is the purchase of <Col N="1760"/>agricultural land at exorbitant rates for a prison and &euro;160 million for a botched computer system for the health service, and these are just the more glaring examples of incompetence and mismanagement which have become the trademarks of Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats misgovernance. Meanwhile, the scandal of tax evasion remains widespread and, as always, the overwhelming burden rests upon the pay packets of the PAYE sector. Anger is increasing among PAYE workers and this Government&rsquo;s squandering of resources is fueling that anger.</P>
      <P>People are outraged that incompetence results in the loss of vast amounts of taxpayer&rsquo;s money whereby essential social and educational facilities for communities might have been financed. Schools such as Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra are left in sub-standard prefabs. Accident and emergency wards are in deplorable conditions. An autistic child was refused funds for specialist help. Pre-school and after school projects for the disadvantaged would be non-existent but for the efforts of local people. Organisations such as Women&rsquo;s Aid are unable to cope because of inadequate funding. A whole range of school building projects is put on the long finger, while a vast amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money is literally thrown away. That is the perception and people are asking when they can rid themselves of this Government which has shown itself incapable of proper management of resources to benefit those sections of society in urgent need of a range of facilities and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is little point in the Comptroller and Auditor General issuing a report which the Committee of Public Accounts forensically examines each year if we continue to act the same way. Taxpayers&rsquo; money belongs to taxpayers. In Kildare last March, I met many people who do battle every day with traffic jams to and from work, struggle to find affordable child care places and watch their children being educated in schools with the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the country. They know waste is a cost for them. The people of my area are no different to those of any other constituency. They know that we have a good economy, which they have worked to build. The return they want from that good economy is a good society with solid community support and adequate services.</P>
      <P>When Ministers refer to &ldquo;our&rdquo; economy, I get the impression they mean &ldquo;their&rdquo; economy. There was a lack of outrage with regard to the &euro;52 million hit on e-voting or the 30% increase in West Link tolls. The litany of cost overruns is simply explained &mdash; there is no sense of outrage among Ministers.</P>
      <P>It was a political decision to substitute private beds for public beds. The Comptroller and Auditor General did us a great service when he highlighted the ways in which the treatment purchase <Col N="1761"/>fund can be abused. Are we surprised to learn that substituting privately run facilities for publicly run ones adds to the cost because of profit margins?</P>
      <P>It is a political decision to impose a staff embargo, yet this morning the Taoiseach claimed that good value was achieved in his Department by doing the work directly. He tells us that consultants were overused in the payroll scandal. It is a political culture that allows &euro;50 million to be spent for advice on the purchase of the payroll system without seeking guarantees. I would not purchase an electric toaster without a guarantee. The Government needs to sit up and think because it will be confronted by these matters in the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report comes around with groundhog day inevitability, an annual litany of sheer incompetence and bungling. The theme song for this annual report should be the traditional tune of Quare Bungle Rye. Year after year, we return to the glaring waste and mismanagement of millions of euro in taxpayers&rsquo; money. I have no doubt that similar situations will arise in future years.</P>
      <P>I have yet to learn of any individual being brought to account for the intolerable cost overruns and wanton waste outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report. This contrasts with the State&rsquo;s enthusiasm in pursuing social welfare fraud. Some 46 people went to jail for misappropriating less than &euro;500,000. I do not suggest that fraudsters should go unpunished but what is happening to our public funds is a type of fraud, yet nobody has been held to account.</P>
      <P>An example of shameful mismanagement occurred in my constituency, where &euro;12 million which was handed back by Waterways Ireland could have been spent in the area. A shining example of cross-Border co-operation could have involved improvements in the infrastructure of the Ulster canal. This represents the mismanagement of public money. At this juncture in the peace process, the canal&rsquo;s re-opening would demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s intentions to renew and revitalise all-Ireland infrastructures. The tragedy in this matter is that the money was available but was handed back.</P>
      <P>The Health Service Executive has an end of year budget, from which various sections receive funding to buy, for example, paint or pictures to decorate rooms. However, it is not possible to get the funds to buy a nappy for a patient. These are the type of issues we will have to investigate because funds cannot be transferred from one area to another. It leads to irresponsible spending at the end of the year. If people discover that they have money to spend, they will spend it come hell or high water. This situation also obtains among local authorities, which dig up streets during <Col N="1762"/>Christmas each year because budget money must be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support this motion. Waste has to be confronted, cannot be condoned and must be eliminated. As someone who has worked at the coalface of general hospital services for more than 20 years, I am keenly aware of the absolute need to efficiently use scarce resources. Were waste confronted, the additional monies made available could be used for hospital, educational and housing services.</P>
      <P>For the past ten years, &euro;5 million has been sought by my constituency for South Tipperary General Hospital and to provide proper services in Cashel and Clonmel. The &euro;50 million wasted on e-voting would supply ten times and the &euro;150 million wasted on PPARS 30 times the required funds. I am aware of this situation and would like to see waste confronted and eliminated. I hope that neither the Government nor the Opposition will use this issue as a smokescreen to deflect from the more serious issue of the mismanagement of Government funds whereby the budget surplus, which currently is &euro;34 billion, was used and prioritised in the eight years the two Government parties have been in office to build roads and bridges and roll out broadband instead of being used to provide social services such as health, education and housing. The best infrastructure a country could have is a well educated workforce and a healthy population. That money should be used to fund social services. The Government&rsquo;s failure to do that marks its greatest mismanagement and scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I deplore the Government&rsquo;s incompetence, mismanagement and the failure to ensure that taxpayers get value for money. This issue concerning the lack of accountability and proper respect for the citizens of this State highlights once again the waste of resources in our health service and in other public projects. This is not good enough when people are lying on trolleys and special needs assistants cannot be retained for children with disabilities. Children who need it cannot get speech therapy or occupational therapy services. This is not good enough and it makes my blood boil to listen to this debate.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of the waste of public money, I wish to highlight a number of examples. We learnt a month ago that the Dublin Port tunnel in my area was &euro;200 million over budget and now it is in region of &euro;335 million over budget. The electronic voting system cost taxpayers &euro;52 million. The Government spent &euro;30 million to buy a farm that was valued at &euro;4 million. The Battle of the Boyne site, which could have been bought for &euro;2.7 million, was bought instead by a private business and then sold back to the Office <Col N="1763"/>of Public Works 18 months later for &euro;7.8 million. There was the revamping of the courthouse in Cork estimated to cost &euro;6.5 million but which ended up costing the taxpayer the much larger amount of &euro;26.5 million. Some 30 road projects, which were estimated to cost &euro;932 million, have set us back &euro;2.97 billion. Other road projects were 86% over budget.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I raise these issues along with the Trim Castle issue. They highlight the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money &mdash; the money of the Deputies opposite and of ours. The finance wasted could have ended the scandal of patients being treated on trolleys. It could have been used to build all the new schools required. It could have made a major dent on social housing waiting lists. It could have provided child care services and services to assist our elderly. That deals with a point raised by Deputy Curran.</P>
      <P>This motion is about waste, taxpayers&rsquo; money, accountability and, above all, ensuring that the money of citizens of this State is spent effectively and wisely. I urge all Deputies to support this Opposition motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Broughan and Costello.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I was delighted to be in the House tonight to see the Ministers who were present scratch around for something to say to save their miserable reputations in their Departments. After they uttered their few measly words, they all scurried out of the Chamber rather than stay and listen to what we have to say about them.</P>
      <P>In regard to the health service on which I wish to comment, it is amazing that the T&aacute;naiste, who brought a few of her Progressive Democrats colleagues to support her, can come into the House to talk about the Health Service Executive as if it will dramatically change something. The Health Service Executive and its management is made up of the former health boards and their staff and nothing has really changed in that respect. The idea of a changed management structure means nothing more than the positions such staff held have changed. As the T&aacute;naiste raised this issue, I do not see any problem in commenting on it.</P>
      <P>There was an able administrator in the Southern Health Board who was put in charge of the information and communications technology unit of the Health Service Executive, the same person who oversaw this PPAR system. One of the findings that might emerge from this debate is the level of expertise this gentleman had in running a complex information technology system for the health service. The T&aacute;naiste pointed out the complexity of this system and referred to the 900 forms of payments. This issue is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s <Col N="1764"/>responsibility. That is the reason there is a senior Minister and three Ministers of State in the Department of Health and Children. They are supposed to give direction via the Department of Health and Children to what is happening in the HSE. If there is something seriously wrong with the HSE, it is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responsibility. That is one point I wish to make.</P>
      <P>I also point out to the T&aacute;naiste that in other jurisdictions, such as in America, there are health management agencies which cater for 30 million to 40 million patients rather than numbers such as the 4 million population here. They can use information technology to connect to general practitioners&rsquo; surgeries, hospitals, laboratories and radiology departments, yet we cannot even pay 100,000 people working in our health service. There is serious problem and it starts at the top with the T&aacute;naiste and the Government because they have allowed this mess to develop. They do not have to go far to find solutions. The T&aacute;naiste needs to do the job properly and not treat taxpayers&rsquo; money as if it were the Government&rsquo;s slush fund to look after its cronies and party people. That is part of the problem.</P>
      <P>It will be nice to hear what the HSE has to say tomorrow. It is bringing in a recommendation of the Hanly report, the dealing with which will take up the time of many of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers over the weekend. This issue is probably far more important to them in terms of trying to save their seats because the Government is not doing anything to help them.</P>
      <P>The national treatment purchase fund is the only aspect of the health service that arose in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, which is surprising considering the mess in accident and emergency departments. As we debate this motion, 250 patients are on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country. Some 30,000 people are anxiously waiting for medical cards and 200,000 are waiting for doctor-only medical cards that were promised last January. The MRSA and many other bugs are rampant in our hospitals, yet the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response to this problem is to issue guidelines that were last issued in 1996. The best she can do is re-issue a set of guidelines.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the illegal nursing home charges, we discovered during a debate in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that nobody was responsible for that and that it just happened. Now &euro;150 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has gone down the drain on PPARS. It does not matter what excuses the Taoiseach made in that regard. Perhaps it is difficult for him because he was not quite sure whether it was an information technology project, but he changed his mind, read his brief and realised it was an information technology project. At least there is some hope that matters will move on from there. However, what is happening at Government level has a considerable bearing <Col N="1765"/>on the misery inflicted on many children and vulnerable communities in our country. It is a disgrace.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to deal with the national treatment purchase fund. Of the 23,000 patients who were treated under that fund, and no doubt they were delighted to have been treated, half of them will not have noticed that they were treated under it because they will have been treated in public hospitals while one third will have been treated in the hospital where their names were on the waiting list. It is possible that they will have been treated by the same consultant under whose name they were.</P>
      <P>This report exposes one of the first lies about the national treatment purchase fund. In 2002, medical advice to the fund stated that there can be nothing more frustrating for a group of consultants than to see a contraction in the public hospital service and money being diverted to the private system. In the past three years that has reached a double contradiction because the public health service is still starved of money and other resources, while the same hospitals and, in many cases, the same consultants are doing between one third and half of all procedures under national treatment purchase fund. There is something wrong about that. This report poses two questions which should be answered, namely, how a hospital with a long waiting list for operations can have the spare capacity to do private work and whether these hospitals, if funded properly, could do the same work. Is the national treatment purchase fund nothing more than a photo opportunity for Ministers? This is a serious question.</P>
      <P>I will use general practice as an example to explain what is happening under the national treatment purchase fund because people might understand it better. Imagine if GPs approached the Government and said they were finding it difficult to see their medical card patients and the Government responded by indicating it would set up a medical card treatment purchase fund under which the patients they could not get to see would be seen by a private doctor. Three years later someone suggests that the system be examined. They find a third of those patients are being treated by the doctor being paid for their medical card capitation. Half of all those patients are being treated by doctors who look after the medical card patients. That is an outright scandal and that is how stupid it looks when put in terms that people can understand.</P>
      <P>I also want to know what is going on as regards orthopaedic surgery. Some 83% of the cases for hip replacement under the national treatment purchase fund were carried out in public hospitals. Some 45% of them were carried out in the hospitals where the patients were on waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery. There is something <Col N="1766"/>seriously wrong when my patients are waiting for anywhere between three and five years to get to the outpatient clinic of the same consultant. These are the types of anomalies Deputy Curran was very worried about earlier, concerned as he was that this report was being debated before it goes to the committee. It is far more important that he should investigate why such anomalies exist within the system.</P>
      <P>The national treatment purchase fund is another lie. A lie is a deliberate deception. That is the issue as regards the three months waiting time.</P>

	<P>I will settle for &ldquo;deliberate deception&rdquo;, so, because the public pronouncements on the national treatment purchase fund are peppered with references to three months waiting time for an operation. A patient will not even get to see a consultant within three months from the time the general practitioner writes a letter. For many specialties such as dermatology, ENT, orthopaedics etc. it is between two and seven years. A patient will not even get on the national treatment purchase fund scheme for three months after he or she is put on the waiting list in the hospital. At least the television advertisements say, &ldquo;Terms and conditions apply&rdquo;. Let us stop misleading the general public or I will tell every patient to go and talk to the Minister if they are not seen in three months, since that is what people are promised.</P>

	<P>I have reflected on the nature of Government and Opposition in recent weeks. I recalled in particular the 1994-97 period when the Minister of State and his colleagues were in opposition. It was a very good Opposition in many respects. Each morning, the present Ministers, Deputies O&rsquo;Donoghue and Martin, who were backbenchers would jump up and down and rant and rave, and the present Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, would sit there with a really cranky face. Basically, there was very little policy on offer, just a cranky, obstreperous opposition. They were really good at it. When I read the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report I concluded they were equally bad at Government. One of the problems highlighted in this House in report after report is that based on its past record, the Government should ideally be in opposition and perhaps the people on this side who have some policies and strategies should be in government. I hope tonight&rsquo;s debate and the unbelievable stream of incompetence and waste this report displays confirms that both Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs should head into opposition as soon as possible.</P><Col N="1767"/>
      <P Just="Left">I will deal briefly with chapter 11 of the report on the astonishing saga of Media Lab Europe. It opened in May 2000 and collapsed ignominiously earlier this year. During its lifetime it employed more than 70 workers and just prior to closure there were 45 people. It was part of the regeneration of the digital hub project in the Liberties. It collapsed with ultimate losses in the region of &euro;65 million, and astonishing direct costs to the State of almost &euro;40 million in subsidies and grants to MLE, MIT and property spending of almost &euro;24 million or &euro;25 million. It is clear that the sad and sorry saga of Media Lab Europe&rsquo;s existence has cost the Irish State dearly. However, it appears that once again this Government is prepared to shrug its shoulders and paint the disaster as just one of these things that happen, attributing it to just the normal cost of technological change and risk. It is only &euro;65 million or &euro;40 million, or only &euro;150 million this morning. It does not really matter.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Media Lab Europe, however, was at the very heart of the digital hub strategy for the regeneration of the Liberties. Yet when it was established with a hefty outlay of taxpayers&rsquo; money, the Taoiseach and his <i>aide de camp</i>, Mr. Paddy Teahon, put no structures in place to ensure effective, transparent and fiscally responsible management for the centre. From the outset there was a total lack of strategic vision for the digital hub and MLE, especially up to 2002. When compared to what the Korean government did in Seoul and the Malaysians did in Kuala Lumpur one can see what a pathetically organised plan it was. It lacked dynamic leadership and vision from the very start, although there were four highly rewarded chief executives. The Taoiseach liked to swan around with Professor Nicholas Negroponte of MIT, the MLE chief executive, Dr. Rudy Burger and the others. None of them, including the Taoiseach, gave the slightest thought to what this project was actually for.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The conclusions of the Higgins consultancy report in 2004, from which the Comptroller and Auditor General quotes, are pretty devastating. It stated that the contribution of MLE to its founding objectives appeared to be zero or close to it and that the quantitative indicators pointed to a flawed and largely failed entity. That report went on to identify failure after failure. When negotiations between the Minister then responsible, Deputy Dempsey, MIT and MLE finally collapsed, one of the fundamental conclusions was that there had been almost no link or collaboration with Irish universities such as Trinity College Dublin, DIT and the National College of Art and Design, all located close to the project. The mismanagement of MLE was mirrored at Government level where responsibility for the laboratory was shifted from pillar to post &mdash; from the Department of the Taoiseach to the Depart<Col N="1768"/>ment of Public Enterprise, to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach had two pet projects, both disastrous for the State. He and Mr. Teahon gave their favourite pet project, the Abbotstown campus, at least some attention, and so we have the leaking National Aquatic Centre. However, they totally and disgracefully ignored and neglected Media Lab Europe. It was obvious from an early stage that we would head into serious difficulties. Earlier this year on behalf of the Labour Party I requested that the Comptroller and Auditor General urgently investigate the MLE disaster and how it was being run up to 2005. I know that Deputy Noonan, Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts did so, too. I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s investigation of the disgraceful mismanagement as revealed in his report, which makes such grim reading.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for the hi-tech downturn and the level of risk involved in any technological development, MLE was a unique &euro;60 million disaster, another desperate failure for which the Minister responsible would immediately resign in a normal democratic country. In this case the Minister responsible is the Taoiseach. It is past time for him to resign.</P>

	<P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has found that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was one of the worst offenders in terms of incompetence, mismanagement and failure to ensure that the taxpayer got value for money in 2004. The incompetence did not start in 2004. In 2001 the Department purchased Brock House in Donnybrook for &euro;9.9 million and it still lies idle even though it was intended for asylum seekers. In my constituency the Department purchased Parnell West Hotel in 2001 and after two years it is lying idle and disused on health and safety grounds. It was not properly examined by the OPW in the first place. Only last week we saw how Thornton Hall, a farm in north County Dublin that should only have cost &euro;5 million to &euro;6 million had been purchased by the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for &euro;29.9 million. If we go back earlier than this I am sure we can find similar examples of extravagant wastage in the Department.</P>
      <P>While the Minister presents himself as the terror of &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; asylum seekers the Comptroller and Auditor General found that of the 10,813 failed asylum seekers from 1999 to 2004 on whom deportation orders had been served, only 2,275 were actually deported. He found that it took an average of eight months for the Department to translate asylum seekers&rsquo; applications into English. There was an average gap of one to three years between the final refusal of an asylum application and the issuing of the deportation order. The entire asylum system is a slow, expens<Col N="1769"/>ive, wasteful shambles, which cost the taxpayer a whopping &euro;129 million in 2004. Failed asylum seekers are playing ducks and drakes with the Minister and his Department. Behind the Minister&rsquo;s bluff and bluster on the issue is a track record of gross incompetence and harsh insensitivity. A few vulnerable non-nationals, mainly women and children, are targeted, rounded up and deported in a glare of publicity.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?>
      <P>The position in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is equally ludicrous. A questionable agreement was approved by the Cabinet in 1997 for the use of masts on Garda stations by the Esat mobile telephone company, now known as O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?>. It took the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform five years to finalise the licence fee, by which time Esat owed the Garda &euro;3.6 million in arrears. Although these were belatedly paid, not a cent in lost interest was recouped. Amazingly, the 1,000 mobile telephones provided by Esat as part of the agreement became the only secure communications network the Garda possessed between 1997 and now.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a secure Garda communications network, the GSM network supplied by Esat to less than 10% of garda&iacute; as an incidental part of the telecommunications mast contract remains the only secure Garda communications system. Every criminal in Ireland can listen into the outdated analogue radio system which must be used by 11,000 of the 12,000 members of the Garda force. It is no wonder the robbers are a step ahead of the cops.</P>
      <P>The Minister is guilty of the gravest dereliction of duty by not having the proposed digital Tetra communications network up and running and available to the Garda. In the fight against crime, particularly gangland crime, technology is essential but the Minister makes the Garda look like Keystone Cops by failing to equip them properly. Incidentally, the 1,000 garda&iacute; who have O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> mobile telephones have all premium lines, that is, chat lines, blocked, no doubt to protect their faith and morals. Moreover, the Garda must operate its dubious PULSE computer system which is only available in one quarter of Garda stations. This results in rural-based garda&iacute; having to travel 20 to 30 miles to input material into a system which is incredibly slow and cumbersome.</P>
      <P>The Prison Service has not covered itself in glory either. The attempt by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, beginning in 2002, to introduce a modern information technology-based human resource management system, HRMS, for the Prison Service ended in disaster in December 2004 when it was discontinued and the old system reinstated at a cost of &euro;450,000. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Accounting Officer for the Department assured him that his Department &ldquo;had learned a very considerable lesson from its experiences with HRMS&rdquo;. The Comptroller and Auditor General concluded that &ldquo;any further IT projects on a cross-agency basis, will need to be critically examined &mdash; irrespective of the <Col N="1770"/>demands or where they are coming from &mdash; to ensure that they can meet the requirements of the different entities involved.&rdquo; In other words, the job was botched and while a costly lesson had been learned, nobody was for the high jump.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has informed me that the purchase of Thornton Hall will be the recipient of his attention in next year&rsquo;s annual audit. I have no doubt that his 2005 report will put this year&rsquo;s findings in the shade.</P>

More than previous Governments, we have been particularly active in improving arrangements for the management of public expenditure and seeking to address the issues and concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General and others.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, the Government has presided over a major improvement in public services across the board and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, set out the record in this regard in his cogent address last night. I remind Deputies of the significant measures taken by the Government to improve appraisal and management of public capital programmes and projects and generally secure better value for money from the high levels of public expenditure. They include the introduction in the budget for 2004 of a five-year rolling, multi-annual capital envelope framework incorporating a carry-over facility, new capital appraisal guidelines published in February 2005 and reform of public procurement and public sector contracts. The rolling five-year, multi-annual capital envelopes with their carry-over facility provide medium-term certainty for Departments and their implementing agencies. Together with the revised capital appraisal guidelines, they are delivering better management of public programmes and capital projects and producing a more even flow of projects which is resulting in better project appraisal and projects being completed on time and within budget in many cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Comptroller and Auditor General has done an exemplary job in preparing his most recent report. Among the many areas he identified in the report as being in serious need of overhaul are fishery harbours and foreshore licensing agreements. There are five designated fishery harbours in the State, namely, Killybegs, Castletownbere, Rossaveel, Howth and Dunmore East. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to manage, control, operate and develop each fishery harbour centre. The Minister is also required by order of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 to keep an account of all moneys received or expended in connection with each harbour.</P><Col N="1772"/>
      <P>This year&rsquo;s report by the Comptroller and Auditor General raised the issue of the lack of accounts for the five centres for the years 2000 to 2003. It is a shocking indictment of the Minister that our five main harbours cannot keep proper accounts. Yet again the Government&rsquo;s mismanagement of public funds has been brought to the fore. External accountants had to be engaged in January this year to bring the accounts up to date. The ease with which this Government will spend our money is appalling. Why is an efficient, competent system not in place to ensure taxpayers&rsquo; money is not spent on outsourced accountants?</P>
      <P>The issue of debtors also shows how badly the harbours are managed and the level of priority this island nation accords its main fishery ports. The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for 1999 expressed concern about the amount of debts owed to the five harbours. External services were engaged in 2001 to assist with the collection of accumulated arrears. It is now claimed that a number of initiatives have been taken to enhance debt recovery at the harbours. While the Government has claimed that real progress has been achieved in increasing debt recovery levels, we need to examine the figures to find out the real picture.</P>
      <P>In Rossaveel, County Galway, the percentage of debt recovered compared with the total amount which should be collected has dramatically declined. In 1998, 80% of debt owed to the State was recovered, whereas the figure had sunk to a shockingly low 21% in 2004. This constitutes an astonishing drop of nearly 60% in the levels of debt recovered. Last year in Dunmore East only 32% of money owed was collected. In Howth, recovered debt levels declined from 70% in 1998 to 55% in 2004, a 15% drop during six years when the Government was supposedly more efficient in debt collection.</P>
      <P>As an island nation we must value our ports and harbours. The inefficiency of this Government indicates it has nothing but contempt for this valuable resource. In Rossaveel harbour charges are being resisted and legal action may be necessary to recover some of the money owed. No harbour master is in place in Dunmore East. To maximise the full potential of our five main fishery harbours we need to treat these areas and their problems as a top priority. Unfortunately, under this Government the harbours have been relegated to a low level. The Government&rsquo;s response to the serious concerns of our fishing fleet accounts for little more than lip-service.</P>
      <P>The Government lists a range of reasons our harbours have accumulated so many bad debts. The list consists of a series of basic problems facing our fishing fleet. I have been a strong advocate of adopting a sustainable policy for our fishing fleet to help combat these problems. Hiding behind the many difficulties fishermen are facing is no way for a Government to behave. Due to the many challenges the industry is facing, fishermen and their families will obviously not be able to deal with massive and surprising hikes in rents <Col N="1773"/>and charges but rents and charges at the harbours were increased in 2003 for the first time in 13 years. Considering the last price increase was in 1990, revenues had obviously not been keeping apace with costs and that is no way to run a successful harbour.</P>
      <P>There was obviously strong resistance from the fishing industry when these costs were introduced, especially given that their introduction coincided with new charges. How did the Government expect people to react? This is an industry on which many jobs depend, and on which we, as an island nation, depend enormously. The people behind the industry need to be treated with a great deal more respect than this Government gives them. It is an indictment of the Government that the fishery harbours, which are owned and managed by the State, are totally mismanaged. There has been little or no investment, except at Killybegs which has practically closed down.</P>
      <P>There has been not only horrendous inefficiency in the treatment of accounts but also a great deal of incompetence when dealing with roles, responsibilities and work practices at the harbours. While a substantial programme of change and modernisation was supposed to have taken place in this regard, the position at Killybegs, Howth and Dunmore East tells another story. All of these harbours are in disarray due to mismanagement at a ministerial level.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General has told us that there have been considerable difficulties in the filling of harbour master vacancies. That such high level jobs would be unwanted is evidence of the incompetence of the Government&rsquo;s handling of our nation&rsquo;s harbours. At present, harbour debts are calculated locally at three fishery harbour centres but because the harbours at Howth and Dunmore East are without harbour masters, the dues at these are left unattended. The level of collection of foreshore licensing fees is equally as bad but, unfortunately, I do not have time to go into that matter.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report is a clear document, independently assessed. It is an indictment of the Government&rsquo;s failure, yet again, to manage State assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who contributed to this debate over the past two nights. In particular, I thank our spokesperson, Deputy Burton, and the Fine Gael Party for co-sponsoring the motion.</P>
      <P>It has been an important and valuable debate. Indeed, it is regrettable that the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is not debated as a matter of course in the House each year. I know that the Committee of Public Accounts will now deal on a weekly basis with the detailed findings in the report but the conclusions and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General are of vital interest to all Members of the House, who should have the opportunity to speak on them</P><Col N="1774"/>
      <P>By any standards the 2004 report is a shocking document, containing, as it does, a long list of cases where the Government has simply failed to exert proper management over the spending of public funds or to ensure that taxpayers got value for their money.</P>
      <P>An equally important area of the report &mdash; one that perhaps did not got the attention it merited &mdash; was the further evidence it provided of continuing massive tax evasion by a number of mainly very wealthy people. In my experience most hard-working families accept the need to pay tax. They may not be enthusiastic about it, but they accept it is necessary in order to provide for the range of public services on which we all depend.</P>
      <P>There are two aspects that infuriate ordinary PAYE taxpayers. One is the realisation that while they are willing to pay their fair share, there are others who are willing to use every device &mdash; legal and illegal &mdash; to avoid making their contribution. Apart from the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the list of tax defaulters published every quarter by the Revenue Commissioners shows that despite amnesties, efforts to close loopholes and promises of clampdowns, there is still no shortage of people prepared to take a chance and evade paying the tax they owe.</P>
      <P>The other aspect that infuriates compliant taxpayers is the realisation that the euros, for which they worked so hard and which disappear each week or month from their pay cheques, end up being squandered. Indeed, any taxpayer who takes time out to read this year&rsquo;s report from the Comptroller and Auditor General can only react with blind fury at the litany of botched projects, management failures and examples of sheer incompetence revealed.</P>
      <P>The response of the various Ministers who have spoken in this debate has been quite revealing. The response of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, was surreal. The attitude seems to be, &ldquo;What are you getting so excited about? We have loads of money.&rdquo; The response of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on RTE radio this morning was a typical example. He stated that the &euro;166 million blown on the PPARS project was relatively small compared to the &euro;41 billion Government budget. There we are. What is &euro;166 million between a few extravagant Ministers? On second thoughts, I suppose that this attitude is not all that surprising, coming as it did from the father of the botched electronic voting system and virtually the last person in the country still prepared to go out and defend one of the greatest white elephants in the political history of the State.</P>
      <P>The tale of the HSE computer system that does not work despite more than &euro;150 million having been spent on it is just the latest, but also perhaps the most stark, example of the extraordinarily cavalier approach on the part of the Government to the waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. Full political responsibility for this waste rests with the three <Col N="1775"/>Ministers who have held the health portfolio while this saga was allowed develop. Why did the Ministers and their myriad advisers fail to exercise any supervision or control over this project? Why did nobody shout stop as the costs climbed and climbed?</P>
      <P>Nor can the various Ministers be allowed to pass the buck on to the Health Service Executive. This waste of money has its origins in decisions made well before the HSE was established. In addition, the HSE is the creation of the current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. If the HSE structure is proved inadequate, then she must bear political responsibility.</P>
      <P>The scale of the waste involved in this case beggars belief. The Taoiseach was correct this morning, of course, when he said that &euro;166 million would not build Tallaght Hospital nowadays but it would do a great deal. It would build a small to medium sized hospital. It would ensure the completion of Mullingar Hospital. It could provide an additional 150,000 full medical cards or it could ensure that everyone who needs a home help can get one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Instead, it appears that this money has been allowed to disappear into a financial black hole or, more accurately, into the bank accounts of the Government&rsquo;s favourite consultants.</P>
      <P>When a story like the PPARS fiasco emerges taxpayers expect three actions. They expect the Taoiseach, as head of Government, to acknowledge that a problem exists and that errors have been made, they expect that somebody will come forward and accept responsibility at political level for such a waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money and they expect a commitment from Government that steps will be taken to ensure that lessons are learned and that there will be no repeat of such waste of money. Instead the reaction of the Taoiseach has been to circle the wagons, deny that there is any problem and try to bamboozle the public and the D&aacute;il with waffle. This side of the House has not been taken in and the public will not be taken in either.</P>
      <P>There are other areas of concern about waste within the Department of Health and Children. There are reports about other computer systems within the Department which are causing similar difficulties.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report also raised questions about the national treatment purchase fund and the Labour Party has called for a complete review of this scheme. It is astonishing to find that 36% of patients dealt with under the NTPF were referred for private treatment in the same hospital for which they were <Col N="1776"/>waiting for public treatment. This confirms that public hospitals are being prevented from working at full capacity because of budgetary constraints.</P>
      <P>I remind the Government that when this scheme was originally announced with such great fanfare by the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party warned of the danger that we would end up paying hospital consultants twice for treating the same patient and that is exactly what has been happening. I was always sceptical about the NTPF plan because it seemed to me that the needs of patients would be far better met by investing in public hospital services rather than diverting millions into the private hospital system, and certainly we would expect to get better value for money.</P>
      <P>Following the issues raised in his report, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be asked to undertake a value for money audit of the entire NTPF scheme before we continue on the road the Minister for Health and Children seems determined to take towards privatising large sections of the health service.</P>
      <P>There is real anger among taxpayers at the ongoing waste of their money by the Government. That concern will have been greatly exacerbated by the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the disclosures regarding PPARS. Ministers are custodians of taxpayers&rsquo; money. They must ensure the money is well spent and not wasted on vanity schemes or ill-conceived or poorly thought out projects. This Government has failed miserably in this regard. It must be compelled to bring forward proposals to improve the system of public expenditure decision making, to get better value for taxpayers; money and to the tackle the ongoing waste of public money.</P>
      <P>I assure the Government that this side of the House is determined, when we return after the next general election, not just to be in Government, but to be in a better Government that will deliver value for money and excellent public services. What concerns me more than anything is that many of these projects meant significant amounts of money were lost.</P>
      <P>In terms of the health service it was not just money that was lost. I have no doubt that lives were lost because money was not spent where it was most needed. People were left on trolleys or endless waiting lists trying to access the care they needed. Families were unable to get a medical card. Our hospitals are dirty and there is insufficient investment to deal with MRSA. Many of us know people who have suffered from the bug. A friend of mine died from it. These are the kind of changes that could have been delivered by a Government committed to ensuring quality public services delivered on the basis of efficiency and value for money. We now have a record of this Government&rsquo;s total failure to do so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this issue after the family involved has exhausted every avenue in trying to seek a resolution to it. The background to the case, with which I believe the T&aacute;naiste if not the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is familiar, is that Mr. Keeshan has suffered from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease for the last 15 years. He does not recognise his family and needs full-time care and attention. He is still physically mobile and requires increased care as a result. He is in St. Conlon&rsquo;s Hospital in Nenagh and his family are anxious that he be allocated a bed at the community nursing unit in Birr.</P>
        <P>Nenagh is 23 miles from their home whereas Birr is less than two miles away. The man&rsquo;s children live either at the family home or in Birr and they pass through Birr each day as they travel to and from work. The family is very much from Birr. They all went to primary and post primary school in Birr, go to mass and shop there and are part of Birr parish. It is very much their home.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley is familiar with hurling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very familiar with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>If this man was to hurl, he would have to hurl for Offaly and not for his own county. His address is Riverstown, Birr, County Offaly, but this is actually physically in County Tipperary. This is where his problem lies.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive for the midland area will not consider him for a bed in Birr as he is outside their area. However, even this is not clear cut. The former chief officer of the HSE midland area in a letter in regard to this case stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">There is a need at all times to adopt a flexible approach to matters of this nature. In the past it was the policy of all health boards that where boundaries cut through natural catchment areas or indeed where individuals were disadvantaged by particular boundaries a flexible approach would be adopted.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I ask the Minister of State whether this was or is the case, which is the first point that needs to be clarified.</P>
        <P>The chief officer then goes on to state that Birr was Mr. Keeshan&rsquo;s community focal point. The letter states: &ldquo;With the Government decision to abolish health boards and health board boundaries there is an even greater emphasis on adopting a flexible approach to such matters into the future.&rdquo; Is this an accurate statement? His letter goes on to make it clear that these points form part of the general policy framework of the HSE. <Col N="1782"/>Like him, I thought the abolition of health boards would at least mean that decisions I can only describe as cold, heartless bureaucracy would no longer form part of our health service. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for this family.</P>
        <P>I am aware the HSE has offered subvention for Mr. Keeshan to attend a private nursing home in County Offaly but the family have already tried this and found it totally unsuited to his needs. He is at his most content when he can be outside in a garden. He requires little care at these times but he does require to be in a place that he cannot leave. I do not want to use the word &ldquo;escape&rdquo;, which would be accurate. Birr community nursing unit offers such a place. His family naturally want to see their father as often as possible and take a very active role in his care but they cannot do this while he remains where he is.</P>
        <P>We were promised a people-centred health service but this case does not meet that standard. This is a decision based on nothing more than a line on a map showing a boundary when we supposedly have one Health Service Executive and boundaries were thought to be a thing of the past. Even if they still exist, where is the flexibility that we need to ensure a proper caring health service?</P>
        <P>I raise this matter in the hope that the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste can understand the sense of the argument I make. I am not asking for interference but for common sense to be adopted. If the line exists, at the least arrangements should be put in place for people living in boundary areas, as described by the former chief officer. This matter has been allowed to drag on for a considerable time and needs to be resolved for the sake of the patient concerned and his family. I ask the Minister to intervene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this Adjournment matter of behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank the Deputy for raising the question as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current situation.</P>
        <P>The Department made inquiries of the Health Service Executive regarding the issue raised by the Deputy. The HSE informed the Department that there are no vacant beds in the nursing unit to which the Deputy refers and that the facility in question has a waiting list of 25 people at present. I have been further informed that the patient is receiving care in another HSE community nursing unit which is approximately 28 miles from the patient&rsquo;s home. The HSE recognises that the patient&rsquo;s family has difficulty in visiting him at that facility and has offered to provide a private nursing home bed in a facility approximately ten miles from the patient&rsquo;s family home. To date the patient&rsquo;s family have not accepted this offer. The <Col N="1783"/>HSE has met the patient&rsquo;s family in the past and is happy to do so again to review the matter.</P>
        <P>It is worthwhile to point out that a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established following on from the publication of the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken for that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group has been requested to report to both the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I understand this report is due shortly. Following this process it is the intention that there will be discussions with relevant interest groups in regard to the proposals for the future financing of long-term care.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children is reviewing the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme and the legislation and regulations underpinning it. It is intended to bring legislation to Government in this regard later this year. Part of reviewing the subvention system will be to update the thresholds contained in the 1993 nursing home regulations, which have not been updated since being set in 1993 and which warrant updating given the rising cost of living and property in the past 12 years.</P>
        <P>The Department is also undertaking a comprehensive review of eligibility for services generally, including services for older persons and related legislation. This is the first major review in this area since the passing of the 1970 Health Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>This night three weeks ago a large public meeting was held in Clonmel on hospital services for the county. As the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley knows, the issue has been outstanding for quite some time. As far back as 1996 there was a High Court agreement for the provision of services on the Cashel and Clonmel sites. The Minister and the Department have not implemented that agreement. While work has been done and some units have been built on both sites, some of those units have remained idle for several years.</P>
      <P>The meeting to which I referred was a large one at which all the Oireachtas Members from the county, hospital staff, health professionals, members of the public and members of all the local authorities in the county attended. The meeting was above politics since this issue is looked on as such in South Tipperary. It unites <Col N="1784"/>all public representatives and Oireachtas Members in the county. As a result of that meeting my colleagues have been in touch with the T&aacute;naiste requesting that she meet a deputation of Oireachtas Members and chairmen or mayors of local authorities in the county. I hope the T&aacute;naiste will agree to that meeting sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, a number of units have been completed at Cashel. However, due to a lack of funding, they are not up and running. Not only that, but on the Cashel site, the Health Service Executive is waiting for approval to go to the tender process in phase two of the development. That development will include a 25-bed geriatric rehabilitation unit, a 20-bed GP assessment unit, a 15-bed nursing unit and convalescent unit, a five-bed palliative care unit and a 15-bed day hospital for the elderly. As it stands, none of those units have been built. The HSE is not in a position to go to tender because it has not got approval to do so.</P>
      <P>While &euro;30 million has been spent providing state-of-the-art facilities at the Clonmel site those units have remained idle for nearly three years because moneys have not been provided to ensure the transfer of the general surgical services to Clonmel. There is also considerable disappointment on the Clonmel site about the failure to commence the process of planning for phase two of the development there. That development will include refurbishing the maternity and gynaecology wards, new paediatric and acute psychiatric wards, a cardiac centre, an acute medical unit, an outpatient department and a day hospital for the elderly.</P>
      <P>There is considerable disquiet in South Tipperary on this issue which unites the whole county including Oireachtas Members and politicians of all persuasions and none. There is growing concern, as that public meeting showed. A further report-back public meeting will be held in mid-November to find out the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s response. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us the T&aacute;naiste will meet a deputation from the county on this issue and that we can move forward with the development and the provision of services in Cashel and Clonmel as envisaged in the High Court agreement of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Healy for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the current situation in South Tipperary. The Deputy is aware of the background to the existing situation in respect of services at South Tipperary General Hospital and at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital in Cashel.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached in 1996 to amalgamate acute services in South Tipperary requiring the transfer of surgical and accident and emergency services from Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Cashel, to South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel. This <Col N="1785"/>agreement provided for the development of services for older people, disability services, palliative care services and mental health services on the Cashel site. It is planned to complete the developments in Cashel in two phases. Phase 1, costing approximately &euro;12 million, has now been completed along with the design stage of phase 2.</P>
      <P>In recent years, significant capital investment of &euro;30 million has been provided for the new facilities in the phase 1 development at South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel.</P>
      <P>In September 2004 the Department of Health and Children, in the context of commissioning new units in acute hospitals throughout the country, gave approval to the then South Eastern Health Board to commission the new facilities in Clonmel. In 2005, ongoing revenue funding of &euro;3.8 million is available to the HSE, south eastern area, to open the new facilities at South Tipperary General Hospital. This year funding of &euro;1.3 million was provided towards the development of the Cashel sector headquarters, day hospital-day centre and a new 12-bed community residence and work is currently in progress to develop this service.</P>
      <P>It is clear that significant capital and revenue funding has already been provided to develop services in the South Tipperary hospitals. The development of Cashel phase 2 is contingent on the transfer of surgical services to Clonmel and the provision of capital funding for the project. Phase 2 of the developments at Clonmel must also be considered in the context of the health capital investment framework.</P>
      <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the provision of services at Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Cashel, and South Tipperary General Hospital, Clonmel. I understand a number of industrial relations issues are being addressed by the HSE in relation to the transfer of surgical services from Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Cashel, to St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel. Provision of the necessary funding for the hospitals at Clonmel and Cashel is now a matter to be considered by the HSE in the context of the resources available to develop the services there.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has already agreed to meet Oireachtas Members on this matter. Arrangements are being made with the Health Service Executive in this regard.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Earlier in the summer I began to receive telephone calls from a number of old age pensioners in local authority senior citizens complexes in my constituency. To say they were in a state of panic would be an understatement. One by one they had received notice that their fuel allowance was to be removed. The paltry sum of &euro;12.90 per week for 29 weeks of the year which they had come to enjoy and which gave them a little comfort over the winter months was to be removed from them. This was totally unexpected and out of the blue. It would appear they are being picked off one by one &mdash; people who collectively have no voice because they are not able to organise themselves together to have a voice on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senior citizens complexes in my constituency include Fr. Kitt Court, Rockmead and Lissadell. I have had queries from each of the complexes on the removal of this fuel allowance. It is about the meanest and sneakiest cut in social welfare that I have encountered. It is worse than those relating to the savage 16 last year. The amount of money involved is minuscule against the background of the debate we had last night and tonight. I appeal to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to reverse this decision. I have written to him specifically regarding a number of cases but I have no doubt many more people over the coming weeks will also find that they are in the net and that their little fuel allowance is to be removed from them. I appeal to the Minister of State to reverse this miserable decision and to return to them the fuel allowance for that part of the year when they so badly need that extra money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This is one of the meanest and cruellest types of bookkeeping and accountancy. It is coming from the same administration that can manage to lose millions of euro elsewhere in the public budget but still has the energy and capacity to scrutinise the &euro;6 weekly contribution on top of rent in special senior citizens accommodation as their contribution towards the heating bill. Somebody somewhere spotted they were making this contribution but that it was not the full cost and has reduced the heating allowance accordingly. It is mind-boggling in its meanness. It is astounding in its attention to detail at a time when the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources claimed on radio this morning that the loss of &euro;170 million was chickenfeed in the context of an annual &euro;40 billion budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children will realise the health contribution which secure and well-insulated heated accommodation provides for elderly people. Taking away this facility from pensioners to augment <Col N="1787"/>their heating could mean they get sick and present themselves to hospitals, meaning no overall saving to the health budget. This is meanness personified which represents all the characteristics of this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards meeting their additional heating needs during the winter season. Under the scheme a fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week is paid to eligible households during a 29-week winter heating period from end-September to mid-April each year. An additional &euro;3.90 per week is payable in designated urban smokeless fuel zones.</P>
      <P>Approximately 274,000 households receive a fuel allowance, at an expected cost of &euro;85.4 million this year. In addition to fuel allowance, over 300,000 pensioners and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005.</P>
      <P>There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. To qualify for an allowance under the national fuel scheme, an applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, live alone or only with a dependent spouse, partner or children or with other eligible recipients. As a long-standing policy within the scheme, fuel allowances are not payable in cases where a person is able to provide for their heating needs from their own resources through, for example, access to his or her own fuel supply or benefiting from subsidised heating services such as those provided by Dublin City Council at several of its housing complexes.</P>
      <P>In Dublin City Council&rsquo;s communally heated dwellings, the cost to tenants for subsidised heating starts at &euro;300 per year for a one roomed flat and increases <i>pro rata</i> depending on the number of rooms and the particular complex. The amount paid by tenants per week is on average &euro;6 to &euro;7. The subsidised heating is available from September to May inclusive, approximately ten weeks longer than the duration of the national fuel scheme which runs for 29 weeks from September to mid-April. To ease the burden on the tenant, payments to the corporation are spread over 52 weeks. In addition to heating each room in the flats, the local authority also provides hot water 24 hours a day, each day of the year, the charge for which is also included in the above costs. The central heating provided is not optional. Subsidised heating tends to be available mainly in the older flat-type complexes operated <Col N="1788"/>by the local authorities, rather than the new individual units being constructed which typically have their own individual heating systems.</P>
      <P>As part of ongoing claim management by the Department, a project to identify customers in receipt of both subsidised heating and fuel allowance was carried out by certain departmental sections during 2005. A review of addresses at which heating is provided at low cost by Dublin City Council identified 237 customers at different local authority complexes who had been paid the fuel allowance in error. The allowance was terminated in all of these cases and as from 29-30 September 2005, the start of the new winter heating season. The non-payment of fuel allowance for these customers arises purely from the proper application of the existing long-standing conditions for the fuel allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>Where customers have been in receipt of the fuel allowance in error on this basis, there is no question of any overpayments being assessed against them. Pensioners and other social welfare groups have received significant increases in their welfare payment rates in this and recent years. This has improved their income situation considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. These higher rates of primary payments are payable for a full 52 weeks of the year. The issue of fuel allowance not being available to claimants with subsidised heating is under review in the Department.</P>

	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, and the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>The rise of anti-social behaviour in our towns and villages, manifesting itself as vandalism and hooliganism, is a national issue but it is being ignored by the Government. Taking the specific example of Kilrush in County Clare, it has been subject in recent weeks to a spate of vandalism attacks on cars, houses and one bus. These include arson attacks, the smashing of windscreens and the damaging of car bodyworks. The result is that elderly people now fear for their safety and worry about their property. They are afraid to go out at night. Parents are fearful when their children are out. People&rsquo;s livelihoods are affected and the town&rsquo;s reputation as a maritime and heritage centre, attractive for tourism and new business, is affected. It is hard enough for any town in Ireland, let alone a town on the west coast, to attract industry and tourism without having its reputation tarnished for an excessively long time due to lack of action at a national level.</P>
        <P>Kilrush has a population of 2,700 and is earmarked for decentralisation. Despite, the Government&rsquo;s mishandling of that process, <Col N="1789"/>Kilrush is oversubscribed. However, its rightful place as the capital of west County Clare is unfairly affected.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>There has been some success by local garda&iacute; in making arrests on this specific issue but this will not be the end of the matter. This issue has been allowed to fester, as have countless similar ones in other towns and villages, where small groups, usually of juveniles, run riot at night and cause thousands of euro of damage. This must be stopped.</P>
        <P>I am calling on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to draw up a strategic plan to tackle such problems, using the resources of a special Garda unit to assist local efforts in dealing with the ongoing and escalating acts of vandalism and anti-social behaviour in Kilrush. Special operations such as Operation Anvil, targeting drugs and crime sprees in Dublin and Limerick, have met with success. What is needed in Kilrush is a similar operation but on a reduced scale where Garda expertise in tackling an entrenched problem is brought to bear. A special but temporary operation that was, in the words of the Minister, focused, sustained, targeted and relentless would augment the existing Garda presence in Kilrush of 27 members.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed me the special needs of towns like Kilrush are being taken into account when plans are drawn up to distribute and manage the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; to be recruited to tackle areas with crime problems. I welcome the appointment of a new superintendent in the area. I hope during his stay he will have success in dealing with these problems. However, the people of Clare are tired of the Government replacing action with the drawing up of plans and consideration of approaches. It simply is not good enough.</P>
        <P>In many towns there is an emerging crime culture with career criminals in the making. An urgent response is required now if these problems are not to mushroom out of control and cost taxpayers millions of euro in the future. A mix of overt and covert operations on a small scale would yield huge results. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with this problem and take into account what has happened. The relative cost of such special efforts would be small in contrast to the long-term cost of such vandalism going unchecked and the ultimate bill of sending offenders to prison for lengthy periods.</P>
        <P>The State has a duty to intervene early in such cases on both monetary and social grounds. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has been advised repeatedly by experts in the area that moneys spent on Youthreach and similar intervention schemes pay enormous dividends. This contrasts with massive cost overruns when buying sites for prisons, let alone building such prisons and housing the prisoners.</P><Col N="1790"/>
        <P>Many of these problems have emerged from housing estates which the State has decided to abandon. From the beginning, it failed to provide adequate planning, neglected community facilities and dropped the word &ldquo;playground&rdquo; from its vocabulary. When teenagers in such estates begin to go out of control, there is an even greater responsibility on the State to provide enlightened intervention schemes before another generation is lost to society as useful citizens. I call on the Minister to make a special effort in towns like Kilrush to sort out the anti-social problems that have people living in fear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Pat Breen for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am aware of his interest in this subject. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to be present. I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I share his concerns and those of the residents of Kilrush in this matter.</P>
        <P>Strong provisions are already in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, because of the Minister&rsquo;s concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, he brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the Act&rsquo;s provisions is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Minister takes great satisfaction in the Government&rsquo;s decision last October to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional garda&iacute; to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. In particular, the programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, while it will also be possible to address other priorities such as the need to increase sig<Col N="1791"/>nificantly the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. One promise the Minister has already made is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</P>
        <P>The Minister is pleased to state that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is now better resourced than at any time in its history. The Garda budget is now at an historic high of over &euro;1.1 billion, representing an increase of 85% in the provision since 1997 when the provision stood at just &euro;600 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister was pleased to note a reduction in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 12% reduction in assaults causing harm in the second quarter compared with the same period last year.</P>
        <P>The Minister believes the courts can give valuable support and protection to our communities in tackling anti-social behaviour. In this regard he is finalising legislative proposals to provide for anti-social behaviour orders. The Minister also intends, subject to Government approval, to introduce these proposals as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. Anti-social behaviour orders are not a radical new legal concept. It is a deeply rooted principle of our law that persons should be able to apply to the courts for protection against behaviour which interferes with their basic rights. As a principle, it is very similar to the existing power of the courts to bind over a person to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal will allow the Garda to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which will prohibit the person who is the subject of the order from behaving in an anti-social way. The orders will be civil orders and the question of an offence will arise only if the person in question wilfully defies the order and continues to engage in the anti-social behaviour which is the subject of the order. The Minister believes that anti-social behaviour orders used in the most glaring cases will be of real value in curbing this type of behaviour.</P>
        <P>I also draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to section 29 of the Bill which provides for a fixed penalty procedure for lesser public order offences. This procedure will apply to certain offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 dealing with intoxication and disorderly conduct in a public place.</P>
        <P>The Minister attaches great importance to the development of a real partnership between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities on matters affecting policing. His intention and that of the <Col N="1792"/>Oireachtas, as set out in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, is that joint policing committees and local policing fora established under them will provide arenas where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authorities can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues.</P>
        <P>The Act provides that the committees will be mandated to keep under review the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in the local authority area, including the patterns and levels of misuse of alcohol and drugs and the factors underlying and contributing to those levels of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour. Local policing fora will discuss and make recommendations concerning these matters as they affect their specific neighbourhoods. These are significant innovations which will strengthen policing at local level and create strong partnerships. They will ensure that the new committees and their structures will provide permanent fora to address the issue of anti-social behaviour.</P>
        <P>I have referred to legislation which the Minister has already introduced to combat the abuse of alcohol and the public order problems to which it gives rise. In addition, the Minister has recently published the general scheme of the proposed intoxicating liquor bill, which will carry forward this work. The main purpose of the proposed Bill is to streamline and modernise our liquor licensing laws.</P>
        <P>With regard to Kilrush, the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that a special operation is in place there to assist local garda&iacute; in their efforts to prevent and detect acts of criminality in the locality. Resources from throughout the Clare division have been and will continue to be utilised in this operation. Within the past week, one individual has been charged with four acts of criminal damage to cars in the town and is in custody. The Minister is further informed that one additional sergeant and two additional garda&iacute; were recently deployed to Kilrush to augment resources. The present special operation will be continually reviewed and additional resources will be deployed if the necessity arises.</P>
        <P>This Government is strongly committed to the reduction and prevention of crime through strong and effective crime prevention methods. However, I cannot stress enough that while legislative measures can help to curtail the problem of anti-social behaviour, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. All those with an interest in this area must play their role in helping to address the problems of vandalism and anti-social behaviour in society.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Public procurement of computer systems operates within a policy defined by European and domestic procurement law. Up to date guidelines for public procurement, including information technology solutions, were issued to Departments and offices by my Department in 2004. I am satisfied that the procurement systems in place are robust and as a general rule operate in a satisfactory manner. However, this is a matter that my Department keeps under review and it is currently developing a peer review process for large computer projects that will be introduced in 2006. This will bring to bear the experiences of senior computer managers across the Civil Service to evaluate the viability of project proposals, determine the best implementation method and review progress at critical stages.</P>
        <P>The specification, design and implementation of computer-IT systems can be quite complex and challenging. There are many examples of good implementations of such systems throughout the public service. Unfortunately, however, there are also examples where projects can and do run into difficulties for a variety of reasons. Sometimes delays occur because of a change in requirements or scope or because something arose that was not foreseen. Sometimes, unfortunately, expenditure overruns arise from poor planning and poor decision making in an individual organisation.</P>
        <P>Issues in relation to the two health systems came to my Department&rsquo;s attention in the context of the establishment of the HSE and the new financial arrangements put in place earlier this year. The ICT allocation became subject to the controls and constraints that already apply to spending on computing in Departments and offices. My Department became aware of very large expenditures on both of these systems, including what <Col N="1794"/>seemed to be a very heavy reliance on external consultancy. My Department was also concerned about a decision to adopt an approach to data take-on which seemed to be overly complex and expensive.</P>
        <P>My Department brought its concerns to the attention of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE and requested a review of both systems with a view to identifying less complex approaches to completing their implementation and their subsequent ongoing operation. I understand that such a review is now under way within the HSE.</P>
        <P>More generally, the HR management system is in successful and widespread use throughout the Civil Service. It is based on the market leading software which is modified to cater for the specific needs of the Civil Service. It is a system that is seen as critical to the better management of HR resources within the Civil Service. The latest version, for example, includes features to allow recording of flexible working arrangements and their consequences for pensionable service.</P>
        <P>I note that there have been issues concerning the suitability of this system for the Prison Service and this has been highlighted in the recent Comptroller and Auditor General annual report. Any future decisions for a replacement HR system in the Prison Service will be subjected to the proposed peer review mechanism I already referred to.</P>

	<P>The stallion stud fee exemption was introduced in the Finance Act 1969 and amended in 1985. The stallion relief was included as part of annual reports on aid granted in Ireland to the agriculture sector sent by the Department of Agriculture to the Commission in 1982 and on a number of subsequent occasions. The Commission wrote to the Irish authorities on 24 June 2003 stating that a complaint had been received in relation to the relief and asked that full details on the exemption be sent to the Commission in order for it to be assessed as a potential State aid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In a subsequent letter of 6 January 2005 to the Irish authorities, the Commission indicated that it had come to a preliminary conclusion that the stallion tax exemption would seem to constitute an aid scheme that is not compatible with the Common Market. The letter set out the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning and, against that background, invited Ireland to submit comments within one month together with any concrete proposals regarding how the scheme in question could be brought in line with Article 87 of the EC Treaty.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food met with officials from the Commission Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development on 23 February 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, met with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels on 12 May last on this matter. At this meeting, I outlined the background to the relief and the development of the industry in Ireland over the past 30 years setting out the contribution of the horse breeding industry here to employment and economic activity particularly in rural areas. I also made the point to the Commissioner that while I fully understood the Commission&rsquo;s obligation to examine the relief on foot of the complaint it had received, it would be worthwhile if the broader European and international aspects of this issue were taken into account. In particular, I asked that care should be taken not to disadvantage the Irish horse breeding industry, which is recognised as being a cornerstone of the wider European industry, relative to competitors from around the world.</P>
        <P>I have reported on these discussions to my colleagues in Government and further correspondence with the Commission has been continuing over recent months, with the most recent communication being a letter from me to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on 28 September 2005. However, the issues involved in relation to the tax exemption for stallion stud fee income are still under consideration. In the normal course, any proposals for change in tax exemptions are considered in the context of the annual budget.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter of random audits, including the purpose and methodology, has been the subject of discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts committee following examination of this issue by the Comptroller and Auditor General. As a consequence, in December 2003, the Revenue Commissioners gave a commitment to the Committee of Public Accounts that they would undertake a review of their random audit programme with a view to improving the methodology so that it would be possible over time to extrapolate figures regarding underlying tax compliance from the audit results. Pending this review the traditional random audit programme was not continued for the year 2004 although some cases selected in earlier years were concluded.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The promised review was carried out in late 2003 and during 2004 and following that a new random audit programme called the tax compliance testing programme was rolled out in November 2004. This programme is currently in use and, for 2005, on the basis of purely random case selection, is being used to test tax compliance.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a programme which is dealing in a very determined way with tax evasion by maximising the impact of their resources through focusing on risk. This is strengthened by their new tax compliance testing programme, which ensures that all of our taxpayers will be exposed to the possibility of a compliance check or Revenue audit. This approach is in line with international best practice.</P>

	<P>Section 50 of Finance Act 2004 provided for the introduction of a limited scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the provision was to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel. As the Deputy may be aware, it was necessary to obtain approval from the EU Commission as the proposed scheme represented a State aid. Approval was granted in March 2005 and the scheme was subsequently advertised by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Excise relief was granted to successful applicants to the scheme from August 2005 for a total of 16 million litres of fuel.</P>
        <P>The current scheme includes excise relief on ethanol production up to a limit of 2 million litres. It is up to the project promoter to choose the most appropriate feedstock to produce the ethanol. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that Maxol, the producer of the 2 million litres of bioethanol under the current scheme, is sourcing the ethanol from the by-products of cow&rsquo;s milk.</P><Col N="1799"/>

	<P>The Government decision on carbon tax was made in September 2004 following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associ<Col N="1800"/>ated environmental, economic and social impacts. In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received.</P>
        <P>Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P>The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of recent increases in international oil prices.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising. Moreover a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not specifically necessary to increase tax rates.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>
        <P>The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government&rsquo;s approach to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed.</P>
        <P>Taxation can play a part in attaining environment objectives. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that in developing policy on tax measures we take into account any effects on Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness, particularly in relation to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Apart from the carbon tax, the national climate change strategy does envisage other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for &lsquo;green initiatives&rsquo;. Essentially this approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour. Such examples include capital allowances for corporate investment in renewable energy projects, which have been available since 1998, and a provision in Finance Act 2004 which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>As far as the ESRI report is concerned, the report concentrated on energy policy in relation to electricity and gas and looked at other fuels only in the context of electricity generation. While the ESRI proposes the introduction of a carbon tax, I can confirm, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government <Col N="1801"/>has already stated, that the Government decision of September 2004 is not scheduled for review. The Deputy&rsquo;s question infers that the economy would be better off with a carbon tax. However, to pursue policies that would increase taxes on transport fuels and home heating oils, at this time, would have negative economic consequences.</P>

	<P>The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002. The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007. A total of 1.17 million accounts were opened during the period outlined.</P>
        <P>The impact of maturing SSIA funds on the economy in 2006 and 2007 is subject to ongoing consideration within my Department. The impact on consumer demand is difficult to estimate and will depend on how the accumulated savings are spent or saved, how that portion of an individual&rsquo;s income that was previously saved in SSIAs is used, and the extent to which savings are rolled over into other investment products. The economic effect will also depend on the state of the economy in 2007, when the bulk of SSIA funds mature. To date, a number of reports have been prepared regarding the impact of the SSIAs by, among others, Goodbody Stockbrokers, Lansdowne Market Research, the Irish Mortgage Corporation and the Bank of Ireland. However, there is no consensus in these reports as to how these funds may be used. It is inevitable that there will be a lot of uncertainty about the likely outcomes. As a scheme such as the SSIA has not existed previously, it is not possible to draw on experience as a basis for anticipating the impact the maturing accounts will have on the economy.</P>
        <P>Tax revenue is a product of the level and composition of economic growth. Whatever assessment is made by my Department of the likely economic impact of maturing special savings investment accounts, SSIAs, next year will be reflected in the tax forecast for 2006 which will be published in budget 2006. Any impact on tax revenues arising from the economic impact of maturing SSIAs will be once-off.</P>

	<P Just="Left">As the Deputy is aware, in my 2005 Budget Statement, I announced that my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners would undertake a detailed review of certain tax incentive schemes and tax exemptions in 2005. This review was to evaluate their impact and operation including their economic and social benefits for the different locations and sectors involved and to the wider community. In addition the review was to examine the degree to which these schemes allow high-income individuals to reduce their tax liabilities.</P>
        <P>I subsequently announced in a press release on 6 January 2005 that my Department had advertised for external consultants to review certain property tax incentive schemes. On 9 April 2005, I announced the award of two external consultancy contracts for the reviews. Following a detailed examination of the qualifying tenders by a special interdepartmental group, the successful candidates were Goodbody Economic Consultants in respect of the area-based urban renewal, town renewal, rural renewal and the living-over-the-shop schemes and Indecon Economic Consultants for the sectoral property tax incentive schemes, namely, multi-storey carparks, park and ride facilities, student accommodation, third level buildings, hotels, holiday cottages, nursing homes, private hospitals, sports injuries clinics, child care facilities and refurbishment of rented residential accommodation.</P>
        <P>The complete reports from the consultants will be received shortly. On this basis, the reviews will be completed in time for consideration in the context of the 2006 budget and the Finance Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by Revenue Commissioners that the following information provides the up to date position on court prosecutions initiated for tax evasion: In 1997, there was one prosecution initiated for tax evasion. A fine of &euro;635 was imposed with no custodial sentence. In 1998, there were six cases initiated and eight convictions secured and fines totalling &euro;42,854 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of six months suspended and one of two years suspended. In 1999, there were two cases. In one case, a fine of &euro;19,046 was imposed with no custodial sentence and in the other, the defendant was acquitted. In 2000, three cases were initiated and three convictions were secured. Fines totalling &euro;952 were imposed. There were two custodial sentences, one of two years, reduced to 18 months on appeal, and another of 12 months suspended. In 2001, there were four cases and fines totalling &euro;14,284 were imposed. There were four custodial sentences, one of 12 months, two of six months suspended and another of three months. In 2002, there were three cases initiated and three convictions secured. Fines totalling &euro;5,540 were imposed and one custodial sentence of six months suspended. In 2003, there were six cases initiated and seven convictions secured. Fines totalling &euro;29,365 were imposed and one custodial sentence of two years suspended. In 2004, there was one case, a fine of &euro;5,000 was imposed and 180 hours community service was imposed in lieu of a three months custodial sentence. In 2005 to date, there have been 12 cases initiated. In six of these cases sentence has been passed and the other six are still in the court process, including one case <Col N="1805"/>adjourned awaiting sentence. In the six cases where sentence has been handed down, fines totalling &euro;170,400 have been imposed and two custodial sentences, one of three months and one of 16 months, have been imposed. In addition, sentences of 240 hours and 120 hours community service were imposed in two cases in lieu of custodial sentences. An appeal has been lodged by one individual against his conviction, sentence and order.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a clear policy of prosecuting cases of serious tax evasion. This function is tasked to their investigations and prosecutions division. Following the restructuring of Revenue in 2003, all investigation activity was consolidated in this division with a remit to co-ordinate all Revenue prosecution work and, in particular, to increase the number of criminal investigations for serious tax offences and ultimately to increase the number of prosecutions. The number of investigators was also increased for this purpose.</P>
        <P>The most recent figures indicate that this approach is proving successful. There are currently 52 cases under investigation for potential prosecution. The Director of Public Prosecutions is considering a further 12 cases and has given directions to prosecute in another four. Bench warrants have been issued in two cases for failure to attend court and, as I have stated, six cases are in the court process. Combined with the six successful prosecutions to date in 2005, of which the conviction and sentence in one case is under appeal, it is the highest overall figure to date and vindicates the decision to concentrate Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; prosecution resources in one area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>As I have already outlined to the House, the stallion stud fee exemption was introduced in Finance Act 1969 and amended in 1985. The stallion relief was included as part of annual reports on <Col N="1806"/>aid granted in Ireland to the agriculture sector sent by the Department of Agriculture to the Commission in 1982 and on a number of subsequent occasions. The Commission wrote to the Irish authorities on 24 June 2003 stating that a complaint had been received in relation to the relief and asked that full details on the exemption be sent to the Commission in order for it to be assessed as a potential State aid.</P>
        <P>In a subsequent letter of 6 January 2005 to the Irish authorities, the Commission indicated that they had come to a preliminary conclusion that the stallion tax exemption would seem to constitute an aid scheme that is not compatible with the Common Market. The letter set out the Commission&rsquo;s reasoning and, against that background, invited Ireland to submit comments within one month together with any concrete proposals regarding how the scheme in question could be brought in line with Article 87 of the EC Treaty.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food met with officials from the Commission Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development on 23 February 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I, along with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, met with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development in Brussels on 12 May last on this matter. At this meeting, I outlined the background to the relief and the development of the industry in Ireland over the past 30 years setting out the importance of the horse breeding industry here in terms of its contribution to employment and economic activity particularly in rural areas. I also took the opportunity to advise the Commission that, while I fully understood the Commission&rsquo;s obligation to examine the relief on foot of the complaint it had received, it is necessary that the broader European and international aspects of this issue should be taken into account. In particular, care should be taken not to disadvantage the Irish horse breeding industry, which is recognised as being a cornerstone of the European industry, relative to competitors from around the world.</P>
        <P>I have reported on these discussions to my colleagues in Government and further correspondence with the Commission has been continuing over recent months, with the most recent communication being a letter from me to the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on 28 September 2005. However, the issues involved in relation to the tax exemption for stallion stud fee income are still under consideration, and I understand that the Commission has not yet concluded its deliberations on the matter. In the normal course, any proposals for change in tax exemptions are considered in the context of the annual budget.</P>

        <Quest>when the Government will honour the commitment given in An Agreed Programme for Government that 80% of all earners will pay tax only at the standard rate in view of the fact that the proportion of taxpayers paying at the higher rate is expected to increase from 32.61% in 2004 to 33.17% in 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government programme, An Agreed Programme for Government, states that &ldquo;over the next five years our priorities ...will be ... to ensure that 80% of all earners pay tax only at the standard rate&rdquo;. The five year period mentioned commenced three years ago when the Government were elected to office. I should also point out, however, that the commitment is given in the context of a broader economic and budgetary strategy which provides, among other things, that the public finances will be kept in a healthy condition and that personal and business taxes will be kept down in order to strengthen and maintain the competitive position of the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The position is that had the standard rate bands not been widened to the extent that they were in budget 2005, 35.9% of income earners would have been paying tax at the higher rate in 2005. The effect of the budget was to reduce the proportion to 33.2%. Indeed, the latest information from the Revenue Commissioners, using base data for 2002 adjusted for estimated growth in numbers in employment and wage levels, indicate that for 2005 the proportion of earners on the higher rate of tax will be less than 33%.</P>
        <P>Further progress in this area will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual budgets over the next number of years consistent with the Government&rsquo;s overall economic and budgetary strategy. However, I would remind the Deputy that, since 1997, average tax rates have fallen for all categories of taxpayer. For example, the average tax rate, that is, income tax, PRSI and health levy combined for the person on the average industrial wage has reduced by over ten percentage points from over 27.6% in 1997 to less than 17% in 2005.</P>
        <P>In an international context, the most recent data from OECD relating to the year 2004 indicates that, once again, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge, that is, income tax plus employee and employer PRSI as a proportion of gross wages plus employers PRSI, in the EU and one of the lowest in the entire OECD. Furthermore, the personal average tax rate of the average production worker dropped in Ireland between 2003 and 2004, despite an increase in wages. Meanwhile, the average tax rate rose or remained the same in about 20 of the other 29 countries surveyed.</P><Col N="1808"/>
        <P>For the single worker on the average production wage in Ireland, the average tax rate is the third lowest after Korea and Mexico of the 30 countries studied. It is the lowest of the 19 EU member states surveyed. A married one-earner couple with two children on the average production wage in Ireland in 2004 in fact receives more money in cash transfers from the State than they pay out in income tax and social security contributions. Only Luxembourg is in the same league as Ireland in this respect and the OECD figures do not take account of the further improvements made in budget 2005.</P>

	<P>The 2% stamp duty, levied on non-life insurance premia, is part of the stamp duty system and applies to most categories of non-life insurance business, including motor insurance. It was introduced in the Finance Act 1982 at 1% and was subsequently increased to 2% in 1993. This is a modest levy compared with other EU member states, most of which have such a tax and where it is generally levied at a significantly higher rate than in Ireland, typically between 9% and 15%.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this non-life levy is to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. It is a significant source of revenue to the Exchequer and yielded &euro;97.7 million in 2004 across all relevant categories of insurance. It is not possible to ascertain what portion of this relates to motor insurance premia.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Preliminary data indicate that the volume of exports of goods and services declined by 0.6% year-on-year in the first half of 2005. This follows a relatively solid expansion of 7% in exports in 2004. There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the reasons for the subdued performance to date in 2005. Both goods and services exports have been weak. Industrial production, that is, goods data indicate <Col N="1809"/>that chemicals production in particular has been weak. Balance of payments data indicate that on the services side insurance exports have been weak. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting trends in export performance based on only a few quarters&rsquo; data. Quarterly data is volatile and subject to revision. In addition, changes in production-operations patterns, in particular in multinational sectors, can in the short term result in volatility in export growth. Given the uncertainty surrounding export performance and its drivers in the short term, emerging trends in export performance will be carefully monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>Between Q1 2001 and Q1 2005 the numbers employed in manufacturing declined by 33,300, or 13.2%. However, this decline in employment in the manufacturing sector has taken place over a period when total employment increased by 197,400, or 11.5%. This indicates that some of the decline in manufacturing employment can be seen as part of a process of structural change in the economy. While manufacturing jobs are being lost, many jobs in high value added sectors such as financial services are being created. It is also the case that losses in competitiveness over the last number of years are placing pressure on manufacturing firms. It is for this reason that we must remain focused on restoring and enhancing competitiveness going forward if Ireland is to continue growing strongly.</P>

	<P>Authorised Revenue officers are empowered to make an application to a judge of the High Court seeking an order requiring financial institutions to supply names, addresses and other relevant information concerning account holders who may have held bogus non-resident deposit accounts. Such applications are made under section 908 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended by the Finance Act 1999. Information supplied by the financial institutions under section 908 orders is the principal basis for identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the volun<Col N="1810"/>tary disclosure scheme in 2001. This inquiry work commenced on 16 November 2001.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that 18 applications for orders under section 908 have been made and have been granted. When one includes institutions which have been taken over or amalgamated with other institutions, these orders seek information in respect of accounts in 26 financial institutions. No further applications for such orders are pending in regard to the bogus non-resident account inquiries.</P>
        <P>A large volume of information has been reported to Revenue under the High Court orders. Inquiry work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further general issues of inquiry letters were made in January, May, July, September and October 2003 and January 2004. These general inquiry letter issues relate to 91,000 non-resident accounts that had Irish addresses connected to them. A total of 177,000 inquiry letters have been issued to taxpayers in respect of these non-resident accounts. The final general inquiry letter issue took place in January 2004.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the final phase of this investigation is now substantially complete. Since 15 November 2001 payments of &euro;368 million have been made to Revenue by taxpayers who held bogus non-resident accounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there are two ways in which a taxpayer may have been in breach of the amnesty, first, in making a false declaration or, second, in not making a declaration. I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners do not have figures for the number of detected breaches of the amnesty. Because of the confidentiality conditions built into the 1993 amnesty legislation, such breaches are difficult to identify and prove.</P>
        <P>Individuals and companies have been successfully prosecuted in recent years as a result of Revenue investigations, and although these investigations have in some instances involved consideration of possible amnesty breaches, it has not generally been possible to obtain the evidence necessary to meet the required standards of &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; from an amnesty per<Col N="1811"/>spective. However, one individual has been successfully prosecuted to date for failure to comply with the obligatory provisions of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993, following a Revenue investigation. He was ordered to pay a fine of &euro;125,000 before 17 September or face two years in prison. He was also ordered to pay his outstanding liability of &euro;118,917 within the same three month period.</P>
        <P>Also, as the Deputy will be aware, there was a well-publicised conviction in the Circuit Criminal Court recently for tax offences related to the amnesty where a six months jail sentence was handed down. This followed an investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>Revenue&rsquo;s criminal investigation programmes have been refocused recently with the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division, one of whose functions is to increase the number of prosecutions for serious tax evasion. Many of the cases currently under investigation relate to tax offences committed in recent years and do not therefore involve consideration of amnesty issues. However, a number of cases have been identified which could involve offences in relation to the amnesty and they will be investigated with a view to taking a criminal prosecution.</P>
        <P>In view of this, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are making every effort to ensure the law is applied in the manner intended by the legislation as passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The commission also publishes quarterly performance statements setting out a summary of the fund&rsquo;s performance in the year to date as a means of improving the timeliness of information on the fund. The quarterly statements do not distinguish between Irish and non-Irish investments. The most recent of these statements, for the quarter to end-June 2005, was published on 14 July 2005. It shows that the estimated market value of the fund was &euro;13,294 million at 30 June 2005. Of this amount, &euro;1,404 million was held in cash and other net current assets, including derivatives, &euro;26 million in property, &euro;137 million in commodities, a total of &euro;10,123 million in equities and &euro;1,604 million in bonds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission is required by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 to include in its annual report information on the investment strategy followed by the fund, a report on the investment return achieved and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at year-end. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the Minister and the public.</P><Col N="1813"/>
        <P Just="Left">As the Deputy will be aware, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which controls, manages and invests the fund, is independent of Government. It has discretionary authority to determine and implement the fund&rsquo;s investment strategy. The investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long term, having regard to: the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000; and the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>The Government Supplies Agency, as part of its procurement responsibilities, has placed contracts for several years with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann for the supply of natural gas to a large number of State sites.</P>
        <P>As with all procurement, the agency seeks to achieve the most economically advantageous terms available for its end users. Prior to 2003 this involved negotiating a price for the supply of natural gas with the single supplier, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann. Following deregulation, there was scope for competition in relation to the unit price of gas, and the GSA initiated a process of competitive pricing for the unit cost, which is still in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to transmission costs, the Deputy will be aware that gas has to be transported from either Inch, near Kinsale, or Moffat in Scotland to each site in the country. This transmission or transportation mechanism is operated by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Commission for Energy Regulation, on 29 July 2005, invited observations from the public and interested parties on its proposed decision <Col N="1814"/>regarding transmission or transportation tariffs for the 2005-06 gas year. The Government Supplies Agency, in response to that invitation, submitted its views to the commission on 25 August 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The agency&rsquo;s observations, which related to transmission costs only, were offered as part of an ongoing dialogue on the provision of energy supplies between the agency, acting on behalf of its customers, and the commission. The agency acknowledges and accepts that the commission will take a wider range of considerations into account when reaching its decisions. The agency did not receive any direct feedback on its letter from the commission.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>At end September 2005 voted capital expenditure, including carryover from 2004, was &euro;370 million behind profile as compared with the profile published in January last. I have set out below the factors for the shortfall as compared to profile as advised to my Department by the Departments concerned. In general I would point out to the Deputy that because of its nature it is difficult to precisely predict the pattern of capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>Transport underspend of &euro;100 million as compared with profile: I am advised by the Department of Transport that on roads there is an underspend as compared with profile of &euro;64.5 million. The underspend is due to planning delays which occurred earlier this year and slower than anticipated land acquisitions.</P>
        <P>On public transport, the underspend of &euro;35.1 million to date is mainly due to: slower than anticipated progress on the closeout of Luas contracts including the finalisation of property purchases; slightly lower than anticipated expenditure on public safety transport and development projects; anticipated expenditure on integrated ticketing has been delayed due to an inconclusive procurement process. The RPA has submitted proposals to the Department of Transport for a revised implementation plan, which requires revising the profiled expenditure.</P>
        <P>On the Health Service Executive, the underspend was &euro;64 million. I am advised by the Department of Health and Children that the underspend to date is due in part to the establishment of the HSE and the resulting reorganisation of health structures in 2005 and to some general slippage on the capital programme in the early part of the year, in particular on some major projects.</P><Col N="1815"/>
        <P>The Office of Public Works &mdash; underspend of &euro;44 million as compared with profile. I am advised by the Office of Public Works that expenditure on decentralisation is slower than anticipated.</P>
        <P>Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; underspend of &euro;41 million. I am advised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that capital expenditure was &euro;41 million behind forecast to the end of September. The main factors contributing to the underspend are buoyancy in Enterprise Ireland and IDA&rsquo;s own income and lower than anticipated draw-down of grants by companies.</P>
        <P>Agriculture &mdash; underspend of &euro;30 million. I am advised by the Department of Agriculture and Food that the main reasons for below profile spending are: subhead H, Farm Waste Management. The impact of improved grant rates approved for the farm waste management scheme, FWM, is not expected to take effect until 2006. The take up rate to date has been somewhat slower in the current year than anticipated. Subhead I, Forestry. The rate of planting under the afforestation scheme has been lower than anticipated in the current year. Subhead G, Installation Aid. There was a lower than anticipated number of applications for the installation aid scheme in 2005 to date.</P>
        <P>Communications, Marine and Natural Resources &mdash; underspend of &euro;27 million. I am advised by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that the major components in the shortfall are: delayed procurement process for phase II of MANs broadband programme; and general underspend in a number of other capital programmes due to slower than anticipated progress and to delays arising from later than expected agreement on or submission of payment claims.</P>
        <P>Arts, Sport and Tourism &mdash; underspend of &euro;25 million. I am advised by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism that the underspend arises from delays in the construction timeframes in relation to a number of projects being grant aided.</P>
        <P>Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs &mdash; underspend of &euro;22 million. I am advised by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that the underspend is primarily because of delays in a number of major islands projects. A considerable portion of the Department&rsquo;s Gaeltacht and rural capital programme is delivered through local authorities and claims under these programmes have been slower than expected.</P>

	<P>The National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, No. 29 of 2002, provides for accountability and reporting arrangements for the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, in regard to its functions. Under section 12 of the Act, the board of the agency is charged with ensuring that its functions are performed effectively. Under section 20 of the Act, the agency is subject to audit and examination by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The chief executive officer and the chairperson are required to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts, whenever required, primarily through the examination of the annual report and accounts and any other special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>My Department is examining, in conjunction with the NDFA and the Office of the Attorney General, whether legislative amendments may be required to allocate the new functions to NDFA and related matters.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure maximum impetus to the new initiative, the Government decided that NDFA should commence the new role on an interim non-statutory basis. The NDFA will report directly to me in relation to its procurement functions. The board will be strengthened by the appointment of two additional board members, in due course.</P>
        <P>Ministers sponsoring individual projects will continue to be responsible for all aspects of the assessment and approval of such projects, including the decision to procure the project as a PPP, signing off on project budgets, output specifications and other service requirements. The NDFA will be responsible for procuring the projects within these parameters. The NDFA will be tasked with the management of the procurement delivery stage of the PPP projects and carrying out any negotiations needed. They will hand over the completed project to the Minister-Department concerned after construction.</P>

        <Quest>with regard to the almost &euro;2.5 billion remaining outstanding in uncollected taxes, his views on the proportion of this the Revenue Commissioners expect to recover; if new measures are planned to assist in the collection of outstanding taxes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total tax debt outstanding at 31 March 2005, as reported in Revenue&rsquo;s annual report and in the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, was &euro;1.2 billion, not &euro;2.5 billion as quoted by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>As with any tax system, there will always be people who pay late, people who try to avoid paying and people who cannot pay. In this context it is important to note that the debt of &euro;1,217 million at 31 March 2005 is &euro;146 million or 10.7% less than at 31 March 2004. The figure represents 2.5% of annual gross collection and is one of the lowest percentages of any tax administration internationally. This compares to a total debt of 4% of gross receipts in 1999, 15% in 1994 and 30% in 1989. Of this figure, &euro;278 million of the total debt is under appeal with a further &euro;349 million under control or at enforcement. The remainder, &euro;590 million, is under active collection.</P>
        <P>It is the goal of Revenue, as stated in its Statement of Strategy 2005-2007, that all debt on record should be less than five years old, or the subject of active enforcement or court proceedings. In this context, I am advised by Revenue that it would expect the current collectible tax debt and any additional debt that will arise for periods up to 31 December 2004, through assessments made by Revenue or submission of overdue returns by taxpayers, would ultimately be reduced over the next five years by 96%. That reduction will be achieved primarily by collection of the debt due.</P>
        <P>Revenue has emphasised the changing element of the debt make-up and the difficulty that this creates in making an estimate of the likely reduction in the debt figure over a five-year period. Revenue&rsquo;s strategies and methodologies adopted to achieve a reduction over a five-year period will be subject to annual review and evaluation that is carried out within the context of the business planning process.</P>

        <Quest>if he is committed to keeping those on the national minimum wage out of the tax net; the number of persons on the national minimum wage who have been brought back into the tax net as result of the increase to &euro;7.65 per hour which came into operation from 1 May 2005; if he will take steps to remove these low earners from the tax net; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to having the minimum wage exempt from tax. However, we are also committed to sustaining economic growth <Col N="1818"/>and keeping the public finances in a healthy condition. The question of restoring the position which applied after budget 2005 where those earning the minimum wage were removed from the tax net will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual budgets over the next number of years consistent with the Government&rsquo;s overall economic and budgetary strategy.</P>
        <P>I might remind the Deputy that it was this Government that introduced the minimum wage to protect low paid workers and it was this Government who over the last eight budgets removed a record number of about 465,000 workers from the tax net entirely. In addition, I would point out that we now have one of the highest minimum wages in the European Union. Since its introduction in April 2000, the minimum wage has increased by almost 37% taking account of the latest increase; this is well ahead of inflation.</P>
        <P>The present entry point to income tax is &euro;14,250 per annum for a single person on PAYE aged under 65. The Revenue Commissioners provisionally estimate that there will be roughly 37,000 income earners in an income range which would bring them into the tax net if their annual earnings reflected fully the increase in the national minimum wage. However, this group will of necessity include part-time workers earning more than the minimum hourly wage, and certain pensioners whose earnings are in the equivalent range. The 37,000 should therefore be seen as the upper limit for any estimate of the number who may ultimately come into the tax net on a full year basis as a result of the minimum wage increase.</P>
        <P>The estimates of the numbers removed from the tax net over the last eight budgets and those who may ultimately come into the tax net on a full year basis in 2005 as a result of the minimum wage increase are calculated on a revised post-budget 2005 basis using as a base the most recent data available relating to the tax year 2002.</P>

	<P>The taxation of motor fuel and other oil products is made up of two elements, mineral oil excise and VAT. The amount of mineral oil excise collected is based on the volume of motor fuel sold, in this case the number of litres of petrol, or diesel sold. The revenue collected from mineral oil excise does not fluctuate with price changes. Therefore, assuming there is no change in the volume sold, the increase in tax revenue arising from increases <Col N="1820"/>in the cost of motor fuels will correspond to an increase in VAT revenue.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated additional yield from VAT over and above the budget estimate is as set out below:</P>

        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>As Minister for Finance, I have made it clear that I will put in place whatever measures are necessary when the need to address complicity in tax non-compliance is identified. My first Finance Act, Finance Act 2005, contained provisions to ensure the effectiveness of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to pursue prosecutions not only against persons who engage in tax evasion but also against those who facilitate tax evasion.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>In addition, the Act introduced a new offence of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of tax. It also provides that where an <Col N="1822"/>offence is committed by a body corporate, any director, officer or manager who consented, connived or approved of the commission of the offence or was reckless as to whether an offence was being committed, is also deemed to be guilty of the offence concerned.</P>
        <P>The Finance Act 2005 changes add to the comprehensiveness of the provisions in relation to the relevant Revenue offences. More generally, the new provisions enhance the armoury of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with tax evasion and I am satisfied they address the point being made by the general secretary of congress.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that about 10,000 notices of intention to make a disclosure were received from taxpayers, or agents on their behalf, by the 23 May deadline. In some instances the notices were described as protective, with taxpayers needing to establish whether in fact any liabilities arose. Revenue was not in a position to make any estimate of the numbers in advance of the deadline. Since that date about 5,000 individuals have made payments totalling &euro;367 million. Revenue have been following up on those who, having given notice of an intention to disclose, did not do so and, while final figures are not yet available, it now appears that a substantial number of them will have no additional liability. It is not possible at this stage to give a reliable estimate of the final amount likely to be recovered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 219 and 220 together.</P>
        <P>There is strong co-ordination of measures to deter money laundering in the financial system at EU level. A third money laundering directive has recently been adopted by the Council and the Parliament and is due to come into affect shortly. The directive will require to be transposed into domestic legislation in each member state within 24 months of its coming into effect.</P>
        <P>The third money laundering directive will replace and update the 1991 and 2001 money laundering directives which imposed obligations on financial institutions and, more recently, on lawyers, accountants and auctioneers to identify their clients and report suspicious transactions to the police authorities. The new directive reflects the 2003 revision of the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, the main international anti-money laundering organisation. One of its central features is to strengthen the obligation on financial institutions, and others, to identify the beneficial ownership of legal entities. It will also impose an obligation on financial institutions and others to pay particular attention to &ldquo;politically exposed persons&rdquo;, as defined in the third money laundering directive, from other member states and from third countries. The directive also brings terrorist funding into the money laundering framework and introduces the concept of a risk-based approach to the implementation of its requirements. The directive will require amendment of our domestic legislation in relation to money laundering.</P>
        <P>Ireland also participates in work to ensure that the EU legal frameworks are adapted to the FATF&rsquo;s special recommendations on terrorist <Col N="1824"/>financing. For example, a proposal to tighten controls of money transfers in order to cut off funding sources for terrorists and other criminals has been presented by the European Commission in line with FATF recommendations. The proposed regulation would require that money transfers be accompanied by the identity of the sender. The proposed measures will ensure that this information will be immediately available to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.</P>
        <P>The issues of money laundering and criminality generally are also regularly discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, Council of the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>The publication of the Competition Authority&rsquo;s final report on competition in the non-investment banking sector on 22 September 2005 is welcome. The report focuses on two markets &mdash; personal current accounts and SME lending. It finds that Irish banks do not compete aggressively for existing customers in those markets. The report maps out a series of steps to be taken to build greater competition in the banking industry. It highlights several areas in which financial institutions can through increased competition be more responsive to customer&rsquo;s needs, thereby increasing choice and the quality of services provided.</P>
        <P>The 25 recommendations contained in the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report are directed largely at the industry, its representative bodies, the financial regulator and Central Bank, as well as to the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>In summary, the authority recommends action to make it easier for both personal and SME customers to switch both loan and current account providers. It also identifies a need for improved information on financial products. Finally, the authority recommends actions aimed at creating a more open and flexible payment clearing system.</P><Col N="1825"/>
        <P>Some important actions have already taken place in line with these recommendations. The IBF has adopted a voluntary switching code aimed at streamlining the process of changing banks by personal current account holders. The authority recommends both the extension of this code to cover SME current accounts and that the financial regulator should monitor its operation with a view to implementing a statutory scheme if it proves ineffective. The authority acknowledges that the Irish Payment Services Organisation, IPSO, has acted to remove some barriers to entry to the clearing system, and is engaged in further reforms of its organisational structure.</P>
        <P>Points addressed for the attention of the Minister for Finance include the issues of stamp duty, the regulation of banking charges and the question of improvements in the area of mortgages and cheques.</P>
        <P>Measures have already been taken, through the Finance Act 2005, to eliminate a double stamp duty charge on switching of financial cards. The authority suggests that the existence of the stamp duty may be an inhibitor to competition as it acts as a disincentive to the holding of multiple accounts, and recommends that an analysis to see if this is the case be done. Since the duty is levied without discrimination on issues of financial cards and, in view of the Finance Act 2005 changes, there would not seem to be a persuasive case that the duty, <i>per se</i>, creates any significant competitive distortion. Accordingly, while I am having the report examined, I do not see a <i>prima facie</i> case to incur the costs of performing such a general analysis.</P>
        <P>The authority recommend that regulation of non-interest bank charges should only end once its other recommendations to facilitate and improve market entry and switching have been successfully implemented and are working in practice to improve competition.</P>
        <P>The report acknowledges that any measures aimed at improving competition in the mortgage market needs to take account of relevant EU developments. The question of facilitating the transfer of mortgages raises important legal issues, including in relation to conveyancing and contract law.</P>
        <P>At present paper cheques are returned to issuing banks as part of the clearing cycle. The authority suggests that IPSO should investigate if new technology, allowing banks to exchange electronic images of cheques, known as cheque truncation, would yield efficiency benefits. I support the authority&rsquo;s view that legislation should not be passed unless this investigation establishes a business case for cheque truncation. I am open to proposals for changes to legislation to facilitate improved cheque handling technology, if such is required.</P>
        <P>In addition to the recommendations addressed directly to me, I will be monitoring closely pro<Col N="1826"/>gress in implementing all the recommendations contained in the report and their impact overall to ensure that the legislative and regulatory framework for financial services supports a competitive market environment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to the output gained under the local infrastructure priority of the regional programme. For the period January 2000 to December 2004, some &euro;1.63 billion was spent on this priority under the southern and eastern regional operation programme. This represented some 95% of the original expenditure profile for the priority. Funding under this element of the operational programme provides for a wide range of investment including non-national roads, rural water schemes, waste management facilities, urban and village renewals projects, e-commerce infrastructure, seaports, safety projects at regional airports, habitat preservation and heritage conservation.</P>
        <P>The most recent data on the operational programme available to my Department relates to the period January 2000 to December 2004. This suggests that outputs are consistent with targets and the level of expenditure incurred. This is particularly evident with respect to investment in the non-national roads, rural water and urban and village renewal measures. Progress reports for the period to the end of June 2005 will be presented to the next meeting of the monitoring committee at the end of this month.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 152 together.</P>
        <P>The responsibility of my Department is to ensure that resources are made available to meet the Government&rsquo;s priorities and to secure full drawdown of Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of structural funds. To date, the level of Exchequer resources made available under the NDP has been greater than originally profiled.</P>
        <P>Significant progress continues to be made in the implementation of the national development plan in the Border, midland and west region. The most recent monitoring data reported to my Department indicates that overall some &euro;9.6 billion has been expended under the plan over the period January 2000 to December 2004. In 2004 alone, more than &euro;1 billion was spent on the key economic and social infrastructure programme in the BMW region. This represented 96% of projected expenditure for the year 2004 with total expenditure at nearly 90% of projected levels for the period January 2000 to December 2004. In the national roads programme &euro;168 million more was spent in the BMW region in 2004 than in all of 2003. In the housing programme, expenditure in the BMW region from January 2000 to December 2004 reached 120% of projected expenditure for the period. Expenditure on the health programme over the same period amounted to 99% of forecast.</P>
        <P>While performance of the productive sector operational programme remains behind the original targets set in 1999 in both the BMW and southern and eastern regions, performance of both regional operational programmes remains strong in relation to public sector investment in local infrastructure, micro-enterprise support and social inclusion but weaker on schemes dependent on private sector demand, particularly in the agricultural sector. Expenditure on the employ<Col N="1829"/>ment and human resource development operational programme is broadly consistent with targets in both regions with expenditure of nearly &euro;3 billion or 94% of the original expenditure targets being incurred in the BMW region for the period 2000 to 2004.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that expenditure under the EU funded elements of the operational programmes will continue until the end of 2008. Therefore, expenditure which will occur in the years 2007 and 2008 must be considered when viewing the rate of progress on the measures supported by the structural funds. To ensure full utilisation of structural funds and matching public resources, expenditure levels should exceed 50% at the end of 2004 the mid-way point in the programming period. At the end of 2004 estimated expenditure of the structural funds and matching public resources amounted to &euro;1.4 billion or 72% of profile. This is above the mid-way target and should ensure that all structural funds for the programming period 2000-06 are fully expended.</P>
        <P>The BMW region is categorised as an Objective 1 region for the full programming period 2000-2006. Due to the growth of the region&rsquo;s economy relative to the EU average, the region will qualify for structural funds under the proposed regional competitiveness and employment objective or Objective 2 for the period 2007-13. The transitional arrangements proposed for natural growth regions, such as the BMW, are not yet finalised at this stage due to uncertainty over the EU&rsquo;s financial perspective for the 2007-13 period and the ongoing negotiation of the structural funds&rsquo; regulatory framework for the future planning period.</P>

However, a further increase could have an impact on some of these variables in the future.</P>

There are Ansbacher type arrangements and there are other cases involving offshore funds and deposits.</P>
        <P>Revenue has advised that the review team has inquired into 289 cases to date and 147 of these cases have been finalised.

The 289 cases are made up of 179 cases listed on the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report and 110 similar cases discovered by Revenue or listed on the authorised officer&rsquo;s report. A total of 211 cases have been under active investigation. The remaining cases consist of 62 non-resident persons, including 17 former Irish residents, 12 individuals who claimed the 1993 amnesty provisions and four cases with insufficient identity information.</P>

In addition, Revenue made a further application to the High Court for access to the supporting papers to the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report. The High Court order in the matter was granted in June 2004 and perfected in January 2005 and allows for access to documents relating to clients of Ansbacher named in the High Court inspectors&rsquo; report and those persons and companies, including members of the board, found by the High Court inspectors to have failed to co-operate with their inquiry. The order also allows for Revenue to make application and grounding affidavit for the obtaining of information and documents relating to any other individual or company.

	<P>The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002. The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007 at the end of the five year period. A total of 1.17 million accounts were opened during the period outlined.</P>
        <P>The specific goal of the SSIA scheme was to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years. Its effect has been to stimulate such savings over varying income ranges which is evident in the extensive take-up by many low income earners. The scheme has been a success in those terms. The scheme has a specific duration. Any proposals for new savings schemes to replace the SSIA scheme would be considered as part of the normal annual budgetary process taking account of public policy objectives and Exchequer cost implications.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are conducting their investigation into the use by taxpayers of life assurance investment products for the purposes of tax evasion in two stages. In the first stage of these inquiries taxpayers, who invested undisclosed and undeclared funds in life assurance products were given until 23 May 2005 to advise Revenue about their problem. This part of the disclosure stage has now been successfully completed and about 10,000 notices of intention to make a disclosure were received from taxpayers of their agents. Some of these notices were protective. Correspondence was received from others indicating that no liabilities arose.</P>
        <P>Revenue formally commenced the second stage of its investigation into the use of life assurance products for tax evasion on 23 May 2005. As part of this process Revenue has already contacted and met with representatives of a number of life assurance companies. Revenue will shortly be contacting other life assurance companies. New powers given in the Finance Act 2005 authorise Revenue officers to examine the records that relate to a class or classes of life assurance policies and policyholders in the course of conducting sampling exercises. Insurance companies have already been contacted in this regard and the powers are now being used. This work will assist Revenue in furthering their investigation through applications to the High Court for information in respect of relevant policyholders.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I attended the informal ECOFIN Council meeting in Manchester on 9 and 10 September. This meeting was attended by ministers for finance and governors of central banks of all 25 EU member states and of Bulgaria and Romania. As you will be aware, no formal decisions are adopted at informal ECOFIN Council meetings but a useful and informative exchange of views took place on a number of issues, including the following: On responding to the challenges of globalisation, the meeting emphasised the need for trade openness, globally and between the EU and its major trade and investment partners, and the need for constant up-skilling of the labour force through investment in education and training in order to be able to exploit new areas of comparative advantage. On development financing &mdash; the EU statement for the UN high level meeting on financing for development of 14 September was agreed. On implementation of stability and growth pact &mdash; Ministers reached political agreement on the existence of an excessive budget deficit in Portugal. In accordance with the new provisions of the pact, and in light of relevant factors, including the cyclical slowdown and the size of the adjustment required, Portugal was to be allowed six months to present corrective action and until 2008 at the latest to bring its excessive deficit to an end. On the current economic situation and financial stability, the EU Presidency statement for the international monetary and financial committee of the IMF was agreed and a statement on rising oil prices was also made. Ireland agreed with the consensus that oil prices are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future and that short term policy responses should avoid being distortionary and should not have the effect of postponing the necessary adjustment by economic agents to the new higher oil price environment; On the West Bank and Gaza, Ministers agreed on the importance of supporting economic regeneration in the West Bank and Gaza Strip at this historic time. They welcomed options for increased EU support for infrastructure and the private sector, delivered jointly by the Commission and the European Investment Bank through technical assistance and appropriate financial resources. On counter-terrorist financing, Ministers repeated their commitment to international standards to tackle terrorist finance and money-laundering, implement these standards themselves in Europe and help other countries do so. A key element of this <Col N="1835"/>approach must be international technical assistance to countries. Ministers agreed that they would work together to emphasise at the IMF and the World Bank meetings later in September that international technical assistance must be co-ordinated, high quality and effective. Overall the meeting succeeded in making good progress on important issues as outlined in this reply.</P>

        <Quest>the anticipated costs, in terms of acquiring and equipping premises and other related costs at the latest date for which figures are available of the original decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004 and the slimmed down version announced in December 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[26634/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to the full implementation of the decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004, involving some 10,300 civil and public service jobs in more than 56 locations. My office is in the process of procuring appropriate properties in the designated locations for the Departments and agencies involved, with much progress having been made over the past year. Property acquisition negotiations are completed or are significantly advanced at 23 locations.</P>
        <P>The prevailing property market conditions in each geographical area have a significant bearing on the cost of acquiring sites. As the acquisition process is still in progress, it is not possible at this stage to provide a precise estimate of the cost of the site acquisition programme. However, for working purposes only, an indicative figure of &euro;75 to &euro;100 million is being used by the OPW.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will know, the decentralisation implementation group, DIG, in its report of November 2004 announced the names of the Departments and organisations selected as &lsquo;early movers&rsquo; and set out a timetable for provision of accommodation. At the same time the group published a report on the procurement and financial aspects of decentralisation. A further report in June 2005 updates the timetable announced in November 2004, includes a timetable for the balance of organisations comprehended by the decentralisation programme, and sets out commencement and completion dates for accommodation ranging from the final quarter of 2005 to end of 2009. I am confident that this programme will be successfully implemented.</P>
        <P>In regard to the public private partnership approach recommended by the DIG, my office has been developing a comprehensive risk-adjusted costing of project elements to measure the value-for-money of future PPP bids. <Col N="1836"/>Although property solutions will include leasing and fitting-out of existing buildings, it is anticipated that, in the majority of cases, the accommodation facilities will be provided by the construction of new office buildings and cost estimation can be approached on that basis. However, in advance of actual market testing of any procurement methodology, it is possible, at this time, only to assign the most general measurements of cost to such a large-scale, diverse and complex programme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is estimated that approximately 210,000 square metre of office space will be required to accommodate the total numbers included in the programme. Current OPW cost norms in respect of offices would indicate an average build-cost to fit-out standard, in the range of &euro;1,800 per square metre to &euro;2,200 per square metre. Such figures exclude VAT, professional fees and inflation. In addition, the cost of equipping the accommodation to standard office equipment levels could be estimated at c. &euro;4,000 per person. This would exclude the cost of information and communication technology and specialised equipment requirements. Such general measurements of cost do not include specialised facility and equipment requirements and other variables which would arise from the spread of possible procurement methodologies. In addition, general cost indicators of this type show a snapshot in time.</P>
        <P>It is self-evident that a firmer scale of costs for the decentralisation programme will only emerge on foot of actual cost proposals being received from the market. It will be some months yet before sufficient data can be extracted from a suitable range of tender competitions to provide a basis on which more robust estimates of the overall cost of the programme can be made. Nevertheless, it can be estimated that, generally-speaking, the cost of providing accommodation in provincial, compared to central Dublin locations should yield considerable cost savings to the State over time in terms of site costs, capital build costs and indeed maintenance costs.</P>

	<P>I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the impact of higher diesel prices on freight costs for Irish producers.</P>
        <P>Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors, including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs. The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflected additional factors such as geo<Col N="1837"/>political uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in &ldquo;catch-up&rdquo; countries such as China. However, mineral oil taxes are a factor influencing fuel prices. In this regard, proposals submitted to me, from those most affected by the rising costs, which seek changes in the taxation on fuel, will be considered in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>There are currently four EU directives for which my Department has responsibility which have to be implemented before their relevant deadlines. In addition, there are a further three EU directives which, despite being fully implemented by Ireland, still appear on the EU Commission&rsquo;s list of outstanding directives. The Commission has been informed of this position. We await notification from the Commission that it has removed these three directives from its list of outstanding directives.</P>
        <P>The details of each of the four directives still to be implemented are set out as follows: 1. Council Directive 2005/19/EC amending Directive 90/434/EEC 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchange of shares concerning companies of different member states. This directive amends the 1990 mergers directive which provides tax neutrality for cross-border company restructuring. The amending directive extends tax deferral to a larger number of cases and improves the methods to secure tax neutrality while safeguarding the financial interests of member states. The deadline for implementation is 1 January 2006; 2. Council Directive 2004/18/EC: Revised Public Sector Procurement Directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006; 3. Council Directive 2004/17/EC: Revised Utilities Sector Procurement Directive. This directive co-ordinates the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sector. The deadline for implementation is 30 January 2006; 4. Council Directive 2004/39/EC Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MIFID. This directive allows investment firms to provide their services across the EU on the basis of their home country authorisation, that is, it will give them an effective &ldquo;single passport&rdquo;. The deadline for implemen<Col N="1838"/>tation is 30 April 2006. However, in view of the complexity of the directive and the changes in IT and other administrative procedures which the financial services sector will have to make, the Commission has proposed that the date for implementation be extended by six months. This would extend the deadline to the end of October 2006, with a further six months for industry to comply. This proposed extension is likely to be approved by Council.</P>
        <P>Every effort is made by my Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to ensure that directives are implemented within their deadlines and this is expected to be achieved in regard to the four directives listed above.</P>

Of these 4,813 were from civil and public servants, 4,236 civil servants and 577 public servants, currently located in Dublin. New applications for decentralisation continue to be received.

	<P>From the outset both the Government and I have made it clear that participation in the decentralisation programme is voluntary. Because of the nature of the programme it is not possible at this stage to estimate the number of public servants who do not wish to relocate as individual circumstances are open to change and therefore figures can fluctuate. The picture will become clearer over the coming period as staff is assigned to decentralising organisations. Those public and civil servants who do not wish to relocate outside Dublin will be offered alternative posts in Dublin. Regular consultations are of course taking place with unions representing civil and public servants. These consultations are seeking to address the full range of issues concerning civil and public servants wishing to relocate and those who want to remain in Dublin.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150, 212 and 213 together.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility for the procurement, management and implementation of capital projects rests with individual Departments and public bodies under their aegis subject to compliance with general conditions of sanction and accountability. It is important to ensure a much closer alignment between the agreed tender price and the final outturn cost to minimise the potential for cost overruns. To help achieve this, my Department has put in place an integrated set of actions to address the issues of better management and implementation of capital programmes and projects. These include the five-year rolling multiannual capital envelopes framework, guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expenditure and a programme of reform of construction procurement.</P>
        <P>With regard to construction procurement reform, the Government decided in 2004 to introduce new arrangements to help reduce the scale of and scope for cost overruns in capital projects. My Department, with the assistance of the Government contracts committee for construction, has developed a suite of new draft standard forms of contract and conditions of engagement for construction related services, which introduce fixed price lump sum contracts tendered on a competitive basis with appropriate risk transfer. These are subject to consultation with the construction industry and professional bodies with a view to having them in place early next year. These initiatives should enhance the management of capital programmes and help to improve the cost effective delivery of construction projects over the medium to longer term.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, <Col N="1842"/>based on the analysis of the 2004 SSIA annual returns furnished by all qualifying savings managers, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2004 was 1,094,294 and the average monthly subscription at that date was &euro;175. As indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, it is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables including where participants voluntarily withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions over the remaining period of the scheme. For this reason also, it is not possible to state the amount expected to be paid by the Exchequer in each of the 12 months after the SSIAs begin to mature in May 2006. The cost of the scheme in 2004 was &euro;548 million. If the current average monthly subscriptions for the first eight months of 2005 continued for the full year, the annual cost in 2005 will be approximately &euro;587 million. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme is reduced by the exit tax to be returned when the accounts mature. The first SSIA accounts are due to mature at the end of May 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As previously advised to the Deputy in replies to parliamentary questions on 30 November 2004, 28 June 2005 and 28 September 2005, capital gains tax is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order. It was announced in the 2003 budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement. The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Such reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. In budget 1998, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital <Col N="1843"/>gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought CGT into line with other areas.</P>
        <P>In budget 2005, I announced a special stamp duty relief relating to an exchange of farm land between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer&rsquo;s holding. The relief is contained in section 121 of the Finance Act 2005, which provides that no stamp duty will be charged on an exchange of such lands where the lands are of equal value. In a case where the lands exchanged are not of equal value, stamp duty will only be charged on the amount of the difference in the value of the lands concerned. Guidelines on the application of this relief are available from the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

	<P>Significant progress has been achieved in the implementation of the health service reform programme since it was announced by the Government in June 2003. The Health Service Executive was established on a statutory basis with effect from 1 January 2005 <Col N="1847"/>under the Health Act 2004. The executive took over responsibility for the management and delivery of health services from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards and a number of other specified agencies. On 6 March 2005 I approved the national service plan submitted by the HSE under the 2004 Act. A copy of the plan was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 6 April and it has been published on the Internet by the executive. The executive submitted its corporate plan for 2005 to 2007 to me and it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the Act.</P>
        <P>In February 2005, a framework document on corporate and financial governance issued to the Health Service Executive. The executive is drafting its own code of governance in keeping with the framework and its code will require ministerial approval. The code is expected to map internal governance arrangements to ensure adequate accountability and stewardship. When the code is approved the executive is required by the Act to arrange for its publication. The framework document is being adapted with a view to issuing it to health sector agencies funded directly by my Department in the light of their statutory status and requirements. The board of the interim health information and quality authority was appointed in March 2005 and is tasked with making the necessary organisational preparations for the establishment of the authority on a full statutory basis. My Department is preparing draft heads of Bill for the establishment of the health information and quality authority and the social services inspectorate.</P>
        <P>My Department is drafting regulations providing for the establishment of not more than four regional health forums following consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is intended to have them made as soon as possible after the completion of the consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Draft regulations regarding dealings between the Health Service Executive and Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are being finalised. It is my intention to lay these regulations before the Oireachtas in the near future.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing on the research and consultation necessary to inform the drafting of regulations governing the introduction of a statutory framework for dealing with complaints received by the executive. A consultation process on the handling of complaints made to the HSE has been held and a report on its findings is due to be submitted to my Department shortly to inform the making of regulations. An order providing for the convening of the national health consultative forum is under preparation in my Department.</P>

The funding has also provided for the appointment of an additional 245 cancer care nurse specialist across the regions. An evaluation of the first national cancer strategy demonstrated that the key goal of the strategy, to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 age group, was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.</P>
        <P>BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the eastern, north eastern and midland regions of the country. The expansion of the programme to the south east has commenced and screening services are available in Counties Wexford and Carlow. The roll-out of the programme to the remaining regions in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services. A design team has been appointed to work up detailed plans for the construction of two new BreastCheck clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital Cork and the other at University College Hospital Galway. Approximately &euro;21million capital funding has been made available and my Department is in discussions with BreastCheck regarding the revenue requirements for the programme. There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions and BreastCheck is confident that the target date of April 2007 for the commencement of the roll-out will be met.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the roll-out of the national cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. Following the publication of the international expert&rsquo;s report on the feasibility and implications of a national roll out, my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. My Department will now discuss options for a national roll-out of the programme with the Health Service Executive.</P><Col N="1849"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. Recent developments in Cork and Galway have resulted in the provision of an additional five<?oasys _jy?>linear accelerators and the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Last July I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. The Government considers that the best option in terms of improving geographic access for patients in the north western area is to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North-South co-operation on cancer. I have met the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, to discuss access by patients mainly in the north-west to radiation oncology services at Belfast City Hospital. I will meet him again shortly to further progress the Government&rsquo;s position on radiation oncology. Officials of my Department will also meet officials of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland shortly. The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland in line with best international standards. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care to cancer patients. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in oncology services in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The national cancer forum is finalising a new national cancer strategy. The strategy has been developed in consultation with major stakeholders including professional and voluntary groups and the public and will have regard to the multifaceted aspects of cancer control. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations in relation to a balanced organisation of cancer services nationally, with defined roles for hospitals in the delivery of cancer care. It is anticipated that this work will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.</P>
        <P>Following the recent clarification issued by the Labour Relations Commission, there is full agreement between the parties and this will mean the Health Service Executive can proceed with the introduction of general practitioner visit cards to 200,000 people who will have free access to general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme. Applications for assessments on eligibility for visit cards are being processed by the HSE. The income assessment guidelines used by the HSE in considering applications for medical cards were increased by 7.5% with effect from 1 January 2005. Significant changes were also announced in the area of allowances to applicants in respect of dependants and reasonable expenses incurred relating to mortgage, child care and commuting to work. It was anticipated that these increases would result in a net additional 30,000 medical cards. To date, the net number of additional cards issued has not significantly exceeded the figure for the end of 2004. My Department and the HSE are reviewing the operation of the income assessment guidelines with a view to identifying what further changes may be required to enable the desired number of additional medical cards to be issued.</P>

	<P>As I have previously indicated to the House, I consider that appropriate transport arrangements for patients requiring radiotherapy should be made available, where necessary, by the Health Service Executive. My Department raised this matter with the HSE last May to ensure that appropriate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel to obtain radiotherapy. Transport solutions are already a feature of the provision of radiation oncology services.</P>
        <P>Last July I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. Appropriate transport arrangements will form part of the planning and implementation of this plan, given the significant increase in capacity involved.</P>
        <P>The national radiation oncology coordinating group, NROCG, provides advice to my Department and the HSE on radiotherapy. In light of the above and the fact that under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the NROCG does not intend to prepare a specific report on transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Drugs Strategy 2001-08 includes 36 actions which fall under the treatment, rehabilitation and risk reduction pillar. The delivery of services under this pillar involves a complex network of statutory and non-statutory agencies working in partnership. The principal agencies involved are the Department of Health and Children; the Health Service Executive, HSE; the Prison Service; F&Aacute;S; the probation and welfare service; local authorities; the local drug task forces; and a wide range of community and voluntary bodies.</P>
        <P>To address the problem of drug misuse, the HSE provides a wide range of drug addiction services including outreach, education, treatment, rehabilitation and community welfare in line with the actions set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08. Furthermore, the HSE funds and co-ordinates a broad range of services provided by voluntary and community sector organisations. Additional annual funding provided to the HSE for drug treatment services since 1997 amounts to over &euro;55 million. This funding has allowed for the employment of more than 730 staff in the drug addiction services and for the expansion of services including rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, NDS, has acknowledged the significant progress being made across the 36 actions under the treatment pillar of the strategy. It also recognises the importance of the development of a more comprehensive and interlinked approach to rehabilitation under the NDS. Given the overall importance of rehabilitation for drug misusers in terms of &ldquo;moving on&rdquo; and ultimately, reintegrating them into society, it has recommended a fifth pillar of the strategy be established to develop an integrated rehabilitation provision and develop actions to be implemented.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A working group to oversee development of the policy in this area has been established, chaired by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Membership of the working group comprises representatives of all the key stakeholders. The working group will report to the interdepartmental group on drugs and the Cabinet committee on social inclusion with the appropriate actions to be implemented. I am <Col N="1858"/>advised that the HSE is reviewing its existing rehabilitation services so that there is the greatest amount of synergy between both these processes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">On 1 September 2004, following an examination of the work of all inquiries by the Attorney General, the Government decided that the post mortem inquiry should furnish its final report not later than 31 March 2005 and that the inquiry would then cease to exist. The chairman of the inquiry, Ms Anne Dunne, SC, was so advised and requested to furnish her report to me on or before that date.</P>
        <P>She submitted her report on the due date. However, having examined the content of the report, the Attorney General advised me in April that it could not be published, for a number of legal reasons. The Government subsequently approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden, a distinguished expert on medical law and ethics, on 3 May 2005 to provide me with a report on post mortem policy and practice by 21 December 2005.</P>
        <P>Following her appointment and prior to finalisation of her terms of reference, Dr. Madden met various groups including Parents for Justice. She also spoke to key persons in Northern Ireland and the UK who were involved in similar inquiries. In view of the tight timeframe for her work and in order to deliver a comprehensive report by the December deadline, it was decided to concentrate on children born alive and under 12 years of age. Her terms of reference also include inquiring into allegations that pituitary glands were removed from children undergoing post mortem examination for sale to pharmaceutical companies within and outside the State.</P>
        <P>Dr. Madden will inquire into, examine and review various aspects of post mortem practice and organ retention and will report on her find<Col N="1860"/>ings and observations on each matter. She will also make recommendations on policy and legislative changes which she considers necessary. I am hopeful that Dr. Madden&rsquo;s analysis of the material available and her contact with relevant agencies will result in a comprehensive report that will help to put closure on the matter for the many families and next of kin affected by post mortem practice and organ retention.</P>

	<P>Following representations from CAP trade interests Revenue introduced an electronic system in July 2004 enabling them to submit their export declarations and refund claims on-line.</P>
        <P>The development of this facility was consistent with the commitment given in the Revenue Statement of Strategy 2003-05 to increase the options available to do business on-line thereby providing a faster and more efficient service. The new system has been well received by the trade. The take up is expected to rise steadily in the next year. The system, referred to as CAP DTI, was developed in close co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Food and allows Revenue to transmit the refund claims of each <Col N="1862"/>exporter electronically to the Department of Agriculture and Food through REACH.</P>
        <P>The new system will facilitate the implementation of impending mandatory EU regulations, in particular a new format to the single administrative document, SAD. This enhancement is scheduled for completion in late 2006 in conjunction with Revenue&rsquo;s redesigned automatic entry processing, AEP, system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they can only allow tax credits or reliefs on the basis of the information that is known to them. If the information on the tax credit certificate is incorrect or if there is a change in circumstances in the middle of the tax year then taxpayers are encouraged to notify Revenue and relief is given immediately through the PAYE system.</P>
        <P>Where possible, reliefs are given automatically, for example through the tax relief at source system, which is in place for mortgage relief and medical insurance relief, and by automatically carrying forward certain recurring credits from one year to another.</P>
        <P>Some reliefs, for example health expenses, will normally be claimed at the end of the tax year by lodging the appropriate claim form. For the year 2004, some 350,000 reviews were sought by PAYE taxpayers which resulted in refunds.</P>
        <P>While it is true that not everybody claims their full entitlements, the vast majority of taxpayers are conscious of the credits and reliefs they are entitled to and, where claims are necessary, take the required action.</P>
        <P>Revenue makes great efforts to inform PAYE taxpayers of their entitlements through: explanatory material included with the annual issue of tax credit certificates; a wide range of information leaflets and guides; a nationwide network of walk-in information offices; regional lo-call telephone helplines dedicated to PAYE taxpayers; and targeted advertising and publicity campaigns where warranted.</P>
        <P>Revenue has also expanded its contact channels for PAYE taxpayers beyond just the telephone, walk-in offices and correspondence. It is already possible to claim certain credits and allowances through their website and by text messaging, and from early next year it will be possible for PAYE taxpayers to request reviews and claim rebates and most allowances and credits directly over the Internet. The telephone system is also being upgraded to allow a wider range of PAYE <Col N="1863"/>reliefs and credits to be claimed automatically over the phone using simple PIN-based security.</P>

	<P>It would appear that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to stamp duty and I am informed by the Revenue <Col N="1864"/>Commissioners that there is an exemption from stamp duty in the case of the transfer of land to a person who is under the age of 35 years, who is the holder of specified educational qualifications together with the completion of a 180 hours Teagasc approved training programme where required and who complies with certain other conditions.

	<P>As part of the decentralisation programme it is intended that 250 posts of the Revenue Commissioners will be decentralised to Athy, County Kildare. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the timing of the movement of staff to Athy is dependent on suitable accommodation being available. The Office of Public Works is currently examining a number of proposals in relation to a suitable site in Athy. The data from the central applications facility, CAF, published in September 2004 showed that a total of 86 applicants within Revenue and 48 applicants from other Departments have applied to decentralise with the Revenue Commissioners to Athy. There were also three applications from the wider public service.</P>

        <P>The director general of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has sole responsibility for and is independent in deciding the statistical methodology and professional standards to be used in compiling the consumer price index, CPI. The CPI is designed to measure the change in the average level of the prices paid by consumers for goods and services. It measures in index form the monthly changes in the cost of purchasing a representative basket of consumer goods and services.</P>
        <P>Maintaining a moderate rate of inflation remains a key priority of economic policy because of its importance in restoring competitiveness. I made no changes to indirect taxes in the budget and this will help to keep inflation low in 2005.</P>

There is significant interest in the programme and to date there have been 10,500 applications. As the Deputy knows responsibility for implementation within each Department lies with the relevant Ministers and I know my Cabinet colleagues are fully committed to the programme. The decentralisation implementation group set out a timetable for implementation of the Civil Service elements of the programme in its most recent report to me in June. The report can be found at <i>www.decentralisation.gov.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The Decentralisation Implementation Group was appointed to drive forward the overall implementation of the decentralisation programme. The two reports of the implementation group dated 31 March 2004 and 30 July 2004 provided detailed recommendations in implementing the programme. In addition, the implementation group prepared two further reports in November 2004 and one in June 2005 which were approved by the Government and subsequently published. The November report identified the organisations and locations which, in the implementation group&rsquo;s view, should be the first to relocate. This included details of the indicative construction completion dates in respect of office accommodation for the early mover organisations. The June 2005 report described the progress which has been made to date. It reviewed and updated the implementation plan in the light of the developments and dealt with the sequencing of further moves.</P>
        <P>The OPW has to date agreed property solutions for most of the early mover locations. Sites for the remaining locations in the programme are being pursued by the OPW. The Public Appointments Service has provided Departments with the details of those civil and public servants who have applied to relocate with them. Departments are now arranging for the transfer of staff into each organisation for training purposes.</P><Col N="1867"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?><P>The table below shows the destination counties for applicant&rsquo;s first preferences for decentralisation. It should be noted that this table represents a snapshot of applications at a particular date. The position may change over time as applicants may opt to alter their first preference as the process evolves and as timeframes for relocating to particular towns are finalised. The Deputy may also wish to note that a small number of advance parties have relocated this year to Sligo, Portlaoise, Thurles, Tipperary town and Na Furbacha.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>Irish legislation on money laundering is set out in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, as amended. Primary responsibility for legislation in the area of money laundering rests with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Enforcement of the legislation is primarily a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In regard to regulation of the financial sector the role of the Minister for Finance is to bring forward legislative proposals under which the financial regulator can adequately supervise and regulate financial service firms including their compliance with their obligations under the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The financial regulator is independent in the exercise of its powers.</P>
        <P>The financial regulator requires all institutions which it supervises, including international banking and financial services firms located in Ireland, to comply with the anti-money laundering legislation and relevant sectoral guidance notes and to have in place, the necessary procedures and controls to ensure such compliance. The adequacy of such systems is reviewed by the financial regulator in the course of its ongoing supervision of institutions and requirements for improvement advised to institutions as necessary. Furthermore, in accordance with its legal obligation under section 57(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, the financial regulator is obliged to make reports to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners where in the course of its supervision it suspects that an institution has breached the relevant money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that a third money laundering directive has recently been adopted within the EU. This will increase existing anti-money laundering requirements, particularly by obliging affected bodies to identify the beneficial ownership of clients. This new directive will require amendments to our money laundering legislation.</P>

        <Quest>the progress to date with regard to implementation of the recommendations of the interdepartmental group which has reviewed the disabled drivers disabled passengers tax concession 1994 regulations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="1869"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>A special interdepartmental review group carried out a review of the operation of the disabled drivers scheme. The terms of reference of the group were to examine the operation of the existing scheme, including the difficulties experienced by the various groups and individuals involved with it, both on an administrative and user level, and to consider the feasibility of alternative schemes, with a view to assisting the Minister for Finance in determining the future direction of the scheme. The group&rsquo;s report, published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004, sets out in detail the genesis and development of the scheme. It examines the current benefits, the qualifying medical criteria, the Exchequer costs, relationship with other schemes and similar schemes in other countries. The report also makes a number of recommendations, both immediate and long-term, encompassing the operation of the appeals process and options for the future development of the scheme.</P>
        <P>Following on from the report&rsquo;s immediate recommendations concerning the appeals process, amendments to the regulations governing the scheme were made by my predecessor in July 2004, and by me in April 2005, to improve the operation of the appeals process. Those amendments included providing for an expansion of the panel of medical practitioners serving on the Medical Board of Appeal from three to ten. Last month, I once again made regulations in this area, removing entirely the limit on the number of doctors on the appeal board and I hope to make further appointments to the board on the nomination of the Minister for Health and Children in the near future, on foot of this development.</P>
        <P>In respect of the long-term recommendations, I should say that given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government decided in June 2004 that the Minister for Finance would consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>
        <P>This Government is committed to supporting and reinforcing equal participation in society by people with disabilities. I would remind the Deputy that disability was one of the priority areas where I substantially increased investment in budget 2005. Any changes to this scheme will be considered in the context of the overall development of policy in this area.</P>

I have no plans to introduce any further tax incentive schemes of this nature in advance of the completion of this review. Any future schemes of this nature would also have to take account of the EU&rsquo;s regional aid guidelines for the period 2007 to 2013, which are not yet finalised.</P>

        <P>The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide, on a phased basis in association with the local and regional authorities. Phase one of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country which were built on time and under budget. This programme has been extended to a further 90 towns in various locations nationwide. Design and procurement has already commenced in several regions and construction is due to start early in 2006. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007.</P>

The availability of any local authority funding for marina opportunities would be a matter for Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>While I am advised that applications have been made for funding for marina projects in County Donegal under the port infrastructure and marine safety measure of the INTERREG IIIA Ireland-Northern Ireland programme, the Department acts only as implementing agent in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Northern Ireland. Evaluation procedures advised by the special EU programmes body are in accordance with the INTERREG IIIA operational programme whereby projects applying for funding under the port infrastructure and marine safety measure of the INTERREG programme under which marina developments may apply are subject to scrutiny in relation to displacement in terms of the extent to which the project would affect similar activities-projects either positively or negatively. The amount of funds available under the INTERREG IIIA measures is a matter of public record.</P>

	<P>The subject matter of the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers is the continuing house arrest in Burma of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The Government has consistently highlighted the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and condemned the lack of progress towards democracy. The continuing house arrest <Col N="1873"/>of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, other opposition activists and a number of MPs elected in 1990 remains of grave concern to Ireland and our EU partners.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, representing Ireland at the opening session of the Asia-Europe meeting, ASEM, of Foreign Ministers meeting on 6 May 2005 in Kyoto, Japan, expressed Ireland&rsquo;s grave disappointment and concern that the Burmese authorities had failed to create the conditions for political parties to participate in the national convention now in recess. He also urged the Burmese authorities to release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. European and Asian Foreign Ministers participating in the meeting collectively expressed to the Burmese Foreign Minister their concern at the situation in Burma and expressed the hope that all restrictions on the democratisation process would be lifted at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
        <P>On 7 May 2005, the EU Troika of Foreign Ministers met the Burmese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. U Nyan Win, in the margins of the ASEM meeting and expressed similar concerns about the situation in Burma. The EU Troika called on the Burmese authorities to enter into a constructive dialogue with the opposition National League for Democracy, NLD, other legitimate representative bodies and ethnic groups. The EU Troika also called for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners. The Troika further appealed to the Burmese authorities to establish permanent and sincere co-operation with the UN Secretary-General&rsquo;s Special envoy on Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burma, Mr. Sergio Pinheiro, and all relevant UN agencies. The Burmese Foreign Minister undertook to consider the demands expressed by the EU but I regret that in the period since then there has been no progress.</P>
        <P>In my statement on behalf of Ireland at the 60th session of the UN General Assembly on 19 September, I referred to the continuing denial of human rights and democracy in Burma. I stated that this was most acutely symbolised by the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and that her ordeal was not forgotten by the people of Ireland. I pointed out that the cumulative length of her detention is now very close to ten years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s continuing goal, and that of the EU, remains the release and restoration of liberty to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and others under house arrest, return of democracy to Burma, an end to human rights violations there and the realisation of peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.</P>

	<P>The Government takes concerns about the human rights situation in Tibet, and elsewhere in China, very seriously. Human rights issues are a constant point of discussion in our bilateral, and European Union level, dialogue with the Chinese authorities. Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China in 1979 and has from that time recognised Tibet as an integral part of China.</P>
        <P>Tibet regularly features in our discussions within the EU, at EU-China meetings and in our bilateral meetings. The EU-China human rights dialogue, established in 1996, is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns about individual human rights cases and more general issues, such as the protection of freedom of religion, which is particularly important for the people of Tibet. These issues were raised by the EU side at the EU-China summit held in Beijing on 5 September 2005 and the EU&rsquo;s wish to highlight freedom of religion issues during the upcoming EU-China human rights dialogue was expressed. The cases of a number of Tibetan individuals have been included in the list of human rights cases to be discussed with the Chinese authorities during the dialogue, which will be held in Beijing from 24 October 2005.</P>
        <P>During his visit to China in January 2005, the Taoiseach discussed a wide range of issues, including human rights, with Chinese leaders. On 16 November 2004, I raised the issue of Tibet, and recent developments there, during official talks with Vice Premier Huang Ju in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, encourages the continuation of the dialogue between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama. I am pleased that representatives of the Dalai Lama met the Chinese authorities in Beijing from 12-29 September 2004. Previous meetings between China and Tibetan envoys took place in September 2002 and May-June 2003. This third meeting in September 2004 was generally characterised as positive by Mr. Lodi Gyari, the special envoy of the Dalai Lama. For the first time, there was a substantive discussion between Chinese and Tibetan representatives on major, sometimes fundamental differences, including the issue of the delimitation of Tibet and the scope of autonomy.</P>
        <P>The statement by the Dalai Lama on 10 March 2005, in which he reiterated his commitment to the &ldquo;Middle Way&rdquo; approach which addresses the issue of Tibet within the framework of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, was welcome.</P><Col N="1875"/>
        <P>Together with our EU partners, the Government will continue to encourage the Chinese authorities to respect fully the human rights of all citizens, including those of the people of Tibet. For my part, I will continue to avail of my discussions with Chinese representatives to express our position in regard to these matters.</P>

        <P>With the help of the international community, the transitional government has been working towards holding free and fair elections. The transitional government intends to conduct the elections in two phases, first holding local elections in November 2005 and subsequently holding parliamentary and presidential elections in December 2005, with a view to having a democratically elected Haitian government in place by February 2006.</P>
        <P>United Nations forces are playing a key role in facilitating the elections in Haiti. The United Nations mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, led by Brazil, has been present since July 2004 when it replaced the multi-national interim force led by the United States which had been in the country since the interim government was formed in February 2004. MINUSTAH is working with local authorities to launch civic education programmes to prepare for the elections, and is cooperating in demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration efforts. It is also playing an important role in combating urban armed gangs, which continue to pose a major barrier to security in the slums of Haiti&rsquo;s cities. Disarming urban gangs is of particular importance for the election process, since one of the main obstacles to voter registration has been urban violence, which has deterred potential voters from registering.</P>
        <P>Together with other international agencies such as the Organisation of American States, MINUSTAH is now actively combating armed gangs with the aim of establishing a satisfactory <Col N="1876"/>security situation by the time elections take place. In June 2005, the Security Council extended the mission in Haiti until February 2006 and approved a temporary increase in the strength of the mission in order to provide increased security in advance of the elections. The Security Council also urged the Haitian authorities to increase and accelerate efforts to prepare for and ensure the smooth conduct of the elections, and called on international donors to provide the necessary resources to support the election process.</P>
        <P>The EU is also actively involved in efforts to restore democracy to Haiti. At an EU-Latin American ministerial meeting which I attended in Luxembourg on 27 May 2005, the importance of comprehensive, long-term aid to enable the Haitian people to work towards the establishment of a violence free, inclusive democratic system was acknowledged. The EU pledged &euro;294 million for comprehensive development projects in the country at the Washington donor conference for Haiti which took place in July 2004. Furthermore, the European Commission recently undertook an exploratory mission to Haiti to examine whether an EU election observation mission would be possible. The Europe Aid Co-operation Office is currently seeking nominations for long-term and short-term observers.</P>

	<P>On 27 June last, I attended a summit level meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference co-chaired by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, at 10 Downing Street. The meeting was also attended by the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Mr. David Hanson, and by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Mr. Shaun Woodward.</P>
        <P>The conference reviewed recent political developments, including the results of the Westminster and local government elections in early May and contacts since then with the Northern Ireland parties. The meeting affirmed the intention of the two Governments to work with all parties to achieve political progress. The conference agreed that the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland could only be achieved in the context of a complete cessation of paramilitary and criminal activity by the IRA and a full and irreversible decommissioning of its weapons.</P><Col N="1877"/>
        <P>Following on from that meeting, I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, on 7 July at Hillsborough to discuss the prospects for political progress and to engage with him on current political and security issues of concern, including the summer marching season and parades. In addition, I have maintained close contact with representatives of the political parties both formally and informally. In July I met informally with representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in. On 8 September last I met representatives of the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in in Belfast to discuss the increased tensions and the upsurge in loyalist violence which was all too evident in parts of Northern Ireland this summer.</P>
        <P>During my visit I also met with community representatives from the Springfield Road area which suffered subsequent loyalist protest and rioting in response to the Parades Commission determination on the Whiterock Orange march on 10 September. I paid a further visit to Belfast and north Antrim on 22 September to meet with people recently affected by sectarian attacks and street violence, including residents from the Springfield Road and Parkside in Belfast and some of the families affected by sectarian attacks in north Antrim. I assured all those I met of the Government&rsquo;s determination to be proactive in challenging sectarianism at every opportunity.</P>
        <P>I had a further meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Hain, in Belfast on 21 September 2005 to review political developments since our meeting in July and to prepare for the next meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We also discussed relevant political and security issues, including the regrettable recent upsurge in loyalist violence.</P>
        <P>On 23 September, together with the Taoiseach, I met with representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in. The meeting, which was Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s first formal meeting with the Government since January, was held in a constructive atmosphere. We impressed upon Sinn F&eacute;in that the bedrock of further progress would be delivery by the IRA on decommissioning and a definitive and demonstrable end to its links with all forms of criminal activity.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to the meeting with Sinn F&eacute;in, the confirmation on 26 September by the Independent International Monitoring Commission on Decommissioning that the IRA had put all its weapons beyond use was a further significant step in restoring trust and confidence in the peace process. Both Governments will now work with the parties to rebuild political momentum so that we are in a position to move ahead should the reports of the International Monitoring Commission in October and January be favourable. The next meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which the Secretary of State and I will co-chair in the coming weeks, will be a further opportunity for the Governments to progress our work to implement the Good Friday <Col N="1878"/>Agreement and to bring to fruition the stable, democratic and prosperous future the people of Northern Ireland deserve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The United Nations has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. The EU enlargement process provided the impetus for the most recent efforts towards a settlement, which were undertaken by the UN Secretary General in the first half of 2004, during Ireland&rsquo;s term of the EU Presidency.</P>
        <P>As a result of the referendums in Cyprus on 24 April 2004, the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May 2004 was not possible. On 28 May, the UN Secretary General submitted a comprehensive report to the Security Council on his mission of good offices. He noted at the time that the unsuccessful outcome represented another missed opportunity to resolve the Cyprus problem, and concluded that there was no apparent basis for resuming the good offices effort while the stalemate continued. The process has remained under consideration in the UN Security Council since then.</P>
        <P>In May of this year, following discussions with the UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, the President of Cyprus, Mr. Tassos Papadopoulos, sent an envoy to New York for preliminary, informal talks with senior officials in the UN Secretariat. As a result of these discussions, the Secretary General asked Mr. Kieran Prendergast, the Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, to travel to Cyprus, Athens and Ankara to listen to the views of all parties on the future of the mission of good offices on Cyprus.</P>
        <P>On 22 June 2005, the Under Secretary-General, Mr. Prendergast, reported to the Security Council on his consultations. Despite certain positive elements, he reported that the gap between the stated positions of the parties on substance appeared to be wide. The Secretary General and United Nations officials continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
        <P>The Government has strongly supported the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, in his mission of good offices. The EU remains ready to accommodate a settlement of the Cyprus problem based on the Secretary General&rsquo;s proposals and in line with the principles on which the Union is founded. The objective we all share is an agreed comprehensive settlement, which will enable the people of Cyprus to live together as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union. I have <Col N="1879"/>consistently availed of all opportunities, including my visits to Cyprus and Turkey in July of this year, to encourage commitment to the UN process and to the achievement of an agreed outcome.</P>

	<P>The Government continues to work with its partners in the European Union to advance efforts for a peaceful and lasting resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Consideration of the Middle East peace process has been a central element in my contacts in recent months with political leaders from the region, and in my discussions in the UN context and at meetings of EU Foreign Ministers.</P>
        <P>In July, I visited the region in my capacity as envoy of the UN Secretary General. On 12 July, I met with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Silvan Shalom, and the Israeli Vice Premier, Mr. Shimon Peres. I also met in Ramallah with the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s President, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, Prime Minister, Mr. Ahmed Qurei, Foreign Minister, Mr. Nasser Al-Kidwa and Planning Minister, Mr. Nabil Kassis. In addition to discussing issues relating to UN reform, we had wide-ranging talks on our bilateral relations and on the course of the peace process.</P>
        <P>I had further discussions with the Egyptian Minister, Mr. Al-Kidwa and Foreign Minister, Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit on 15 September, while I was in New York for the UN summit. In my address to the UN General Assembly on 19 September, I highlighted the importance which <Col N="1880"/>Ireland, and the international community, attaches to the achievement of a lasting peace in the Middle East.</P>
        <P>I welcomed the courage and commitment shown by the Israeli Government in ensuring that the initial phase of disengagement from Gaza proceeded peacefully. I welcomed the determination of the Palestinian Authority to take full advantage of the opportunity presented by the withdrawal. Disengagement has been an important advance. The challenge facing the parties now is to build on this progress and to renew efforts towards full implementation of the international quartet roadmap. The Government will ensure Ireland plays a constructive role, in co-operation with the parties and with the international community, in the continuing efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region.</P>

	<P>Ethiopia is one of Ireland&rsquo;s programme countries for overseas development assistance and is one of the poorest countries in the world. Ethiopia is ranked 177 on the UN human development index out of a total of 177 countries ranked. It is estimated that expenditures on the programme of development assistance will amount to approximately &euro;30 million this year. Additional funding will be channelled through NGOs, UN agencies and missionaries.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme in Ethiopia aims to support a process of poverty-reducing, self-reliant, sustainable and equitable growth. The programme is closely aligned with the national poverty reduction programmes of the Ethiopian Government. There is a clear focus on health, education and HIV-AIDS. For example, in Ethiopia there is only one doctor for every 36,000 people. Ireland is therefore supporting ambitious plans to place qualified health workers in every locality. Ireland is supporting interventions at the national and local levels with the aims of increasing awareness and facilitating voluntary testing and counselling in HIV-AIDS.</P>
        <P>Ethiopia is subject to frequent drought and food insecurity. Ireland, through its emergency and humanitarian programmes, has sought to address the immediate needs of millions of those most affected. Ireland is now incorporating within its overall programme of assistance longer term initiatives to address the fundamental causes of food insecurity. Additionally, we are helping to build the capacity of the Ethiopian Government to design social safety nets, which will prevent millions from falling into destitution and star<Col N="1881"/>vation in difficult times. Under the safety nets programme, up to 5 million people will receive cash for labour.</P>

	<P>Zambia is one of Ireland&rsquo;s priority countries for overseas development assistance. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, placed 166 on the UN human development index out of a total of 177 countries ranked. It is estimated expenditure on the development programme will amount to &euro;18 million in 2005. Additional funding is also being channelled through NGOs and missionaries.</P>
        <P>The overall objective of Ireland&rsquo;s development programme in Zambia is to work with the Zambian Government, donor partners, civil society and local communities to reduce poverty and build sustainable livelihoods. To this end Ireland promotes social sector development, particularly health and education, works with local government in Zambia&rsquo;s northern province and supports democratic processes. Obstacles that create or reinforce poverty such as HIV-AIDS and poor governance receive special attention. Our development strategy has a focus on service delivery as well as policy development and institutional capacity building of our Zambian partners.</P>
        <P>The programme supports the goal of the Zambian Government&rsquo;s poverty reduction strategy to reverse Zambia&rsquo;s deteriorating socio-economic conditions and to contribute to the millennium development goals. The Zambian Government is preparing a new national development plan for 2006 to 2011. We will continue to align our programme with the national plan to maximise our effectiveness and to bring about real and positive change in the lives of the Zambian people.</P>

	<P>Ireland is deeply <Col N="1882"/>engaged in the humanitarian and recovery needs of Sudan, both in the emergency needs in the Darfur region and also the longer term needs of other parts of Sudan which are now emerging from conflict. The ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur involves considerable emergency needs for the displaced population of over 2 million people. Ireland has been extremely active in addressing these humanitarian needs including through our NGOs and UN agencies.</P>
        <P>I visited Darfur in April 2005 and witnessed at first hand the effects of the conflict on the displaced population. I also met with NGOs and UN agencies working on the ground in Darfur which are making a huge contribution to the humanitarian response across the region. The terrible plight of the displaced, which I witnessed, reinforced the importance of providing a secure environment, so that those affected will be able to return safely to their homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, met with the Sudanese acting Foreign Minister, Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail, in New York on 19 September 2005. The Minister stressed the importance which Ireland attaches to resolving the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, the need for improvement of the security situation there and speedy conclusion of the political negotiations underway in Abuja between the Sudanese Government and the rebels.</P>
        <P>Since 2004, Ireland has provided over &euro;8.8 million in emergency support to Darfur. In addition, Ireland has committed &euro;1.5 million since 2004 in support to the human rights, humanitarian and peace-building components of the African Union Mission in Sudan.</P>
        <P>With regard to Ireland&rsquo;s assistance elsewhere in Sudan, over 20 years of civil conflict has decimated the infrastructure and services of this vast country. The comprehensive peace agreement signed in Nairobi on 9 January 2005 provides new hope for the future of Sudan. At the international donor conference on Sudan, held in Oslo on 11 and 12 April 2005, I made a pledge of &euro;15 million in support from Ireland to Sudan over 2005 to 2007.</P>
        <P>Already in 2005, Ireland has committed some &euro;8 million of its pledge in support to Sudan. Programming of the remainder of Ireland&rsquo;s support will be consistent with the UN&rsquo;s recovery and reconstruction plans for Sudan. Emergency and recovery funding support of &euro;1.7 million for the south of Sudan has been provided already in 2005, <i>inter alia</i>, to Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res and the UN World Food Programme and UNICEF. Ireland continues to attach considerable importance to responding to the needs of vulnerable populations across Sudan.</P>

	<P>Since 2004, an early end to the rains and desert locust damage to crops and pasture lands have adversely affected pasture availability and cereal production in the Sahel region of west Africa. These events exacerbated existing poverty and vulnerability, resulting in severe food shortages across a wide region, including in Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Mauritania.</P>
        <P>In response, Ireland provided prompt funding support of &euro;3 million in August 2005. This was allocated and disbursed to Ireland&rsquo;s NGO and UN partners. The NGOs which received support from Ireland, including Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire, are delivering feeding programmes which range from supplementary food distributions directed at the most vulnerable women and children to targeted community therapeutic feeding of moderately and severely malnourished children.</P>
        <P>In addition to this funding, I asked Mr. David Andrews, chairman of the Irish Red Cross, to report on the findings of his visit to the region. He travelled there in August 2005 accompanied by an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Having assessed the situation, Mr. Andrews reported the country suffers persistent food insecurity but that extreme food shortages this year were caused by several converging factors, particularly the early end to the rains in 2004 which depressed agricultural yields, escalating food prices and invasion of locusts in some areas. Mr. Andrews estimated that 3.5 million people were in need of emergency food assistance and figures between 1 and 2 million people were classed as extremely vulnerable and needed food assistance urgently.</P>
        <P>According to the latest information from the region, there are 5.1 million people affected by the food crisis across the Sahel region, including Niger. Harvest prospects are now being described as favourable. However, Niger remains vulnerable to repeated crises of food insecurity and malnutrition due to high household indebtedness and structural poverty. With regard to the particular circumstances prevailing in the region, humanitarian situation will continue to be kept under close and ongoing review over the coming period.</P>

	<P>Uganda is one of Ireland&rsquo;s programme countries for overseas development assistance. Uganda is placed 144 on <Col N="1884"/>the human development index out of a total of 177 countries ranked. It is estimated that expenditure on the development programme in Uganda will amount to approximately &euro;29 million in 2005. Additional funding will be delivered via NGOs, missionaries and UN agencies.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s development programme in Uganda is focused on poverty reduction and on assisting the most vulnerable sections of the population. The overall goal of Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Uganda&rsquo;s efforts to achieve a pro-poor and sustainable economic growth, equitable social development and democratic governance. Support is provided in the key sectors of education, health and HIV-AIDS, justice, law and order/governance and agriculture.</P>
        <P>Uganda is one of the poorest countries in the world. There are, however, some encouraging signs. Arising from a committed partnership between the Ugandan Government and donor countries, literacy rates have risen to 69% of the population. School enrolment is at 86% of children. Uganda is one of the few countries in sub-Saharan Africa that will meet the millennium development goal of having achieved universal primary education by 2015. Progress has been made in the provision of improved health, water and other services to the poor of the country.</P>
        <P>Support for good governance has been a key component of Ireland&rsquo;s development programme in Uganda. Assistance has been provided for the justice, law and order sector and for activities promoting protection of human rights and democratisation and combating corruption. Several donor countries, including Ireland, have made known their concerns about the pace of democratic reform and the transition to a multi-party system in Uganda. To signal this concern, and in line with the actions of donor partners, the Government decided to reduce its budget support for the 2005-6 fiscal year by &euro;3 million. In close co-operation with other donors, this situation is kept under constant review.</P>
        <P>I have arranged to forward a copy of the Development Co-operation Ireland 2004 report which details the work of Development Co-operation Ireland in Uganda and a copy of the country strategy paper for Uganda for 2003-2005 to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>South Africa is an important recipient of Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development assistance, ODA. South Africa is placed 120th on the UN human development index, HDI, out of a total of 177 countries <Col N="1885"/>ranked. Ireland&rsquo;s programme is aimed at assisting the Government and people of South Africa to reduce poverty and exclusion and build the nation in the aftermath of the legacy of apartheid. Our development assistance is increasingly delivered at provincial, district and local municipal level. It is estimated that Ireland will provide over &euro;10 million in assistance to South Africa in 2005. Additional funding is also delivered through non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and missionaries.</P>
        <P>A feature of the South Africa country programme is that almost half of the assistance is expended supporting the work of civil society across a number of sectors. These include HIV-AIDS and governance. In addition, we are increasing our support to Limpopo province, one of the poorest in South Africa. Ireland is helping in meeting the water, sanitation and education needs in that province.</P>
        <P>I have arranged to send the Deputy a copy of the annual report for 2004, which details the work of Development Co-operation Ireland in South Africa that year and a copy of the South Africa country strategy.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach announced at the UN Millennium Summit review in New York on 14 September that the Government will reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance, ODA, by 2012.</P>
        <P>This is three years earlier than the agreed EU target date of 2015. It places Ireland in the front rank of donors worldwide, in terms of both the quality and the volume of assistance we provide to the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. I am pleased that this decision has received a broad welcome from the development community. It is worth noting that the 2012 timeframe was my stated and public preference some months ago, when I initiated the public consultations on the White Paper on development.</P>
        <P>The increases involved are very significant. On the basis of current anticipated growth rates, spending on ODA would be of the order of &euro;1.5 billion in 2012. From 2005 to 2012, we will spend as much as &euro;8 billion on overseas aid.</P>
        <P>We have agreed a number of steps along the way to reaching the target. First, we have an interim target of 0.5% of GNP in 2007. The aid budget will reach &euro;773 million in that year. Second, aid spending is expected to reach 0.6% of GNP in 2010. We have a clear pathway to achieving the UN target in 2012. The commitment of this Government to overseas development cannot be doubted.</P>
        <P>Spending on overseas aid this year, at &euro;545 million, is the highest level in the history of the programme. Ireland&rsquo;s aid budget has tripled since this Government came into office. With this announcement, it will triple again by 2012. In addition to the increased resources, we have ensured that the programme is of the highest quality. The high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is recognised by both NGOs and donors. The most recent peer review of the programme by the OECD said that Ireland is &ldquo;at the cutting edge of international development policy&rdquo;. I am determined that these high standards will be maintained as the programme continues to expand.</P>

	<P>Following the referendum results in France and <Col N="1887"/>the Netherlands, the June European Council meeting decided to initiate a period of reflection with regard to the European constitution. The intention is that member states should avail of this opportunity to hold national debates on European issues, including the European constitution. Next week, as part of this process, the Government will publish the White Paper on the European constitution which gives a factual description of the constitution and Ireland&rsquo;s approach to its negotiation. The White Paper should contribute to raising awareness of the constitution and the issues it addresses.</P>
        <P>The Heads of State and Government will review the position regarding the constitution during the Austrian Presidency in 2006. This means the constitution cannot now enter into force as originally intended on 1 November 2006.</P>
        <P>While the Government regrets the delay in bringing the constitution into effect, it is clear that the decision to engage in a period of reflection was the best option available to the European Council in the light of the uncertainties created by the French and Dutch votes. We remain committed to the constitution and hope to see it ratified as soon as possible. Until the position is clarified at the European level, it is not intended to set a date for a referendum in Ireland. A similar approach has been adopted in those other member states which intend to ratify the constitution by referendum.</P>

	<P>CSO data for August 2005 shows 6,028 people on the live register for County Kerry, but this figure is not broken down for north Kerry. The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland. The IDA strategy for Kerry has a sectoral focus and is concentrated on achieving developments in the international services, engineering and ICT sectors, focusing particularly on the NSS designated linked hubs of Tralee and Killarney. At the end of 2004, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA supported companies in County Kerry. Shannon Development is responsible for supporting Irish industry and for provid<Col N="1890"/>ing industrial property solutions in north Kerry. At the end of 2004, there were 2,029 employed in Shannon Development assisted companies. New jobs created by Shannon Development companies in 2004 totalled 106 and the main contributing companies to this were Altobridge Ltd., Kerry Group, GCX Ltd., Cameo Products Ltd., and Kerryman Ltd.</P>
        <P>Kerry technology park, which is owned and managed by Shannon Development and developed in partnership with the Institute of Technology Tralee, opened for business in July 2001. Kerry technology park is part of the Shannon Development knowledge network, which consists five such parks. Shannon Development&rsquo;s Listowel business centre was officially opened on June 27 2005. The 10,500 square foot building, located on a 2 acre site at Clieveragh, involved an investment of &euro;1.7 million, funded by Shannon Development. The building provides units over two storeys which can accommodate companies ranging in size from start-ups or smaller indigenous companies to a larger mobile indigenous or overseas project. Two indigenous start-ups have located there, Glasnua Ltd. and Payback Software.</P>
        <P>For the period 2000 to 2004, the Kerry County Enterprise Board approved &euro;1.25 million in financial assistance to 125 businesses based in north Kerry. This assistance and other financial supports have resulted in the creation and maintenance of 164 jobs in north Kerry over this period. In the first nine months of this year the Kerry County Enterprise Board has approved grant aid in the sum of &euro;385,755 in respect of 47 micro-enterprise projects, over half of this investment is for projects in north Kerry with a potential to create 26 full-time jobs and 26 part-time jobs. My Department, through its agencies, will continue to address the employment needs of north Kerry and in promoting the area for suitable investment projects in the future.</P>

	<P>Since 1997, the numbers in employment have grown by 31%, from 1.5 million to a current level of over 1.9 million. Correspondingly, during this period, unemployment levels have dropped by 50%, from 171,200 to 85,600. A number of factors contributed to the dramatic economic growth which has resulted in continuing increases in employment, these include the expansion of the labour force, highly educated workforce, attraction of foreign direct investment and social partnership. All of these elements will continue to make an important contribution to future growth of the economy and employment.</P>
        <P>Competitiveness is a key issue for our continued economic growth. Our economy is no longer a low cost one but typified by high output, high value added, high returns to labour and improving living standards. In pursuit of a knowledge-based economy, the continuing structural adjustment of our economy is necessary and will continue as high value added services increasingly become the wealth and employment drivers of the future. To offset any competitive threat from lower wage economies, a number of policies are being implemented to encourage a move to higher productivity and the use of technology to invigorate enterprise.</P>
        <P>Future economic success lies in our ability to create sustainable employment by both attracting and growing companies with higher profitability and operating at the more sophisticated end of the value chain. The enterprise development agencies are working to source new investment by a combination of developing existing clients and new investors in existing or new activities or sectors and have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to help businesses to generate high quality employment opportunities. An example of this is a &euro;20 million productivity improvement fund, launched by Enterprise Ireland, to help indigenous firms invest in the very technology, equipment and employee training that will give them the opportunities to win more business and survive against international competition. In addition, many IDA Ireland client companies who operate in less technologically advanced sectors are making significant new investments in high technology projects, including some notable research and development investments, which require high skill levels and, therefore, are a better fit with our competitive attri<Col N="1892"/>butes. The agency is also continuing its investment promotion activities to generate new flows of foreign direct investment into Ireland and is working to identify and support new investment opportunities out of the existing client base.</P>
        <P>There is also the need to encourage greater participation in further education and training in order to equip all individuals with the skills needed in an economy which is increasingly becoming knowledge based and innovation driven. The focus now is to upgrade the competencies and qualifications of the workforce, particularly those with low skill levels and in low level occupations, through providing targeted training programmes by way of in-company training and training for the unemployed. The current policies to encourage enterprise and investment will lead to continued economic and employment growth, thereby keeping unemployment low.</P>

	<P>According to the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s recently published global competitiveness report for 2005-06 Ireland has moved up four places from 30th to 26th out of 117 countries. This higher ranking is testament to the Government&rsquo;s committed efforts to strengthen our competitiveness. The improvement in Ireland&rsquo;s national competitiveness is further supported by the findings of the National Competitiveness Council&rsquo;s annual competitiveness report for 2005. This report highlights several encouraging statistics, which show that we are broadly implementing the right mix of policies. In 2004, the number of people in employment in Ireland grew strongly with almost 1.9 million in employment by the end of the year. Consumer inflation stabilised and in fact by mid 2005 Ireland&rsquo;s rate of inflation was below the euro-zone average. Government finances remained healthy and our investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP is approximately twice the EU average at 5%. Ireland has a very strong competitive advantage based on low direct personal and corporation taxes. In fact, the ACR 2005 finds that Ireland continues to rank 1st out of 16 for both these taxes. In the area of business regulation, Ireland also has a significant competitive advantage. Our social partnership process has and continues to create a benign business environment with both a stable fiscal and wage setting regime. Our demographic profile with our young and well-educated workforce also remains a key competitive advantage.</P><Col N="1893"/>
        <P Just="Left">However, the ACR 2005 also highlights two principal areas where Ireland&rsquo;s performance could be improved. The first is our price and cost competitiveness, which has been eroded in recent years. Combined with a weak dollar exchange rate, this means that Ireland is now an expensive production location relative to several of our trading partners. A key factor in improving cost competitiveness is robust consumer and competition policies. The Government had already put in place the necessary measures to establish a national consumer agency to advocate the consumer&rsquo;s case. The Government has also implemented a successful reform process of the insurance sector and increased the powers and the resources of the Competition Authority, to aid it in tackling any anti-competitive practices in the Irish economy.</P>
        <P>The second area of concern arising from the ACR 2005 is the significant discrepancies in the productivity performance of the Irish economy. Ireland&rsquo;s productivity growth has been concentrated in a small number of sectors, such as the chemicals and pharmaceuticals, which are dominated by foreign companies. However, there is evidence of much weaker productivity growth in sectors of the Irish economy less exposed to international competition such as retail, construction, general services and in some sectors of indigenous manufacturing. To address this issue the enterprise agencies of my Department have been mandated to adjust their support strategies to the needs of their clients in the modern global economy. For example, Enterprise Ireland has launched a &euro;20 million productivity improvement fund, which will assist Irish firms in their drive for higher efficiency and international competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Government is determined to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and the conditions for businesses operating here are as favourable as possible. In this context, the Government looks forward to receiving the NCC&rsquo;s competitiveness challenge report 2005, which is due to be published later this year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>According to figures published by the Central Statistics Office for 2004, which is the latest year for which full year figures are available, total exports from Ireland amounted to &euro;84.2 billion while total imports amounted to &euro;51 billion. This resulted in an overall trade surplus of &euro;32.8 billion. Ireland has had a significant trade surplus as between exports over imports for a number of years. Figures available for the first <Col N="1894"/>half of this year show that overall, exports increased by 1% in the six month period to June 2005 when compared with the same period in 2004. This represents a very creditable performance on the part of Irish exporters in a difficult trading environment against the background of the current global economic slowdown, in particular the slow growth in the major European economies of France, Germany and Italy and the continuing high level of the euro against the dollar and the pound. I am confident that as the worst of the economic slowdown eases, Irish exporters are well placed to take advantage of a European recovery in the second half of the year.</P>
        <P>Irish Government policy has been, for a number of years, to exploit fully our membership of the European Union by diversifying into EU export markets, and also to focus on new opportunities in the US and further afield. From a position of 75% of Irish exports going to the UK in 1960, we have now reached a point where the EU now accounts for 62% of our exports with only 18% of exports going to the UK. Since last year, the US has replaced the UK as our leading export market and now accounts for 20% of Irish exports. Of equal importance is the continuous transformation of both indigenous and foreign direct investment enterprises from low end manufacturing to the production of high value added goods and services such as software, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals resulting in new export opportunities to highly developed economies in the EU, the US and Japan. Other export destinations, which offer new opportunities in the future, are the ten newly accessed members of the EU and Asia. Both the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have been active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to the new member states with a view to increasing our share of exports by Irish companies to these regions.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year, the Taoiseach launched the second phase of the Asia strategy which is designed to increase Irish exports to the main economies of Asia, such as China, Japan and India, over the next five years. Within the context of the Asia strategy, it is envisaged that enterprise development agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland, An Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and organisations engaged in the education sector, will be combining closely to exploit and increase Irish exporting opportunities in this area over the lifetime of the Asia strategy, which is scheduled to run until 2009.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of most social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based on the income of the spouse or partner. A qualified adult increase at the maximum rate is payable where the spouse or partner&rsquo;s income is &euro;88.88 per week or less and tapered reduced rates are payable where income is less than &euro;220 per week. The lower threshold was last increased in the budget in 2000 while the upper threshold has been increased in each successive budget since then, from &euro;171.42 in 2000 to &euro;220 in 2005. Any change in the current arrangements relating to entitlement to qualified adult allowances would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or Health Service Executive payments towards meeting their additional heating needs during the winter season. Under the scheme a fuel allowance of &euro;9.00 per week is paid to eligible households during a 29 week winter heating period from the end of October to mid-April each year. An additional &euro;3.90 per week is payable in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones. About 274,000 households receive a fuel allowance, at an expected cost of &euro;85.4 million this year. In addition over 300,000 pensioners and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>
        <P>Pensioners and other social welfare groups have received significant increases in their welfare payment rates this year and in recent years. This has improved their income situation considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. These higher rates of primary payments are payable for a full 52 weeks of the year. I am currently examining options for additional support to social welfare customers in preparation for the budget in December. An extension of the fuel allowance scheme duration at the end of the season is one such option, though this would have very significant cost implications and would have to be considered along with other social welfare priorities in the context of the budget. In the short term I <Col N="1896"/>have requested community welfare officers to deal sympathetically with any hardship cases that come to their attention.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health service executive payments and who are unable to meet the cost of their heating needs during the winter season from October to April. Residents of local authority accommodation where central heating is provided at a subsidised level are not currently eligible for the fuel allowance. In a recent review carried out by my Department, it emerged that the person concerned is residing in accommodation where subsidised heating is provided by Dublin City Council, and is therefore not currently entitled to the allowance.</P>

My Department provided &euro;1.64 million in funding towards essential infrastructural improvements at the airport in the period 2001-04. A further &euro;1.98 million has been allocated in support of nine separate projects including runway safety improvements, referred to above. This new round of projects will be undertaken at the airport between now and 2007. A number of safety related projects, including a runway-end safety area have been approved under the regional airports measure of the NDP. In appraising capital investment proposals, the priority is to focus on improvement works and upgrades in facilities that maintain continued safe and viable operations. The airport company has not sought funding under the NDP measure for the extension of the runway.</P>

        <P>Specifically, the regulations provide that all lamps showing a light to the front of a vehicle <Col N="1899"/>must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 ft. away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle.

Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 sets out a new process for the making of speed limit by-laws by the elected members and expands the range of options available to county and city councils in regard to the deployment of special speed limits.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A legislative provision to provide for the application of a special speed limit to operate during specific periods of the day such as when school children are entering or leaving a school premises became operative on 20 January 2005.

Copies of the document were placed in the Oireachtas Library at the time and the guidelines are also available on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.transport.ie</i>, under roads/publications.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are required to have regard to these guidelines when applying special speed limits and in the case of applying the 30 km/h special speed limit that is provided for in the 2004 Act, it may only be pursued in accordance with provisions in these guidelines.</P><Col N="1900"/>
        <P>Decisions as to whether or not to apply a special speed limit at a particular location or to apply a special speed limit that is operative on a periodic basis are matters that fall to be determined by the local authority having complied with consultation and consent processes required under the 2004 Act. The decision as to whether or not to deploy a school warden service at any particular location is also a local matter that falls to be determined by the local authority.</P>

It is a basic requirement of the scheme that animals be recorded on my Department&rsquo;s CMMS database as being in the herd of the applicant on the date of application for the scheme. I indicated that my Department was not aware of any special circumstances concerning the case.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, the person named contacted the Department in writing, outlining the circumstances that led to the animals being non-CMMS-compliant. However, having considered the case further, it has been concluded that the circumstances as outlined are not such as would allow payment for the animals concerned. It is open to the person named to submit an appeal to the Agriculture Appeals Office, should the person named so wish.</P>

	<P>The joint committee&rsquo;s examination of the early retirement scheme provided a welcome opportunity to air a wide range of issues and I believe that this in itself has been helpful in clarifying the position. Earlier this month, I provided a detailed response to the report. Regrettably, I have not been able to accept a number of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations. They are precluded by elements of the EU regulations under which the current scheme and its predecessor are operated. The European Commission has rejected a complaint brought against my Department on most of the issues which were also covered in the committee&rsquo;s report. However, the committee made other recommendations which I am still considering.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under categories B and D. Category B caters for farmers who between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003 made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.</P>
        <P>The person named applied to be considered under section (i) of category B on the basis that he made an investment by acquiring land during the qualifying period 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003. A copy of the lease agreement submitted by him shows that the commencement date of the lease was 1 December 2004. Since this <Col N="1906"/>date is outside the qualifying period he is ineligible for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve under category B(i).</P>
        <P>The application under category D from the person named was also considered and it was found that while he commenced farming in 2002, he received direct payments in respect of the 2002 scheme year, namely special beef premium in respect of 16 animals. Under the EU rules governing the single payment scheme, he cannot be deemed a new entrant and will not therefore receive an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve under category D.</P>
        <P>The person named also applied as a new entrant during the reference period. Years 2000 and 2001 were omitted and the person named was notified that he was accepted as a new entrant during the reference period on 17 February 2005.

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under categories C and D. Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.</P>
        <P>Applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received from over 17,500 farmers. Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants by 1 December next. The Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed. It should be noted, however, that the rules governing the single payment scheme stipulate that an applicant who is found to be eligible under more than one category in the reserve may only receive an allocation of entitlements under whichever category is most beneficial to him or her.</P>

	<P>The disposal of waste materials generally is covered by the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2005, which apply to all sectors of society including the agricultural sector and is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, manufacturers and importers of farm plastics, that is, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste. My Department has no involvement in the running of the scheme. Participants in REPS are required to avail of a recycling collection facility, such as the IFFPG scheme, where one exists, and to store such waste plastics neatly and safely on the farm pending disposal.</P>

	<P>The visa application was received in August 2005. The visa application was refused for two reasons. First, the visa officer was not satisfied that a previous relationship history existed between the applicant and the reference in Ireland. Second, financial information was not provided, therefore the visa officer could not be satisfied that there would be no recourse to public funds or resources. An appeal of the decision to refuse the visa application was subsequently submitted. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently, the application was refused on appeal on 27 September 2005.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Garda personnel deployment levels throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible service is provided to the public.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of each Garda district within the Wicklow region will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order <Col N="1911"/>offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda Traffic Corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

        <P>The definition of a racially motivated crime has been agreed and circulated throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

        <P Just="Left">Furthermore, the Garda racial and intercultural office, which was established in 2001, co-ordinates, monitors and advises on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity. Personnel in that office monitor all incidents to ensure that the PULSE system is accurately recording all such offences. Where such incidents occur, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ensure that an investigation is pursued with reference mainly to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, these being the main relevant legislative instruments pertaining to crime of this type.</P>

	<P>The Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks. As the Deputy will be aware, last February I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document which are currently being examined.</P>
        <P>It is already clear, from the submissions received, that, among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House, to bring forward, on Committee Stage of that Bill, amendments which will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to significantly increase penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>

	<P>It appears in this case that the parent(s) brought their child, an Irish born citizen, to their country of origin to stay with family <Col N="1914"/>members. Both parents had originally entered this State illegally and separately, and later had their subsequent applications for asylum refused, with one being deemed &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;. Following the birth of a child they both obtained residency based on parentage of an Irish born child.</P>
        <P>The appropriate course of action in a case like this, where parent(s) bring their child out of the country to stay with a family member, is that the parent(s) should bring the child back into the country themselves. Clearly it remains open to one or both of the parents resident in the State to travel to their country of origin to accompany the child on her return.</P>
        <P>A visa officer will have to have regard to a number of factors, including the immigration history of the sponsor(s), when deciding on a visa application.</P>
        <P>As regards the cost and expense involved in changing flights etc., I refer the Deputy to the advice in the visa information leaflet that accompanies application forms, which states that &ldquo;travel tickets should not be booked or paid for by applicants until their applications have been approved&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The person concerned has made two separate applications for permission to remain in the State. The first was made in June 2004 on the basis of marriage to an Irish national and the second this year under the revised processing arrangements for parents of Irish born children. The second application has been successful and a letter of permission will issue to the person concerned shortly. Because of this no further processing is required on the marriage to an Irish national application.</P>

	<P>The post-primary curriculum for the study of Irish has the capacity to cater for a wide diversity of ability. Nevertheless, provision exists for exemption from the study of Irish in limited special circumstances. The guidelines in relation to an exemption from the study of Irish at post-primary level are set out in circular letter M10/94. Under the terms of this circular, my Department has delegated authority to the principals of post-primary schools to grant the exemptions provided the student meets the criteria as set down.</P>
        <P>The criteria provide that exemptions may be granted by school authorities for students whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland; students who were previously enrolled as recognised students in a primary school or post-primary school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the student is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment; and certain categories of students with special educational needs as set out in Circular M10/94; or students from abroad, who have no understanding of English when enrolled.</P>

In May 2005, the three schools in question were each notified of their general allocation teaching hours and the schools with which they were to be clustered. The schools&rsquo; management authorities subsequently submitted an alternative proposal to my Department to reorganise the cluster of schools to enable the three schools to share a full-time post. In this regard, I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the schools&rsquo; authorities were notified in writing on 5 August 2005 that a permanent, full-time teaching post was approved to cater for the LS-RT needs of the three schools.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides a statutory scheme of financial redress for persons who, as children, were abused while in residential institutional care. The scheme applies in respect of institutions specified in the <Col N="1923"/>Schedule to the Act. Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of additional institutions in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and/or solicitors about various institutions not specified in the Schedule, including the facility mentioned by the Deputy. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 adding three institutions to the Schedule.</P>
        <P>The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule at this point.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s higher education grants scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously. The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.</P>
        <P>Clause 7.7 of the higher education grants scheme does provide for financial assistance to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course which represents progression. As the postgraduate degree in education does not represent progression from a postgraduate course in computers as defined in Clause 7.7. of the scheme, the student referred to by the Deputy is not therefore eligible for grant assistance.</P>
        <P>However, tax relief is available in respect of postgraduate fees paid in publicly funded colleges here and in other EU member states, as well as in private colleges in the State. This relief applies at the standard rate of tax and is available to full-time and part-time postgraduate students. Further details and conditions on this tax relief are available from local tax offices.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is currently engaged in the roll-out of broadband Internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools. This connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, email, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year &euro;18 million joint Government-IBEC/TIF fund.</P>
        <P>Following a competitive tender process, contracts have been agreed with six companies selected for the provision of access connectivity across the nearly 4,000 schools involved and with the other further company selected for the provision of a broadband router at school level. The schools national broadband network and the service desk are operational and the roll-out process of local connectivity to schools is under way. It is expected that the roll-out will be completed by March 2006.</P>
        <P>While the overall pace of school installations is agreed within the individual contacts with the companies concerned, the order and selection of individual school installations is a matter for each company. My Department would not be aware of when individual schools are scheduled to be connected.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 to 318, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There has been enormous progress made over the past number of years in the provision of resources, including accommodation, for special needs pupils. I am continuing to prioritise provision to ensure that all pupils with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>
        <P>On my plans to deliver 23 new post-primary schools and four new primary schools under a major expansion of the Government&rsquo;s public private partnership from 2006 to 2009, I can confirm that provision will be made in these schools for pupils with special educational needs. The level and range of accommodation and resources to be provided is likely to vary from school to school depending on the specific type of provision to be made and the specific needs of pupils presenting.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The details on individual schools will be factored into accommodation briefs following an examination of all the issues concerned by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, in association with the school planning section of my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005 the NCSE has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. These responsibilities include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours; and processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NCSE allocates additional teaching and other resources in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s resourcing policies to support the special educational needs of children with disabilities. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA sup<Col N="1926"/>port, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. In general where a special class for pupils with autism is established by my Department, such classes are staffed by one teacher and two special needs assistants and can cater for a maximum of six pupils. However, my Department provides for a flexible approach to applying these standard ratios to allow for individual school and pupil factors to be taken into account. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>
        <P>Where a school wishes to establish a special class in order to meet the special educational needs of children with disabilities, an application must be submitted to the relevant SENO. In this regard, it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that the establishment of such a class for pupils with autism within the school in question is currently under consideration. Other issues such as training, accommodation/buildings, furnishing and fittings should be applied for by the school authorities to my Department by way of normal procedure.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 579 of 21 June 2005.</P>
        <P>The 1990 regulations banning the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal were originally made to address the winter smog situation prevalent in the Dublin area at that time, and have since been extended to 15 other areas taking account of the analysis of air quality monitoring data and also of population size. On the basis of these criteria, the ban currently applies to two towns in County Wicklow, Bray and Arklow.</P><Col N="1930"/>
        <P>A June 2002 voluntary agreement between my Department and the solid fuel trade group provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the delivery of significantly cleaner standards for bituminous coal and petcoke on a phased basis. Under this agreement, there is currently a temporary moratorium on the designation of further coal ban areas during the life of the agreement except where required to ensure adherence to air quality standards. The agreement also provided for an initial review by end-2003 and a final review by end-2004, with the ambition of setting further targets from 2005 onwards.</P>
        <P>My Department reviewed the operation of the voluntary agreement in 2003 but the final review due by the end of December 2004 was postponed following the granting of a moratorium on the step down to 2004 sulphur levels in petcoke for the 2004-2005 heating season. The moratorium was requested by the trade group and was granted to help the industry through a difficult interim supply period, triggered by exceptional levels of demand for petcoke tonnages internationally which made the sourcing of lower sulphur fuels problematic for the industry.</P>
        <P>The agreement is now undergoing its final review and discussions are under way with a view to maximising environmental benefits from the new arrangements. It is not envisaged that the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal will be extended to rural areas.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the level of local government charges is determined by individual councils. Local variations in expenditure, income and rates of charges in respect of various services are therefore an inherent feature of the local government system. Charges take account of local circumstances and priorities and represent decisions of democratically elected local bodies.</P>
        <P>It is also right that local charges should be applied responsibly and in association with measures to increase the efficiency of local authority&rsquo;s operations and protect local competitiveness. My Department&rsquo;s advice to local authorities is informed by the above principles as, for example, in its recent advice to local authorities to adopt a reasonable and proportionate approach in the context of the new system of development levies.</P>

	<P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through its role as chair of the national steering committee on violence against women, has overall responsibility for issues relating to violence against women.</P>
        <P>With regard to accommodation, capital funding is available through my Department&rsquo;s capital assistance scheme to voluntary housing bodies providing accommodation to meet special housing needs, including accommodation for victims of domestic violence. A separate figure is not available for expenditure on accommodation for victims of domestic violence. My Department recoups to the local authorities 90% of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs arising in respect of homeless persons including, <Col N="1932"/>where appropriate, victims of domestic violence. The remaining 10% is provided from the revenue resources of the local authorities. Decisions on funding for accommodation of victims of domestic violence, including refuges and transitional accommodation, are matters for the local authority in whose area the accommodation is situated. Associated care costs are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Following are details of the recoupment by my Department to local authorities for the past three years in respect of their current expenditure on accommodation related costs for homeless victims of domestic violence.</P>

	<P>Last June, I approved tender recommendations for the provision of new waste water collection and treatment systems at seven locations in County Tipperary selected by the National Rural Water Monitoring Committee, as a pilot programme, to test a range of new, small-scale waste water collection and treatment systems under Irish conditions. The programme will also test a low cost and low maintenance system to collect, treat and dispose of effluent from existing septic tanks. The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the waste water collection and treatment needs of rural villages and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending the collection systems to households outside the catchment of the new or existing sewerage schemes. The outcome of the pilot programme will inform any review of the level of group sewerage scheme grants.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.</P>
        <P>The Castledermot sewerage scheme was approved for construction under the 2004-06 water services investment programme of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, at an estimated cost of is &euro;7.4 million. The first phase of the scheme, the construction of a waste water treatment plant to serve a population equivalent of 2,400, has been completed at a cost &euro;3.8 million. I approved Kildare County Council&rsquo;s recommendation for the acceptance of a tender of &euro;1.3 million for the sewers and pumping stations in April 2005. I understand that the works are in progress with a view to substantial completion by the end of November 2005. The cost of the archaeological survey was &euro;1.4 million and the findings may appropriately be sought from the local authority.</P>
