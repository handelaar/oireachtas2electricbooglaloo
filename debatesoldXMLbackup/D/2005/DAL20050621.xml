      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I travelled to Luxembourg on 2 June at the invitation of Prime Minister Juncker, who was meeting each of the EU Heads of State or Government in advance of the June European Council meeting, to discuss the EU constitution and the financial perspectives for the period 2007 to 2013. I informed Prime Minister Juncker that we will continue our preparations for a national referendum on the EU constitution and that we looked forward to a full discussion at the European Council meeting where the implications of the outcomes of the French and Dutch referenda were to be assessed.</P>
        <P>On the financial perspectives, we discussed the revised &ldquo;negotiating box&rdquo; which had been circulated by the Presidency just prior to the meeting. I outlined Ireland&rsquo;s position in these negotiations, and emphasised the importance of respecting the October 2002 agreement on the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy. Later in the day, I travelled on to Berlin to deliver a lecture at Humboldt University and also met Chancellor Schr&ouml;der. We discussed the European constitution in the light of the negative outcome of the French and Dutch referendums. We also exchanged views on the financial perspectives and informed each another of our negotiating positions. I met the Prime Minister Mr. Blair on 15 June in advance of the European Council. The discussions at that meeting included current EU issues.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, we will have a full debate on the outcome of the European Council today. I attended the Council in Brussels on 16 and 17 June. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy accompanied me to the European Council. While a broad range of issues on the European agenda was dealt with at the European Council, the key business was that of the European constitution and the financial perspectives. I have arranged for the conclusions of the Council and its declaration on the constitution to be laid before the House.</P>
        <P>I very much regret the outcome of the French and Dutch referendums. We must fully respect the democratic right of the French and Dutch peoples, just as we must respect the decisions of the ten member states that have already ratified the European constitution. I spoke to President Chirac on 3 June and conveyed those sentiments to him.</P>
        <P>It was agreed at the European Council that the ratification process should continue. However, the Council took note of the negative outcome in the French and Dutch referendums and agreed that a period for reflection, clarification and discussion was called for, both in those countries that have ratified the Treaty and in those that have still to do so. It is accepted that the timetable for ratification may be altered in some member states and there is a general understanding that the original target date of 1 November 2006 for entry into force is now almost certainly not tenable.</P>
        <P>The European Council understands that those member states that must hold a referendum before ratification may need a longer and more intense period of reflection, clarification and discussion in the light of the French and Dutch results. Member states that intend holding a referendum should do so when they deem it opportune. It is still the Government&rsquo;s view that the constitution is strongly in Ireland&rsquo;s interest and that of the European Union as a whole. The European Council will assess the situation in the first half of 2006 under the Austrian EU Presidency.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to ratifying the European constitution. Obviously, following the discussion at the European Council, we will not at this stage set a date for the referendum or progressing the Referendum Bill. We will continue to prepare for a referendum. We will use the period of reflection to intensify our engagement with the European constitution and Europe in general.</P>
        <P>The failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives was a further setback for the European Union at a time when it is still coming to terms with the results of the French and Dutch votes on the European constitution. The package put forward by the Presidency would have been good for Ireland and for the Union. Our part<Col N="597"/>icular national concerns were to safeguard the October 2002 agreement on the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, to ensure adequate cohesion arrangements for our regions in transition, to reach agreement on a further PEACE programme and to ensure as fair a deal as possible with regard to our contribution to the EU budget.</P>
        <P>The issue of the British budgetary rebate was one of the main stumbling blocks to reaching a final agreement on the financial perspectives. Following failure to reach agreement, the issue will now be taken forward under the incoming British Presidency and possibly the Austrian Presidency. The European Council will return to this matter. It is important that an agreement on the financial perspectives be achieved sooner rather than later. With regard to the resources available to the National Forum on Europe, I understand the forum is satisfied.</P>
        <P>I advised the House on 18 May on my plans for foreign visits to the end of the year. Since making that statement, one additional visit to Hungary in November has been agreed. This visit is part of the ongoing schedule of bilateral meetings with European heads of Government to discuss EU issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I was disappointed at the outcome of the summit meeting in Brussels. Last year, at the summit of leaders of the EPP, I proposed that all countries requiring to hold a referendum should do so on the same day so that one country&rsquo;s decision would not prejudice another&rsquo;s. Unfortunately, that is what has happened. Arising from that, does the Taoiseach intend to put the Bill dealing with ratification of the EU constitution through the House before the summer recess? Can he confirm that, arising from this debacle, it is not intended to hold a referendum in Ireland, at least this year? The Taoiseach is aware of my party&rsquo;s position regarding the European constitution. There are obviously practical difficulties that must be considered arising from the clear prejudice that exists. People ask why they should vote if the constitution cannot be passed after the French people&rsquo;s decision.</P>
        <P>My second question concerns the fall-out from the budgetary discussion at the summit meeting. Does the Taoiseach agree the attack on the Common Agricultural Policy by the British Prime Minister was simply outrageous and that, as the CAP has been radically reformed on a number of occasions in recent years, the Irish people who voted for an expansion of the European Union did so on the basis of every other farmer having the opportunity to bring themselves up rather than being forced to endure a cutback which will cost Irish farmers dearly? Will the Taoiseach now use what some of the media refer to as his much-vaunted special relationship with the British Prime Minister to contact him directly about this matter? Britain, and particularly the British Prime Minister on the eve of his assumption of the European Presidency, should not have <Col N="598"/>opened up something that was negotiated and overhauled already.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach believe this attack on the CAP by the British Prime Minister puts the European Union in a very much weakened position as a group heading into the next round of the World Trade Organisation talks? Does this not considerably weaken the impact of Europe? Does the Taoiseach agree that it means countries such as China and to a lesser extent India, and some personnel in the United States, will be more than anxious to see a fractured Europe, unable to agree on a budget, unable to agree on a constitution and very much heading in a backward and negative direction?</P>
        <P>This requires cool heads and strong and clear leadership. Unfortunately, there was no evidence of this from the most recent meeting in Brussels. A return to ego trips and national cases will not help build the European process that Jean Monnet spoke of so eloquently many years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will continue to keep the matter of the constitution under review. Deputy Kenny is correct that the referendum will not take place this year. I have made clear that we will publish a White Paper in September. I have made no decision about the Bill but I will consult the Opposition parties before moving on that. It will certainly not be before the summer.</P>
        <P>The position is that the European Council will look at the constitution again during the Austrian Presidency. That period of discussion and reflection will probably take place closer to next summer. However, if the Austrian Chancellor believes it could be after Christmas, it may prove be the case. A number of countries will proceed with a vote while others will continue with a parliamentary ratification process, which will build up the number of states who have dealt with the matter.</P>
        <P>We will see where we are at the beginning of the Austrian Presidency. Some 18, 19 or 20 countries will have dealt with it at that stage. A number of countries will continue with a ratification process. Luxembourg has decided to go ahead with a vote and Poland is likely to do the same from what Prime Minister Marek Belka has said to me. It is important for us not to lose momentum. We should continue on with the European project, explaining the issues and putting forward a White Paper for debate in the autumn. I welcome Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s support for this initiative.</P>
        <P>On the financial perspective, I do not disagree with anything Deputy Kenny said. It is a fair analysis of the situation. Members are aware that I was anxious to meet the Prime Minister Mr. Blair because I knew the position he was taking from the COREPER meeting and from the newspapers I saw last weekend. It is diametrically opposed to our position. I will not fudge on that. I agree with Mr. Blair on many issues and we get on very well but I disagree with him totally on this. He does not accept the position that the <Col N="599"/>rebate should be changed and argues that any negotiations on the rebate should be effectively funded out of totally changing the CAP.</P>
        <P>He is not seeking a modification of the CAP &mdash; I could understand that argument but not accept it &mdash; but a fundamental redraft of the entire budgetary position of the Union. I told him on Wednesday that I did not believe we could do that by Friday night. It was not his stated position a month ago and I do not believe it will be the position in six months&rsquo; time. The entire basis cannot be fundamentally altered. Deputy Kenny correctly noted the changes that arose from the 1992 proposals of the then Irish EU Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry. In Berlin in 1999, significant changes were made to the CAP. In 2002 breaking the link between subsidies and production and moving to a total basis made a fundamental change. I agree with the latter change and, since 1997, I have been on the record in this House as saying that I did not believe the CAP could continue as it was but that a realistic position would have to be taken. I made this point at every meeting I held with the IFA and ICMSA. I have support on this from Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s party.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to express the view, as was done in recent days, that the CAP is old-fashioned, negative for Europe or an organisation for backwoodsmen or that reforms have not taken place. I said at this weekend&rsquo;s meeting that this is a dishonest way to present the issue. Regardless of the rows that take place on reform of the CAP, an agreement is an agreement. The third round agreement reduced the CAP budget to approximately 40% whereas it was over 70% in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1988, I was involved in the first round of negotiations with Mr. MacSharry as Minister for Finance and the<?oasys _jy?>then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Michael<?oasys _jy?>O&rsquo;Kennedy. As Minister for Labour, I addressed the social fund. The CAP then represented approximately 73%. It is now 40% and is likely to decrease further.</P>
        <P>The British position is that the entire matter ought to be totally re-phased and the 2002 agreement and its ensuing restructuring should be disregarded only after which could discussions on the rebate begin. I believe this to be a dishonest presentation because, if the negotiating position of countries such as the UK was that there are no resources for other issues, why did they lead a campaign to limit the scope of the EU budget to 1%? I spelled this out at the March Council meeting of the Irish Presidency. Why stick to a 1% argument before the Commission&rsquo;s proposals are seen?</P>
        <P>There is no logic in this but a debate was not held. The answer at the recent Council meeting was that logic would not be used nor a debate be held and, as agreement would not be reached, we should all go home. I do not accept this position, which represented a bad day&rsquo;s work for Europe. Deputy Kenny is correct, however, in that one <Col N="600"/>has to move on in order to look for a more logical position. It is neither the first nor the last occurrence of such an event, which probably indicates that long meetings are not the best idea, even for European leaders.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept the verdicts of the French and Dutch people in rejecting the draft EU constitution? I am happy to state for the record that I welcomed these verdicts. Does he accept that, if an EU constitution is introduced, it will differ from the current draft constitution because the latter cannot secure the unanimous support of every EU member state? Will he join me in rejecting the view that the EU member states that have not yet voted have been intimidated by the verdicts in France and the Netherlands? An Irish MEP and Member of this House recently expressed this view.</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to clearly explain the motivation for delaying the ratification period beyond November 2006. I would like a clear answer on this. Was it because the verdicts of the people of France and the Netherlands were respected, which implies that the constitution as it stands is, to all intents and purposes, dead in the water? Is it, as many suspect, an exercise to buy further time by placing the draft constitution for Europe in cold storage so it can be resurrected at some future time viewed as more auspicious in terms of the intent of the Taoiseach and others to have it approved? Perhaps the Taoiseach can advise us exactly what is the position as we would like to know. Does the Taoiseach still intend to proceed with a referendum on the draft constitution for Europe already rejected by both the French and Dutch electorates and, if so, when?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered almost all those questions in my opening reply but I will briefly state again that I fully respect the democratic right of the French and Dutch people just as much as I respect the decisions taken by the ten member states that ratified the constitution for Europe. I respect both positions.</P>
        <P>The European Council has made a decision to have a period of reflection, clarification and discussion in all member states during the next 12 months. Analysis is under way in the Netherlands and France to examine the issues. Parliamentary debate is taking place in some countries working towards ratification while other member states have temporarily stalled the process to hold more intensive debate. A referendum will still take place in Poland and Luxembourg. Each country is examining the issues that create problems and difficulties for the Union and seeking ways to explain them and make progress on them.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that it was clearly decided recently there is no possibility of anyone within the European Union renegotiating the draft constitution for Europe. No one will cherry-pick it or remove parts of it and it will remain in <Col N="601"/>its entirety the same document that has already been before parliaments and peoples in many countries. The only reason for the delay is to give more time to member states for the period of reflection, clarification and discussion than was available. What the French or Dutch peoples, Governments, parliaments and administrations will do is a matter for them and not for me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting to hear the Taoiseach discuss how he respects the decisions of others. Does he agree that the best way of respecting those decisions is to recognise that we also agreed to be bound by the rules established? Does he still recognise that the constitution for Europe requires unanimity? On that basis, can he indicate why he believes it is not effectively dead?</P>
        <P>Is he aware &mdash; and I would be surprised if he were not &mdash; that the spokesperson for the French President indicated France will not hold a second referendum? The Dutch Prime Minister stated the Netherlands will not vote again. Does the Taoiseach agree this indicates the constitution for Europe is dead and, if not, what does he know that he may not have already told us? Would it be more honest and upfront to adopt the Swedish position? They will not proceed with a referendum or ratification unless matters change, which is not stalling but stopping.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach now regard the White Paper on the Nice treaty as being slightly inaccurate as it stated that treaty was intimately linked with plans for enlargement and was intended to complete the process? Is it now unclear as to what was meant there, although I took it at face value? If that is the case, has more evolved than was the case at that time?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach stated that ten countries have ratified the treaty but will he recognise that only Spain had a popular referendum? On that basis, would it not be right to re-examine the proposal made by my colleague, Deputy Gormley, at the convention that a referendum should be held in all member states on the same day to reflect the decision of the European Union and all its people as opposed to what is now a failed piecemeal way of going about the process? I accept that was the agreed rule but it may be the wrong rule from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s point of view in that unanimity is needed and it can only be based on everybody voting to accept the convention. If we are to go back to the agreed rule, does the Taoiseach believe Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s proposal has merit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the first question, everybody around the table at the European Council agreed that the constitution remained the valid response to the concerns of citizens and the best available compromise. The situation is difficult because two countries voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; by popular opinion &mdash; the ballots were very high &mdash; but ten other countries, including Spain, voted for the constitution by popular opinion. Another four or five countries are moving ahead with the ratification process and very quickly the number in fav<Col N="602"/>our will be 15. Others have delayed their process, as we are doing here. We will not deal with the Bill before the House. The rule that everybody must agree by unanimity will not change. The only change is the date by which the final decision must be made and then discussed by the European Council. It will not be 1 November 2006, it will be some date after that, perhaps not long after that but it will be a matter for the Presidencies next year to make that determination. There is no point in making it now.</P>
        <P>I know what the French President and Administration have said and I know what the Dutch have said. As the Deputy is aware, they have equally said that they want everyone to continue with the ratification process, but I cannot interpret what they might do in the future. That is a matter for them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the state leaders accepted that the French and Dutch working class were making a very strong statement on the current direction of the European Union in rejecting particularly the rampant neo-liberal economic policy orchestrated by the European Commission, the privatisation of public services and attacks on pension rights and hard-won working conditions by European workers? Does he agree that the rejection by the French and Dutch people was on those fundamental issues and, as such, their attitudes will not be reversed to embrace what has been referred to as the Anglo-Saxon neo-liberal model of profiteering and privatisation?</P>

	<P>Because of that, does the Taoiseach accept it is clear that the proposed constitution is dead in the water? Is that not clear from the failure of the French and Dutch Governments to explain how they intend to proceed in current circumstances, unlike the Taoiseach who, after the rejection of the first Nice referendum, flitted quickly across to Europe to say we will put it to the people again? Does the Taoiseach agree that the rejection and the current position of crisis in the European Union shows that the political and business elite of the EU are divorced from the real problems and concerns of working people? Even the Taoiseach, as President of the EU last year, looked like a man suffering from semi-Napoleonic delusions as he flitted from castle to castle and chateau to palace to get the constitution agreed among the elite.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach stated in the House, when looking forward to the summit, that external affairs would be on the agenda. I asked him through correspondence to raise the freezing of further significant monetary aid to the Pakistani Government in view of the arrest of hundreds of trade unionists &mdash; members of the telecommunications union &mdash; who were fighting privatisation in that country. Did the Taoiseach have an opportunity to raise this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have answered most of the points raised. The Deputy knows he is even out of line with the Socialist Party in France, which had a long debate about the constitution and voted for it. It was the only party that had such an extensive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not the Deputy&rsquo;s kind of socialists, who do not exist anywhere. The Socialist Party in France voted strongly for the constitution following a protracted debate. Unfortunately, the &ldquo;Nos&rdquo; came from the bourgeois and elites in France, who were most opposed to the constitution.</P>

	<P>I am glad Deputy Higgins is associated with such people, which is par for the course. The constitution continues; there will not be any change to it or renegotiation of it.</P>
        <P>The kind of issues to which the Deputy referred in regard to social dialogue were precisely the issues that the convention debated and got into the constitution for the first time. The European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, did a good job. We worked closely with it, making sure the issues of social dialogue, protection for workers and respect for public services were promoted. The work of the Irish Government in this regard was widely acknowledged by ETUC at European level. I am shocked to find the Deputy is so totally out of touch with what was negotiated one year ago.</P>

	<P>On the one serious point made by Deputy Higgins, the Pakistani authorities are reported to have on 13 June detained approximately 300 staff of a Pakistani owned telecommunications company following strike threats. I understand the strike was sparked by the announcement that the Pakistani Government, which owns 88% of the company, planned to sell 26% of the company, a move which trade unions fear will result in large scale job losses in Pakistan. Tensions were reportedly high among the approximately 65,000 people who currently work with the company. After ten days of the strike at the beginning of June, the Pakistani Government and the trade union action committee signed an agreement and believed the matter was completed. However, recent reports indicate that the Pakistani Government has gone ahead and sold the 26% share of the telecommunications company to a telecommunications company in the United Arab Emirates.</P>
        <P>I took up the matter. Acting on our request, the Heads of Mission in Islamabad have agreed to raise the issue with the Pakistani authorities during the biannual human rights <i>d&eacute;marche</i> that will take place in the coming days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said he knew about the British position from the COREPER meeting prior to the Council. When did he learn of the position of the British Prime Minister on the reform of CAP as a <i>quid pro quo</i> in terms of the British rebate? Will the Taoiseach explain the sense of the British Prime Minister being prepared to put so much at risk for a rebate of the order of £1.7 billion sterling, which is not very significant in the context of the British budget? Will the Taoiseach state how he sees the way forward? Is there likely to be progress under the British Presidency, given the double whammy of the failure to agree a budget and the Dutch and French decisions on the constitution? What are the implications for Romania and Bulgaria? Is it intended to proceed with the discussions, due to be initiated in autumn, with the Turkish Government? Is it not being flippant to dismiss out of hand the points of Deputy Joe Higgins on why the electorate in France and the Netherlands did what it did? I refer to, for example, French views on some of these issues regarding the direction of the economy and the opening of discussions with Turkey. Is there any point in not admitting there is an issue there? Does the Taoiseach agree that, in terms of attending meetings around the country, it is alright for us on this side of the House to state there will be no referendum on the constitution prior to a general election in Ireland?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="605"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an analysis in the Netherlands and France of what they perceive to be the main issues. They would rather present the results of that analysis. Obviously Turkey is one of the issues but there is a range of issues. The view of French people whom I trust in the debate is that a coalition of the far-right and far-left came together and in no category did it win. People right across the board voted against the constitution. Having spoken to both sides the number one issue put forward by them was unemployment. Unfortunately that was not in the constitution, as happens in referenda. Reasons numbers two, three, four and five in the analysis were not part of the constitution. In fact none of the six or seven issues identified in the analysis were dealt with in the constitution.</P>
        <P>The Deputy makes a fair point on enlargement. Last night I met the President of Serbia and Montenegro and he is deeply concerned where the commitments lie for them. I was able to reassure him that, despite the difficulties in this European Council, the conclusions of the Thessalon&iacute;ki European Council meeting of June 2003 were restated, namely, that these discussions would take place and that the stabilisation agreements would continue. Hopefully these issues will be finished in the autumn. There is good progress being made in those areas and they are not being abandoned. In spite of the difficulties of last week, work on all of these areas will continue.</P>
        <P>The position on Turkey is now outlined, following events last December. Everyone knows this is going to be a protracted period but I do not see the discussions being deferred or delayed from the present programme. That will continue but it will take considerable time. I said it will be six or seven years before we see the end of those discussions. As the Deputy knows there is much pressure from the Ukraine concerning its position. All of these issues are there and they are of concern to people in many ways.</P>
        <P>The position on the constitution is that it is not all right for people to say there will be no referendum. Sometime in the Austrian Presidency a call will be made on where to move next. At that point 19 or 20 countries might have ratified the constitution. A number of countries are very strong and do not want to stop at all. They will use the period for reflection but they want to move on. Ultimately people want to know what the Netherlands and France will do but that is not going to happen at this stage, if it happens at all. We will have to wait to see what happens. When British Government Ministers come under pressure, they say they will not agree to the rebate until they get a fundamental review of EU funding. That is nothing new &mdash; it has been their standard answer &mdash; and the more pressure that is put on them, the more they maintain that position. Prime Minister Blair repeated that to me last week also. They maintain that the British rebate applies to all expenditure, other than non-agricultural spending in member states. They say that the annual British rebate will average approxi<Col N="606"/>mately &euro;5.5 billion. While this would have increased the UK&rsquo;s net contribution, the UK would by no means be the largest net contributor in <i>per capita</i> terms. The British make that point all the time.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that there is an agreement, signed in 2002, and, despite what the British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw continually says, there was no way out of that. He gave two different quotes about two references, with which nobody else agrees. He has his argument to fight for but none of the others agreed with it. In addition, Mr. Straw does not accept that the 2002 deal effectively meant that by 2013 the EU&rsquo;s CAP for 25 member states would be less than the EU budget for 15 member states. In itself, therefore, it is a major reform.</P>
        <P>Deputy Quinn knows that, as I have said on the record of the House many times, I never expressed the view that the CAP, at 70%, could remain as it was and that we could all go on ignoring it. I had many a row with the IFA and ICMSA on this issue but the reforms were made, thus moving to an entirely different system. Because so much more was saved within the CAP budget of &euro;295 billion, which I realise is a big figure even in today&rsquo;s terms, the Commission would have been able fully to accommodate Romania and Bulgaria. Changed production methods meant that less financial resources would be required and, therefore, there was plenty of capacity for a reduction.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with the British position, which was that they felt money should be spent on other areas. I agree with the British on research and development, training and other areas, but they should not have been so tough about keeping the budget at 1%. Before the British saw the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, they were out fighting the campaign for the 1% club. The British Chancellor, Gordon Brown, said he would not go beyond 1%, but it is somewhat disingenuous to say, a year later, that they will not agree to an extension to 1.06%. The British wanted the whole issue restructured before they would agree to anything.</P>
        <P>On where it goes from now, last weekend&rsquo;s European Council is over and it is not much good for anyone to go on about it. I certainly will not do so after today&rsquo;s report on it. A number of important projects must be taken up, including the financial perspective. While it does not have to be agreed right now, it is important that it is agreed over the next six to nine months. The financial perspective requires, particularly for the new member states, a position of setting in the subheads.</P>
        <P>When the European Union was enlarged from 15 members to 25, nobody believed that when we came to deal with the next financial perspectives, the ten applicant countries would not be fighting for &euro;1 in resources, but asking other member states to stop arguing and move forward. That was the saddest aspect of the summit. Nobody in their wildest dreams ever thought that would hap<Col N="607"/>pen, including myself. In fairness to the new member states, they need decisions to be taken as quickly as possible on the EU financial perspectives so that they can make their own budgetary preparations, including new programmes, subheads and arrangements. The deadline for that is probably in about nine months&rsquo; time, but it is putting pressure on the new member states. Whatever our differences, the last thing we should do is make life difficult for the new member states as they have already introduced significant reform and have enough further reform to implement. They need funding so they can move on. Otherwise it would be very unfair. Whatever else we do, we should assist them and show solidarity.</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that elected Members in this House have major concerns about the EU constitution? The Taoiseach remarked earlier that everybody around the table at the Council meeting was in agreement. That might represent the people at the higher political level, but many citizens throughout the European Union have major concerns about the constitution.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the outcome of the French referendum represents the view across Europe and the view of other people in this House such as myself? Many people have these concerns. It was not just a question of the far left but of a broad coalition in France against the EU constitution, including the broad left and community and trade union groups. They read the constitution, which was a best seller during the debate in France.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach determined to push through this constitution, regardless of the consequences? The impression people are getting is that certain governments are determined to push it through against the wishes of many of their citizens. These are legitimate and democratic concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Parliaments in different parts of Europe are voting 100% or in excess of 95% in favour of the constitution. The politicians in those parliaments have been elected by the people and know their feelings and their moods. If issues such as those mentioned earlier, for example, not extending Europe further, keeping Turkey out or not giving it the opportunity to join, keeping the western Balkans out, or saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Ukraine, represent the Deputy&rsquo;s views &mdash; in line with the views expressed &mdash; I will respect that. He can, ultimately, explain to the people in those countries that this is the way it is.</P>
        <P>I do not share that view. I think countries that have been out of Europe that want to return to it should have the opportunity to be part of it. They are entitled to that. Many of the issues, such as social dialogue and competencies of industries and state companies, are ones that were fought for by the trade unionists of Europe who are happy with them as part of the constitution. By <Col N="608"/>and large, trade unionists throughout Europe supported them. While the Deputy may be against those issues, I do not accept that is a majority view. It is not my view. Ultimately, the Irish people will have the chance to give a view depending on circumstances. I hope we will not find that is their view either.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, was launched in 2001 by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. The strategy is centred on a whole system approach to tackling health in Ireland and goes beyond the traditional concept of health services. It is about developing a system in which best health and social wellbeing are valued and supported. The strategy sets out a blueprint to guide policy makers and service providers in the planning and delivery of health services over a seven to ten-year period. It sets national goals for better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care delivery and high performance.</P>
        <P>There have been many reforms to our health services since the publication of the strategy, most notably the enactment of the Health Act 2004 which transferred responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services to the Health Service Executive. The strategy outlined a number of action points regarding services for older people which the executive continues to implement. The Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have details of the specific services for older people being delivered now to be collated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight a number of developments since the publication of the strategy. Additional revenue funding of approximately &euro;121 million was allocated for services for older people between 2002 and 2004. Some &euro;15.228 million in additional funding has been allocated for services for older people this year. That money is being spent on a variety of services, such as nursing home subventions, home care grants, elder abuse and the home help service. Following the publication of the O&rsquo;Shea report on the nursing home subvention scheme, a working group of all stakeholders was established by the Depart<Col N="609"/>ment to review the scheme&rsquo;s operation and administration. The review was launched in 2003, at the same time as the report of the Department of Social and Family Affairs on the financing of long-term care.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach was established in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. The group is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs this summer. Home care grant schemes have been piloted in a number of areas as an alternative to long-term residential care, to assist older people living at home in the community. Older people being discharged from the acute hospital system and those living in the community are being targeted under the schemes. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive for the scheme this year.</P>
        <P>The ten-point action plan aimed at improving the delivery of accident and emergency services, which was announced by the T&aacute;naiste, is being implemented at present. Additional revenue funding of &euro;70 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive in 2005 for the initiatives, which include measures to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospital beds to a more appropriate setting.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>There are three specific proposals relating to services for older people in the plan. An additional 500 older people will receive intermediate care for up to six weeks in the private sector. Some 100 high-dependency patients will be transferred from acute hospitals to private nursing home care. The home care package scheme will be expanded to support 500 additional older people who have been discharged from the acute hospital sector to their own homes.</P>

	<P>I will remind the Minister of State of the kind of details I was seeking when I tabled this question. I wanted to know how many of the promised 600 additional day hospital beds were provided. It was planned to provide such beds in facilities offering specialist services to those affected by falls, osteoporosis, fractures, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, strokes, heart failure and incontinence. Have the promised 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds been put in place? How many of the planned 7,000 day care places for the elderly have been provided? What has happened to the Government&rsquo;s intention, as outlined in the strategy, to establish 800 places each year in additional extended care and community nursing units? It is not unreasonable, almost four years after the publication of the strategy, to want to know how many of the places <Col N="610"/>in question have been put in place in the health care system.</P>
        <P>What is happening in respect of long-term beds? I tabled a question six months ago looking for information about the number of long-stay beds in public nursing homes under the control of each of the six HSE subdivisions. I learned that the number of such beds is decreasing in each of the subdivisions which bothered to reply. I did not receive a response from some of the subdivisions to my parliamentary question.</P>
        <P>Do I understand correctly from the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply that the Government did not initiate a review of its policy for the care of the elderly until recently, even though such a review was promised in the health strategy? Is it the case that no policy will be in place until the review has been completed? Can the Minister of State explain why just 5% of people in this jurisdiction who suffer strokes have access to rehabilitation beds, according to the Irish Heart Foundation, when 70% of people in Northern Ireland enjoy such access in such circumstances? I would like the Minister of State to tell me why many of the statistics relating to care beds are terrible. We have heard many announcements of what is planned.</P>

        <Quest>the steps she proposes to take to deal with the fact that Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world and, as highlighted by the Pollock report, dangerously inadequate staffing levels for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which fall below internationally accepted norms, as well as the gross underfunding of isolation facilities, which leave patients at risk of cross-infection; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[21025/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen the report that the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned from Dr. Ronnie Pollock. The report confirms that Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world. It reviews existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards and concludes that the services available for such people are not of the required standard. The report includes an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients. It makes recommendations about the numbers and categories of staff which are appropriate for a modern and multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive established a working group following the publication of the report, at the request of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. The working group is reviewing the configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis, in hospitals and in the community. The working group will make recommendations about the reconfiguration, improvement and development of such services. The multidisciplinary working group, which includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland, held its first meeting in early April. I understand that it hopes to complete its work in the next few months.</P>
        <P>The Pollock report is one of a number of reports about cystic fibrosis services being considered by the working group. The working group&rsquo;s endeavours will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland. I will be glad to meet representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and the Health Service Executive to discuss the development and reconfiguration of services for persons with cystic fibrosis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s agreement to meet representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland. They have sought such a meeting for some time, but have been unable to extract a commitment to that effect from the T&aacute;naiste. I look forward to the meeting.</P>
        <P>Having read the Pollock report, does the T&aacute;naiste accept that conditions are so severe and acute that it is not enough to establish a working group to put in place the short-term measures <Col N="612"/>which are needed? She is simply not facing up to her responsibilities in this regard. Dr. Pollock has warned that the conditions in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, which is this country&rsquo;s major cystic fibrosis centre, are so acute that there is a serious risk of cross-infection from virulent organisms. If such an outbreak arises, it might result in litigation similar to that associated with the hepatitis C infection scandal. Such a warning deserves a response from the T&aacute;naiste. She should not hive off her responsibilities in this regard to a working group that might produce a report or a national plan at some point in the future that could be months or years away. We face a serious risk in the meantime. Acute problems such as insufficient staffing, gross overcrowding and a lack of isolation, protection and safeguards are being encountered in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, where most cases of cystic fibrosis are dealt with. What is the T&aacute;naiste doing to relieve such risks and pressures?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have met the CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland as part of my dealings with another group. I would be more than happy to meet other representatives of the association. The Department of Health and Children receives approximately 600 letters, including many invitations, every four days. I assure Deputy McManus that I would be happy to meet representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and any other group. The working group to which I referred in my response was established at the request of the association. Some &euro;300,000 has been made available to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital for minor works. The hospital authorities are making new facilities available. I have allocated over &euro;42 million under this year&rsquo;s capital programme for the purchase of the equipment needed at the new hospital building to which St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital will move as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view on this matter. The working group will need to consider the reconfiguration of services, which are far too disparate at present. Six different areas are covered at the moment. I will not give details of the plans to bring together the facilities currently offered at Beaumont Hospital and Temple Street Children&rsquo;s University Hospital. There is a need for a specific group to sit down to work out how to bring the manpower and facilities together. The &euro;300,000 that has been allocated to St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital will facilitate the appointment of a locum consultant. The working group is anxious for that appointment to be made. While some resources have been made available, I agree that we have to do more. I hope we will see significant improvements at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, which is the national centre in this field, when the new hospital building is in operation and after some further decisions have been made later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister meets the association, will she be in a position to say to the <Col N="613"/>family members of those who suffer from cystic fibrosis that the gross risk of infection is being dealt with, that the provision of care at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital will meet the best standards and within what timeframe? It is very easy to talk about working groups being set up to deal with national plans but commitments need to be made on consultant cover at the hospital. I understand that when the consultant goes on holiday, there is no one to cover the position, which is extraordinary. What timeframe is the Minister talking about in terms of dealing with the acute problems at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital? When can people be secure in the knowledge that their family members will be in safe conditions and will be cared for with sufficient staffing to meet their needs, regardless of the time of year? What timeframe is the Minister talking about?</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the funding for capital projects for acute hospitals she has approved since she took office; the funding for capital projects that is proposed for the remainder of 2005, including projects in Monaghan General Hospital and Cavan General Hospital; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[21185/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will appreciate that, on taking up office at the end of September 2004, the bulk of the capital programme for that year had already been committed. This included prior approvals under the multi-annual health capital programme to progress major developments in the acute hospital sector. In addition, significant investment had already been approved earlier in 2004 in respect of minor capital works in acute hospitals throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, there remained some flexibility in regard to further capital approvals during the latter months of last year. In that time, a number of approvals issued in individual cases that ranged, for example, from &euro;5 million approved for a new integrated imaging management system for St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, to &euro;660,000 for Waterford ambulance station. The health sector drew down all capital funding available in 2004 and funding for capital projects in the acute sector for that year exceeded &euro;320 million.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and <Col N="614"/>personal social services. This includes responsibility for progressing the bulk of the capital programme. Capital funding for the health service is now largely provided through the Health Service Executive in line with the capital investment framework. This amounts to &euro;564 million in 2005, of which in excess of &euro;250 million will be directed towards the acute hospital sector.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have written to the HSE to convey my agreement to allow for the progression of its capital programme in 2005. The capital provision for my Department in the current year amounts to &euro;20 million. This relates directly to funding for a small number of agencies such as BreastCheck, the Health Research Board, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Adoption Board.</P>
        <P>In regard to the two hospitals referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I can confirm that the capital investment programme makes provision for particular works to be advanced during this year. These projects are currently at planning stage and include the upgrade of existing ward accommodation in Monaghan General Hospital and the fit-out of existing space to provide for an additional 25 bed ward and a fourth operating theatre in Cavan General Hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>At this stage, one almost knows off by heart the section in the reply referring to the HSE. It is the standard reply we get to all parliamentary questions submitted on health-related issues.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister recall that in September last year, just before her predecessor, Deputy Martin, left office, following a meeting with representatives of the North Eastern Health Board, he agreed to progress as a matter of urgency a range of measures for Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital? Does she recall also that some, but not all, of the commitments of the Minister, Deputy Martin, were repeated in her reply to a D&aacute;il question from this Deputy on 12 October? I understand some of the commitments have been fulfilled, which is welcome. However, I want to ask the Minister about the outstanding commitments. First, there were to be ten additional day beds at Monaghan General Hospital, which have not materialised. This is a cause of great concern to staff and patients. Why have these extra beds not been delivered? When will they be delivered?</P>
        <P>In a statement following the September meeting, the former Minister, Deputy Martin, promised to provide a CAT scan facility at Monaghan General Hospital. The Minister omitted to mention this in her reply in October. I would like her to address the fact this did not follow through between the departure of the former Minister, Deputy Martin, and her taking up office. What has become of that commitment? When making further inquiries recently in regard to this matter, a staff member stated that the lack of a CAT scan facility is crucifying the hospital. This is the reality with which the staff is dealing. Is the Mini<Col N="615"/>ster aware that an average of six patients per day, and sometimes more, many of them on ventilators, are brought by ambulance or transported by whatever means to Cavan for CAT scans? Nurses must accompany these patients, which means the complement of nurses available at Monaghan General Hospital is severely reduced on a daily basis where there is already a shortage of nursing staff. Will the Minister commit to provide a CAT scan facility, as promised last September?</P>
        <P>Finally, the 19 additional beds at Cavan also committed to, and followed through in the Minister&rsquo;s statement in October, have not been provided. When will that commitment be delivered on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that some of the works at Monaghan General Hospital have been completed, therefore, there is a gap between the approval of funding for capital infrastructure and the use of whatever improvements take place. I must come back to the Deputy on the CAT scan question. There is no CAT scan facility in Dundalk which has a higher number of patients who travel to Drogheda. I do not know whether it is feasible for every hospital in the country to have a CAT scan facility. There are significant revenue implications in terms of staff, including radiographers and others, for a CAT scan facility. I am not in a position to comment on whether a volume of six per day is realistic. Even though it may be difficult and traumatic for the individuals involved, CAT scans are expensive. It is intended that Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals will operate as a single hospital on two sites. Because of the population in the catchment area and other factors, it is not feasible that they can operate totally independently of each other as fully functioning hospitals. There have been many discussions with the Deputy on this matter.</P>
        <P>The commitments made last September and October are being honoured. The capital funding necessary to make these commitments a reality has been put in place. Presumably it is a question of staffing to ensure the 25 beds in Monaghan General Hospital are equipped.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the larger emergency room to operate on a 24 hour, seven day, basis, I understand completion is expected within the next two weeks. I hope this proves to be the case and that it will be operable as soon as possible. For the Minister to make comparisons between the journey from Dundalk to Drogheda with that from Monaghan to Cavan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being brief. One is talking about two different realities for patients on ventilators travelling for CAT scans. The <Col N="616"/>Minister should make no mistake about it, there is absolutely no comparison whatsoever. It is imperative for the patients concerned to have a CAT scan facility. It is worrying that she is advising us that she has no such knowledge of the CAT scan facility proposal. I ask her to re-inform herself of the commitment of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and ensure it is re-affirmed by her and delivered at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>I tabled a parliamentary question on women-centred services at Monaghan General Hospital on 10 May, which was referred to the HSE at some time, but I only received a reply yesterday, six weeks after the question was tabled. Why was there such a delay? Will the Minister answer the part of the question not addressed in the reply I received yesterday, that is, the plans for further development in women-centred services at Monaghan General Hospital, which must include the recommencement of maternity services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The HSE is putting in place a parliamentary affairs division. The functions of the health boards only transferred to the HSE on 15 June. By the autumn, a fully resourced and well functioning division will be in place, which will provide speedy responses to parliamentarians. This was sought and discussed during the passage of the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>Four hospitals are located in Drogheda, Dundalk, Monaghan and Cavan, which is an area with a relatively small population, and two of them do not have CAT scanners. I accept there are issues when people have to travel but the jury is out on whether it is feasible to provide a CAT scan facility, not just the equipment, which costs between &euro;1 million and &euro;2 million, but the staff to ensure it functions properly and the number of patients to use it. I am not in a position to make a commitment nor am I in a position to say that maternity services will be restored at Monaghan General Hospital.</P>

        <Quest>if she will respond to criticisms from nursing home operators that her Department has delayed more than four months in responding to a request for service level agreements for contract beds and that no staff level rules exist for nursing homes even following such high profile cases as Rostrevor and Leas Cross; <Col N="617"/>and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of a service level agreement for the supply of contract beds was raised by representatives of the Irish Nursing Homes Organisation, INHO, at a meeting with me in February 2005. The Department pursued this issue with the HSE and was informed that the INHO had been in discussion with the former Eastern Regional Health Authority for some time on the development of service level agreements in the eastern region. The HSE has confirmed a response has issued to the INHO enclosing a draft service level agreement and addressing the issues raised in this connection by the organisation. The INHO has acknowledged receipt of this response and has undertaken to revert to the HSE on the matter.</P>
        <P>The staff levels for nursing homes are set out in the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993. However, having regard to the level of public concern about the registration and inspection of the nursing home sector, it is imperative immediate action is taken to ensure current systems and processes are as robust as they can be within the context of the current regulations. Responsibility for the inspection and registration of the nursing home sector was assigned to the HSE national care group manager, older people&rsquo;s services, from 15 June 2005. Steps are being taken to evaluate current processes and to agree and oversee the implementation of a national standardised inspection process. A progress report on this review will be available by 5 September 2005. Recommendations arising from this process in respect of the amendment of legislation or regulation will be addressed in consultation with the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The social services inspectorate was established in April 1999, initially on an administrative basis. Regulations to establish the inspectorate on a statutory basis and legislation to extend its remit will be introduced in both Houses later this year. The inspectorate will be charged with the inspection of the public and private nursing home sectors and with the setting of standards against which these homes will be inspected. Establishing the inspectorate on a statutory basis will strengthen its role and will provide it with the necessary independence in the performance of its functions. It will also serve to increase public confidence in State and voluntary social services. Work is in progress in the Department to allow the necessary legislative requirements to be put in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The health authorities have confirmed they wish to close Leas Cross nursing home. Is it not the case the Minister of State, the Department, the former health boards and the HSE knew about the appalling conditions in which elderly people lived in nursing homes but did nothing? Does the Minister of State agree that to allow the most vulnerable people in our society to endure such torture was shameful? <Col N="618"/>Does he further agree his inaction was absolutely shameful?</P>
        <P>Will he confirm 33 nursing homes received adverse inspection reports? Will he name them? Will he take the same action against them as was taken against Leas Cross nursing home? Does he agree a geriatrician must be deployed in these homes and reports and action are needed so that the same scenario does not occur with people suffering? When will the new legislation and regulations be introduced? The Taoiseach made promises and gave undertakings. When will action be taken?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It it totally incorrect to say we did nothing. Communication has been ongoing with the Leas Cross nursing home for some time and while progress was made, it was not happening quickly enough. We took action and sent in a new management team to rectify matters in the home. Unfortunately, it was not possible to provide the necessary changes that would have ensured the patients received appropriate care in the proper environment. In view of that, we decided to take further action and the HSE released a statement yesterday confirming the action we took.</P>
        <P>The system in place for inspecting nursing homes was not functioning properly and did not achieve the desired result. On foot of that, we decided to take further action and will bring forward legislation later this year to put an inspectorate in place, which will cover private and public nursing homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State reply to the question about the 33 nursing homes? Will he name them?

I do not want to depend on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; to tell me in a few weeks that there are other cases, I want the Minister of State to take action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We have taken action and Leas Cross is not the only nursing home in which such action has been taken.

	<P>I certainly will, that is not a problem.

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>her plans and programmes for the provision of services for persons suffering from eating disorders; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that eating disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses, with a 20% mortality rate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the management and treatment of a person with an eating disorder rests with the individual patient&rsquo;s clinician. However, persons presenting with eating disorders are generally treated through the local psychiatric services. Outpatient psychiatric services are provided from a network of hospitals, health centres, day hospitals and day centres. Where inpatient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the local psychiatric unit or hospital, beds being allocated on the basis of patient need at any particular time. A tertiary referral service for eating disorders is available to public patients in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, where three inpatient beds are designated for this purpose.</P>
        <P>An expert group on mental health policy is currently preparing a national policy framework for the further modernisation of the mental health services. The expert group has a number of sub-groups looking at specialist issues in mental health services, including eating disorders. The expert group is expected to report later this year.</P>
        <P>There are three main eating disorders &mdash; anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating. In addition, there is another category of eating disorders not otherwise specified which has a high rate of psychiatric and general medical co-morbidity that often conceals, clinically and statistically, the underlying eating disorder or condition. There is little evidence that anorexia nervosa is increasing but there is a perception that cases are presenting at younger ages, sometimes as early as seven or eight years. It is estimated that there are 80 deaths per annum from eating disorders, that is, approximately 20% of the total number of eating disorders referred to the health services. It is also estimated that 60% of eating disorder patients recover while the remaining 20% partially recover.</P>
        <P>There are three designated specialist beds for the treatment of eating disorders in the public <Col N="620"/>psychiatric service. These are at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Elm Park. There are also two eight bed units in the private sector, one in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital and the other in St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan. Due to the denial aspect of an eating disorder, it has been difficult to orient patients towards early treatment. It is not unusual to encounter first presentations in the accident and emergency department due to some other medical condition. The issue of early detection, therefore, is important.</P>
        <P>There is strong evidence that general practitioners here are ill equipped to deal with eating disorders because of a lack of education in the area. Due to the complexity of eating disorders, inputs are required from many different professional skills delivered by medical, psychological, social work, nursing and dietetic personnel. These can only be provided through full multi-disciplinary teamwork.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. He dealt with many issues I had intended to raise. When will the report on the mental health services be produced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>This year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that 400 people are admitted to hospital each year with eating disorders, does the Minister accept that there should be a specialised service in each regional health service area to deal with this rather than just the three beds in Dublin? The Minister said there are 80 deaths each year or 20% of the eating disorder patients admitted to hospital. That is a significant number of deaths.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister will deal with another matter that has concerned me for some time, which is the eating disorder of obesity and the connection or influence it might have on those who have an eating disorder as outlined by Bodywhys. I congratulate Bodywhys on its work. The messages from the obesity campaign, which are important and correct and which I do not seek to criticise, might have an effect on those who have a starvation disorder such as anorexia nervosa or bulimia. The message being conveyed to the people with those conditions is that eating too much is bad. Should the campaign not focus on having healthy eating habits and attitudes rather than on reducing the amount of food one eats? I am concerned there will be an increase in the number of eating disorders as we know them as a result of the message being conveyed about obesity, which is an important matter in itself. There should be balance in how this is dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the obesity campaign, my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, is doing a great deal of work in the area of health promotion and promoting positive and proper eating habits. Much of that work is done through the schools and that is only right. It is the best place to get the message across to children. If <Col N="621"/>they get the message at that stage, they will have it for the rest of their lives.</P>
        <P>It is a complex matter, as Deputy Neville is well aware, to convey the message of healthy eating while taking account of how that affects people with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. The people we are discussing obviously have psychological and psychiatric problems. I will discuss the matter with my colleague, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, to ensure that everything we do will encourage positive eating and not have the side effect of adding to the problems of the people mentioned. I understand the point made in this regard by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also mentioned the possibility of having eating disorder beds in each of the four HSE areas. That is a good suggestion. It is not acceptable for young people in remote areas, or their parents or guardians, that they should have to travel long distances to get treatment. I will consider that suggestion. However, a sub-group of the expert group is considering this matter and I wish to be guided by that sub-group, as the Deputy would wish to be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 62, 108, 109, 125, 140, 148, 241, 313 and 314 together.</P>
        <P>Prevention and control of hospital acquired infections is a priority for me and for the Health Service Executive. The director of the national hospitals office has engaged external consultants to carry out an independent hygiene audit of every hospital this summer. The results of the audit will be made public and will ensure that the issue of hygiene is taken more seriously by hospitals than has been the case in the past.</P>
        <P>Every hospital will know that the public will have access to the results of the hygiene audit and this will encourage hospitals to perform better to tackle MRSA and help to ensure that the matter is taken seriously. I am not happy with the standard of hygiene in hospitals and it is one of the first things I asked the new national hospitals office to deal with. I am determined that our hospitals are run to the highest possible standards. There is no excuse for low standards when huge money is being spent on cleaning programmes involving both in-house cleaning and outside contracts.</P>
        <P>We need an all out national effort to deal with MRSA. Anything that requires to be done will be done, by way of reporting, getting correct data published and changing practices in hospitals. We will also make money available for public awareness campaigns targeted at people visiting <Col N="623"/>hospitals so they are fully informed about best hygiene practices.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the recent report published by the Irish Patients Association on hospital acquired infections, HAIs. Since 1 January 2004, MRSA is included in the revised schedule of infectious diseases under the infectious diseases regulations. Under these regulations the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, must be notified of persons suffering from any of the diseases set out in the schedule to the regulations. The HPSC also collects data on MRSA bloodstream infection as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system.</P>
        <P>The number of MRSA cases reported in Ireland for 2004 was 553. The provisional figure for the first quarter of 2005 is 145. According to the HPSC, the rates of MRSA observed in Ireland is high and compares with the United Kingdom, France and southern European countries. The lowest rates are seen in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, although those rates are rising.</P>
        <P>A SARI infection control sub-committee has recently updated the national guidelines for the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These guidelines are with the Health Service Executive for finalisation and should be published in the coming weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste find out who is responsible in each hospital for hygiene and cleanliness? What sanctions has the T&aacute;naiste prepared for a hospital that fails in this regard? I am surprised the T&aacute;naiste is carrying out an audit through a UK-based company rather than an Irish-based one.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Does the T&aacute;naiste have the authority to find out what is happening in the 37 acute hospitals under her control? Does she accept that MRSA is fast becoming another litigation nightmare in respect of the health care services because simple protocols have not been followed since 1995 and this will lead to at least 200 cases coming to court in the foreseeable future? Has the T&aacute;naiste received correspondence from the Health Service Executive or an equivalent organisation on MRSA and its presence in hospitals, especially in the past 12 years, and what has gone wrong or what is being done to try to stop it?</P>
        <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste explain why a meat factory or a hotel, which has a significant public health responsibility, is raided by environmental health officers, whereas a hospital is not? Does she see merit in my proposal to set up a flying squad of experts, such as clinical nurses and quality control experts who would raid hospitals, which should be the safest places in the country? A flying <Col N="624"/>squad could carry out an independent audit of hospitals without warning throughout the year.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste referred to septicaemia of MRSA in hospitals but that statistic is not broken down by hospital. It is done at laboratory level. Septicaemia of MRSA is a good indicator of how out of control MRSA is in a hospital. Publishing those figures for each hospital would provide a ready answer as to where the problem lies.</P>
        <P>These are simple questions that have nothing to do with the audit or extra money but with who is responsible and what we can do that will work for the future. Studying markers such as septicaemia will better indicate what is going, or has gone, wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The English company won the contract. We are obliged under public sector recruitment procedures to go to tender. The company has significant experience in this area. The audit will be done during July and August for every hospital and will give us strong base information.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive recently held the first conference of all the persons responsible for cleaning hospitals. The responsibility lies with people at different levels in each hospital. International best practice suggests that when a senior clinician has responsibility for hygiene in the hospital the standards are higher. It may be that a microbiologist should have overall responsibility for hospital hygiene.</P>
        <P>I said recently that when I held my previous portfolio I visited meat factories and other places of work where hygiene standards were much higher than they are in health care. We would not allow food to be produced in the kind of hygiene environment in which patients are treated. That is not acceptable and that is why I have made this matter a priority. I have had many discussions with the national hospitals office on this issue.</P>
        <P>One of the main tasks of the new information and quality authority will be to set standards. We must have standards and enforce them. There is merit in the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion about a hit squad but unless the squad were to do the cleaning it would not achieve much. There is significant variation in what people believe to be the appropriate standards. That is why the conference took place and why the audit is important. As a result, each hospital will be told what is and is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I want to see greater transparency in reporting and I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that this is not done hospital by hospital. I am discussing this with the medical team in the Department and the Health Service Executive. One of the issues that arises is that there is greater laboratory surveillance now than there was in the past. That is not an excuse because it does not give the full answer but it may explain the higher incidence as we now have data which we did not have previously. That, however, does not excuse the fact that there were 105 cases of MRSA in the first quarter of this year.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="625"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that this problem affects not only hospitals but also other institutions such as nursing homes? There is a terrible irony in the fact that teams are sent into workplaces to check whether somebody is puffing a cigarette while MRSA is rampant through the hospital sector. Collecting data and carrying out surveillance does not ensure action on this terrible infection.</P>
        <P>Would the T&aacute;naiste consider extending the powers of the Health and Safety Authority as a simple way to ensure enforcement? MRSA could be made a notifiable disease and the Health and Safety Authority could, if necessary, work with public health doctors to investigate hospitals and nursing homes which are workplaces but where the risk to patients is greater than to staff. Surely the T&aacute;naiste could do this straight away? Providing such a capability to enforce best practice and levy penalties on those who did not comply would transform the situation. Instead of finding out who is in charge in a hospital the T&aacute;naiste could make it clear that there is a requirement on hospitals to meet hygiene standards and if they do not they will incur serious penalties.</P>
        <P>Is the T&aacute;naiste preparing a legal defence against those litigants who are taking legal action with the encouragement of a Government Deputy? What is the Government&rsquo;s position? Will it fight every case?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that if litigation arises it will involve the institutions concerned, namely, hospitals, which have their own insurance policies. The Health and Safety Authority has a specific remit in regard to the health and safety of workers. It does not have the expertise for this job which is a clinical matter. This is not a matter of basic cleanliness, in which we are all expert. One must go behind the scenes to ensure that everything in the hospital is run to the highest standards. The consultancy that won the contract has significant expertise in this area and will provide a good measure of the situation.</P>
        <P>Following the audit, discussions will take place in each hospital to ensure a senior person, hopefully at microbiologist level, will take responsibility for this area. That is already the case in some hospitals.</P>
        <P>Standards will be part of the remit of the health information and quality authority to ensure that patients receive treatment of the highest possible standard, including the hygiene standard. That Bill will come before the House later this year. It is recruiting its chief executive officer and other experts in that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>While some aspects of an investigation into this issue may be complicated, does the T&aacute;naiste recognise that generally the cause or causes are simple? Since taking up office has the T&aacute;naiste, or anybody in the Department of Health and Children, sent a directive or circular to each hospital and nursing home in the country outlining the basic cause or causes of this infec<Col N="626"/>tion and requesting that immediate steps be taken to deal with it?</P>
        <P>I presume the T&aacute;naiste is also aware, notwithstanding the expertise of the consultants &mdash; of whom we have seen many in recent years &mdash; that in the United Kingdom, whence this company comes, there is also a serious problem in regard to this infection. The company may derive its expertise from its experience in the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>Would it be beneficial for the T&aacute;naiste to give readily available information in the House? Dr. Twomey said we could get a reply to most questions a month or two later because they are referred to the Health Service Executive. That is totally unsatisfactory. Previously, when the old health boards still existed, a directive was given instantly and a reply expected within 24 hours.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I said that the HSE is in the process of putting in place a parliamentary affairs division that will be fully resourced. The intention is that, by the autumn of this year, Members of the Oireachtas and others will have very speedy access to responses such as the one that the Deputy seeks from me.</P>
        <P>The earlier part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question concerned what I have done since taking up office regarding hygiene. At my first meeting with Mr. Pat McLoughlin after his appointment as head of the national hospitals office, I raised the matter as a priority issue. I made money available in the Estimates for hygiene related initiatives. Mr. McLoughlin felt that the most appropriate way to proceed was to have a hygiene audit so that we could see the state of play. That had to go to public tender.</P>
        <P>However, that is not the only initiative, since there have been many discussions with individual hospitals and a conference at which those responsible for hygiene have heard what is expected of them, and there will be many more efforts of that nature. Making the information publicly available will in itself act as pressure on those with responsibility in the area to act quickly. I said this in another forum, and I do not mind repeating it here. When the nuns were running the hospitals, they were always spotless.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Simplicity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Some things are basic, but with others one must be in the back office ensuring that everything is run to the highest possible standard, and that is what we intend to ensure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has that instruction been issued?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Only last week I heard of the case of a gentleman who was admitted with a heart attack to an intensive care unit. His son-in-law told me the skylight above his bed was covered with cobwebs. Hygiene simply does not exist in some of our hospitals. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health touched on the point that, in <Col N="627"/>the old days, when we had no money and no Celtic tiger, our hospitals were spotless. Now that we have the money, we have private companies in &mdash; more privatisation, which the T&aacute;naiste favours &mdash; and many hospitals are filthy. I have visited some lately and the problem is simply appalling. The question has once again been asked what action will be taken. Will we continue to rely on private companies to do the cleaning in our hospitals?</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste touched on the appropriate use of antibiotics. What action is taken against general practitioners who simply hand out antibiotics as if they were Smarties, sometimes under pressure from pharmaceutical companies? Many are not at all careful in the way that they hand them out. Can anything be done about such GPs? I stress that many GPs are responsible, but many are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to several of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s responses. Given the seriousness of the MRSA issue and the threat that it poses, will she would consider a proactive campaign? Lives are at risk and it could be hers. What is her opinion on such a campaign of public awareness to encourage co-operation regarding anonymous reporting if it is the preference of the in-patient, out-patient or visitor?</P>
        <P>We must recognise that the appointment of a hygiene standards officer, irrespective of the seniority required to carry weight and make demands, will require 100% co-operation from all who work in or use services at every hospital site if it is to succeed. What is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s position in that regard and concerning the seeking of public participation in outlining what people have witnessed and believed to be negligent? That is the only way that we will ultimately root out the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there will be a proactive campaign, beginning with the hygiene audit during July and August of every hospital in the country. The results will be published and we will also have a public awareness campaign, mainly but not exclusively around the hospitals. I hope that we will also be able to provide for a mechanism whereby people can bring it to the authorities&rsquo; attention if they are unhappy with hygiene standards in a given hospital setting, such as that mentioned by Deputy Gormley. Finally, a senior person in every hospital will have to take responsibility for hygiene. If companies are being paid to perform a cleaning job and are not doing it, other companies will have to be found. It is not good enough and it is not a resource issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

	<P>My apologies. Later this year we will be updating the Medical Practitioners Act 1978. As the Deputy is aware, the medical profession is self-regulated with statutory backing. We will have an opportunity to debate what may <Col N="628"/>or may not happen. If people have specific complaints, it is a matter for the Medical Council. It is not a matter for political intervention regarding clinical decisions. Clinicians have autonomy in our system, as they do in other countries. The Medical Council polices and enforces that.</P>

    <Title>Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Three weeks ago today, on 31 May, we discussed the Leas Cross nursing home and <Col N="629"/>the unacceptable practices that the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; television programme exposed there. Today we read that the Health Service Executive is to move all public patients out of Leas Cross and have the nursing home closed. Such a level of activity on the part of the Health Service Executive since the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme is welcome. However, it cannot disguise the failure of the health authorities to act sooner regarding the home in question. The Eastern Health Board report on Leas Cross of 2 June 2004 &mdash; more than a year ago &mdash; which my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, has obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, makes it clear that a consultant&rsquo;s report on Leas Cross was awaited and that future registration of that nursing home would depend on the findings of that report. The report in question was by Mr. Martin Hynes and was commissioned following the death of Mr. Peter McKenna, who was transferred to Leas Cross from St. Michael&rsquo;s House.</P>
      <P>At Leaders&rsquo; Questions on 1 June, Deputy Rabbitte suggested to the Taoiseach that he should make himself aware of the McKenna case. In a newspaper article on 7 June this year, the following was said about the late Peter McKenna.</P>
      <P LI="1">He&rsquo;d had a recent stroke. He was blind. And he couldn&rsquo;t communicate. The bottom half of his body was blackened as a result of blood poisoning. When he had arrived in Beaumont Hospital earlier that evening they discovered that he was completely dehydrated. Those supposed to be caring for him hadn&rsquo;t even had the wit to see that he was in terrible thirst.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It went on to say:</P>
      <P LI="1">When he died, a fortnight later, the catheter was still there, untended, untreated, uncleaned. Almost certainly, it was the failure to deal properly with the catheter that caused the blood poisoning that brought him to die in pain.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Hynes report was received by the health authorities last autumn? Can he confirm that the draft report raised serious questions about the level of care in Leas Cross and also drew attention to the unusually high number of deaths of patients transferred to that nursing home from a nearby psychiatric facility? Can he confirm that Mr. Hynes&rsquo;s final report is very critical of the way that the health authorities inspected Leas Cross? Will he undertake to publish the Hynes report immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with those issues first. I understand that the report was received by the health authorities last autumn and that it was very critical and raised serious issues. All those points that the Deputy has raised are correct.</P>
      <P>On the first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I repeat the Government&rsquo;s concern at the situation in the Leas Cross nursing home. The nursing home has been monitored by Health Service Executive staff during the last three weeks, as it was in the period prior to that. The primary con<Col N="630"/>cern remains patient safety and the level and standards of care. The HSE has therefore decided to move the public patients and those in receipt of subvention out of Leas Cross nursing home. The executive will consult relatives concerning the movement of patients from the home and will take into account the needs of individual patients. Relatives have their concerns which they have been expressing on the airwaves as well as to the HSE.</P>
      <P>The executive will consult private patients in the home on its concerns regarding patient safety, the overall level of patient care and the need for alternative arrangements. The decision to move the patients has been taken following a detailed assessment by the HSE since the time I last reported to the House on this matter. This detailed assessment of the care situation took place over recent weeks and was carried out by a dedicated team, including a geriatrician. That is why the executive has made this decision and is considering action to take the nursing home off the register.</P>
      <P>While I understand the points made by the Deputy are correct, I cannot answer his question about the publication of the report. We must take legal advice in this regard. The HSE is taking immediate steps to evaluate the current inspection procedures to ensure there will be a national approach to these issues. A review has already commenced in the eastern region and that will be included in the national process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In his Ard-Fheis speech two years ago, the Taoiseach said in respect of those who would put their own interests before the national interest that he would see to it that his Government would use all its power to put the people first. On 1 June, the Taoiseach told the House, &ldquo;the problem in the Leas Cross case was not a lack of inspections&rdquo;. Are we to understand that the nursing home management was notified of inspections to take place? If there were adequate inspections, why did they not uncover the gross incompetence and appalling behaviour at this nursing home? Why did we have to wait for a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report to have this information published nationally? What does the Hynes report say about these inspections?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response in this matter has been to again engage in what has become the mantra for this Government of hand wringing and excuses. Nobody stands up, nobody takes responsibility and nobody is to blame because nobody cares. The complacency and arrogance that have crept into the Government will not wash anymore.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach believes the Government is in a position to look after the elderly and that it wants them, in many cases, to have the facility to stay in their homes rather than be obliged to go to institutions, why is it that in response to a D&aacute;il question in April last year to Deputy Neville, the then Minister for Health and Children said that 8.8 million hours of home help were provided in <Col N="631"/>2003 but the HSE&rsquo;s recent national plan makes it clear that only 6.9 million were provided last year and the same for this year? This is an appalling scandal.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the ship of State he is guiding is holed below the plimsoll line and is sinking fast? This type of ineptitude, incompetence, arrogance and uncaring attitude will ultimately bring about his demise at the hands of the people.</P>

    <?oasys _dc20-?><Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To take an individual case and build from that, as Deputy Kenny is doing, is an unfair way to portray the health system. I will not get into that. As I said previously, there was a procedure of inspection in place at Leas Cross. I have already explained to the House how those inspections were done. I explained that notice was given when inspections were not of a medical or nursing nature but were to do with the governance of the nursing home. However, this was not the case in respect of many of the inspections that took place. The staff at Leas Cross believe the nursing home management was listening to and taking account of what they were saying. The Hynes report was concerned with an individual case.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>Notwithstanding all that, many people in Leas Cross are now upset that the HSE believes they should be moved because it cannot stand over the care issue. This is the right action for the executive to take from a medical point of view and based on a geriatrician&rsquo;s report. I am not qualified or competent to undertake inspections. The HSE has ground rules in place for the conduct of inspections and I am not sure what is the Deputy&rsquo;s point in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach publish the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already said that I do not have any difficulty with the report being published if it is legally permissible to do so, but it is a legal issue.</P>
      <P>I have already pointed out many times, as the T&aacute;naiste has, that the health inspectorate legislation is in place for governing a properly resourced health inspectorate, for both private and general nursing homes. There are significant numbers of patients in both private and public nursing homes who are being well cared for, well monitored and well assessed. The scare tactic of focusing on one case and trying to frighten all elderly people is unacceptable. Where there is a problem, there are competent staff who do their utmost to ensure the highest standards are maintained. That is the way to deal with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to return to the matter of Garda conduct in Donegal and the Carty report which was completed and submitted in July 2000. This was a report by a senior policeman into the <Col N="632"/>awful, appalling, unbelievable and bizarre allegations surrounding the conduct and performance of the Garda in Donegal.</P>
      <P>In November 2001, the Government voted down a joint motion in the name of my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Howlin, and former Deputy Jim Higgins of Fine Gael seeking an inquiry into what was going on in Donegal. Last Friday, we learned from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that the Taoiseach did not have the Carty report. He said the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and he, as Attorney General, did not get the report until January or February 2002. This is the same man who tried to say that Nora Owen and the rainbow coalition were responsible for what happened in Donegal. He now says he and the then Minister did not get the report until the beginning of 2002.</P>
      <P>In February 2001, when Deputy Howlin tabled a question expressly on the Carty report and its findings and what he intended to do with it, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, led him to believe that he had received the Carty report and that, by extension, it did not bear out the character of allegations being made about Garda activities in Donegal. The import of the then Minister&rsquo;s statement meant he not only misled the House but that he communicated, as a result of giving the impression he had the Carty report and was taking no action, that the allegations were baseless or exaggerated. Will the Taoiseach defend the actions of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be a policy of zero tolerance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach say the Minister similarly misled him and the Cabinet at the time, that he had the Carty report in his possession and that it did not bear out the grave character of allegations of abuse and dereliction of duty of the Garda in Donegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know when the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, got the report.</P>

It is impossible for me to do so.</P>

	<P>No answers, that never happened before.</P>

	<P>It is a first that the Taoiseach can think of no defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to try to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Either the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is telling this House an untruth or the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, told this House an untruth regarding a grave matter which goes to the cornerstone of our democracy. I ask the Taoiseach as head of the Government to answer the question. I put it to him that both Ministers are now being untruthful, that the Government possessed the Carty report and that the Government is doing what Deputy Martin when Minister for Education and Science did by dumping on the senior Garda authorities because it needed to provide a fig leaf as to why it resisted an inquiry into Donegal. It had the report, minus the appendices, all along. The appendices comprised the witness statements but the substantial conclusions of the inspector which were submitted to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform bore out the gravity of the allegations with regard to Donegal. As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue sat on it and covered up and used it in this House as and when it suited him. The Government voted down the request from this side of the House for a joint motion on an investigation into the events in Donegal.</P>
      <P>The current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the cheek to allege inside and outside this House and on radio that, somehow, those whose knees were under the Cabinet table of the rainbow Government were responsible. He gets away with this in some sections of the media. It is almost beyond belief that the man who says he did not receive the report until 2002 can say his predecessor in office from 1994 to 1997 was responsible. It is disgraceful. If former Minister for Justice, Ms Nora Owen, was implicated in this manner and the Taoiseach and his colleagues were on this side of the House they would hound her to resign. It is a disgraceful dereliction of duty. The Government did not anticipate that Mr. Justice Morris would get to the bottom of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I am not going to get into the issue. If they did not do so last week, both Ministers are capable of answering the question of when they had the report. I am not going to speculate on that. Deputy Rabbitte knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Reports on the recent High Court judgment concerning the future care of the autistic teenager, Lewis O&rsquo;Carolan, highlighted the intense suffering of his parents, his own difficult position and implications for the parents of other children in similar circumstances. They also highlighted the need for specialised intervention at this stage of Lewis&rsquo;s life. The acuteness of his behavioural problems arose because of the unavailability at an earlier stage of appropriate intervention and training which could have radically modified the severity of his behavioural problems, thereby making life much easier on his parents and him.</P>
      <P>High Court cases have been taken because the State has failed parents in these difficult circumstances. However, the High Court opinion that an offer of a place in the Woodlawn facility in north Dublin was objectively adequate does not meet the urgency of Lewis&rsquo;s situation. Appropriate intervention is needed and is a different matter. The only appropriate facility with the capacity to remediate the earlier inadequate facilities provided in this State is in Bangor, Wales.</P>
      <P>Independent Deputies met the O&rsquo;Carolan family and experts in autism to discuss the situation in depth. Deputy Gregory has assisted the family for a number of years and is well acquainted with the matter. We ask the Taoiseach that the State short circuit the long history of this family&rsquo;s difficulties and make the funding available for Mr. O&rsquo;Carolan to attend the Bangor centre. The family has announced that it and its supporters intend to embark on a fundraising campaign to ensure he attends the centre. It would be obscene for a family in this situation to be forced to travel the highways and byways.</P>
      <P>Last week, I heard in the Committee of Public Accounts that &euro;250,000 per year is required to cater for young offenders in five of the facilities belonging to the Department of Education and Science. These are necessary facilities. However, it would cost less to cater for a child in Bangor. I ask the Taoiseach to step in and determine whether the funding may be provided. Approximately 20 other children with a similar severity of autism could also be assisted. Can the Taoiseach respond positively to this tragic situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to rehearse a court case. Both sides brought evidence before the court and a judgment was made. I was deeply distressed after hearing the O&rsquo;Carolans discuss their son&rsquo;s condition. Everyone would be so affected. I do not doubt that it is extremely painful for the parents to see their autistic children in distress on a daily basis. Every parent wants his <Col N="636"/>or her children to reach their full potential regardless of needs or disabilities.</P>
      <P>As I understand the case, it is regrettable that an agreement acceptable to the O&rsquo;Carolan family was not possible. The professionals involved believed that the care plan proposed by the Woodlawn centre and offered by the State was the best option for Lewis. The court, after considering the multidisciplinary service available at Woodlawn, arrived at the same conclusion and the case has been adjudicated.</P>
      <P>The State proposed that an integrated education and health related support service be made available to Lewis on a residential basis at the Woodlawn centre in Lusk. The centre provides assessment, care, rehabilitation and education for individuals who have learning disabilities or other difficulties including behavioural problems. It currently offers a residential service to young people who range from 14 to 22 years of age. An individual education plan will be drawn up for Lewis to be delivered by a specialist teacher with the support of a special needs assistant and where appropriate, support from nursing staff, care assistants and teachers. Lewis will also have access to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. Staff working with Lewis will receive the support they require through training for their roles and regular review meetings will take place with input from the staff to facilitate the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>I understand the services available in Woodlawn can meet all of Lewis&rsquo;s needs. That was the case put forward by the State in the court case. We have invested significant resources in recent years to improve services for people with special needs. I will not say they are perfect as they constantly need more resources for staff and to achieve best practice, but we improve each year with regard to education, health, residences and staff.</P>
      <P>The State did not seek costs from the O&rsquo;Carolan family despite the fact it won the case as we would rather not be in this position in the first place and it is a pity these issues end up in court. I have more detail on the case, but the outcome of the judgment is that it is genuinely believed Woodlawn can provide the service to the O&rsquo;Carolans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That the High Court awarded costs to the family today underlines the point that this facility only became available or offered at the time of the litigation. Woodlawn is the best option available to the State in the State but it is not the best option available. We must take the evidence of his extraordinarily dedicated parents, the evidence of parents in similar circumstances and those teachers and carers for autistic children who know the situation well. The conclusion they have drawn is that we, the State, should fund this child to go to Bangor for perhaps 18 months for the care they believe would radically transform his life.</P><Col N="637"/>
      <P>We need a national diagnostic and assessment centre for autistic children with extremely challenging behaviour. The Irish Autism Alliance is pro-active in investigating the establishment of a facility similar to Bangor here. It is hoped the State will commit funding to that. I again ask the Taoiseach to examine the human suffering in this situation and the position of those closest to and familiar with it, and in quiet reflection come up with the funding to send this child and others who need similar care to this facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the case Deputy Higgins makes on the needs of the O&rsquo;Carolans&rsquo; son and I am not arguing against that. I do not wish to re-run the court case that has examined this issue and it is a pity these issues end up in court. The amount of assessment, care, rehabilitation, education occupational therapy and speech and language therapy required in this case make it complex. As I outlined, the case put forward by the State for the Woodlawn centre in Lusk is that it has the required staff to carry out on a proper basis the tasks necessary for this and the other cases there.</P>
      <P>The point was made about developing and enhancing the services and examining international experience, and that is why this Government increased resources for disabilities services so much. Deputy Higgins will appreciate this case has gone through it. I understand the staff at Woodlawn, which is part of St. Joseph&rsquo;s intellectual disabilities services, and those putting forward the State&rsquo;s case believe they can help. I join in what the Judge stated in court that it is hoped that Lewis will have an opportunity to use the facilities at Woodlawn and that they will be effective.</P>

      <P>Se&aacute;n held high political office as Minister for State at the Department of Justice from 1979 to 1981, not long after he entered the House. He served as Minister for Justice from March to <Col N="638"/>September 1982 and as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad from November 1989 to January 1992. He also served as a member of Roscommon County Council for a long and distinguished period.</P>
      <P>He was a politician with much experience and was a considerable and able parliamentarian, who was well able to express his point, argue his case and fight the cause of his constituents. He served as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts with distinction and was proud of the role he played, along with other members of the House, in the inquiry into the evasion of DIRT. He was tremendously satisfied by his involvement in that and found it fulfilling work. He, like others in the House, put in a huge amount of effort at that time.</P>
      <P>In 2001 the Oireachtas Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport established a sub-committee under his chairmanship to investigate the costs of the overrun in the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann signalling contract and again he put in a huge amount of effort. That inquiry sat for 235 hours over 26 full sitting days and served a useful purpose until it was abandoned in 2002 when a High Court judgment restricted the scope of all Oireachtas inquiries. Se&aacute;n distinguished himself in the chair of that committee and was proud of that work.</P>
      <P>He was a man of considerable ability and a strong personality. I knew Se&aacute;n for the better part of 30 years. He inspired loyalty in his friends and the support of his constituents. Everyone who knew him in this House would testify that his company and conversation were sought and never dull. Some of the best fun in this House and its precincts was in Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s company. He would fight and argue his case and also knock some good fun out of public life.</P>
      <P>After a promising career in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na he entered politics and enjoyed a career that had its full share of controversy and he was seldom far from the centre of events. He well articulated his take on that. Any politician who reaches a senior position is never removed from controversy. I would like to think that Se&aacute;n will be remembered for his dedicated service, work and achievements as a parliamentarian rather than the controversies with which he brushed.</P>
      <P>In later years, Se&aacute;n was a man of renewed and deep religious belief. His faith was an important part of his life. He gave me lectures on that on a few occasions. Like everyone in public life Se&aacute;n will be subject to the judgment of human history. What really mattered to him, however, was the divine judgment to which he has now been called. Unlike human history, that judgment is not based on a few public events but on a total knowledge that history can never have. Se&aacute;n trusted that it would be a merciful judgment, and I believe he was right.</P>
      <P>I have many fond memories, having travelled with Se&aacute;n and spent the better part of three weeks in Australia with him and some other Members of this House in my earlier years. I will never forget him and the fact that he reminded <Col N="639"/>me that there was another side to life that could have some entertainment, enjoyment and a bit of controversy as well. I pay tribute to Se&aacute;n as a colleague and a friend for 30 years. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On my behalf and on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I join the Taoiseach in expressing our sincere sympathy and condolences to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to Se&aacute;n Doherty&rsquo;s wife, Maura, and to Rachel, Cara, Leah and Evelyn. I was in Washington when I heard of the news of the death of Se&aacute;n Doherty and, unfortunately, was not in a position to attend his funeral.</P>
      <P>I knew Se&aacute;n Doherty throughout his political career, from his entrance through Kildare Street in 1977 until he left this House. In that span I knew him in three different ways &mdash; as an Opposition Deputy, as the chairman of the Western Health Board and as a member of the Opposition when I had the honour of serving as a Minister. By today&rsquo;s standards Se&aacute;n Doherty was a relatively young man. I suppose when one gets into that category or generation, one reflects upon times past, activities in politics and Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s achievements, both in his personal life and in a political sense.</P>
      <P>This is an occasion to pass sympathy to his family and the party to which Se&aacute;n Doherty gave his allegiance. He was a father, husband and friend. During his ministerial career he was central to many of the controversial issues in Irish political life but it is not for me, on an occasion such as this, to pass judgment on the reasons for political decisions or on the trend in politics during that time. Se&aacute;n Doherty was a man of rapier wit and sharp intelligence and somebody who could more than hold his own in any company and in any conversation on a wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>I recall his boyish glee on many occasions when he was chairman of the Western Health Board. He faced many intractable problems dealing with clinics, hospitals, consultants and all the other medical requirements, of which the T&aacute;naiste is well aware, in County Roscommon. When those arguments ended up in a cul-de-sac, he would announce proudly to the meeting that Roscommon also had a Minister of State in the Department of Health, and the hapless Minister of State, the then Deputy Leyden, would be called to the next meeting to account for his failures to deliver on all the promises. Time and again, be it in Castlerea, Ballinasloe, Galway or Castlebar, the Minister of State would arrive to attempt to answer those intractable questions.</P>
      <P>Se&aacute;n was also a member of Roscommon County Council from 1973 to 1991. He was chairman of the health board, chairman of the Midlands Regional Tourism Organisation and a member of the Roscommon Archaeological and Historical Society. He was proud of his achievements on the Committee of Public Accounts. He took a delight in being the inquisitor of many of the people who had to appear before that com<Col N="640"/>mittee and was proud, in a public sense, of the achievements of extracting the truth about many financial issues of the day.</P>
      <P>Se&aacute;n was somebody who could also abide by the rule of politics &mdash; never to agree when one should not. I learned that lesson to my own cost in 1986. As a Minister of State at the then Department of Education I had the privilege of opening the Ballinlough football pitch in Peadar Earley Park where the addresses of welcome were given by all and sundry. The late Se&aacute;n Doherty&rsquo;s speech, given with a twinkle in his eye, was about the disgraceful conduct of the Government in putting rates on GAA buildings, VAT on hurleys and so on. When it was over he said to me, &ldquo;You know yourself. You are in Roscommon and these are my crowd&rdquo;. His crowd returned him repeatedly through the secrecy of the ballot box to represent them and, irrespective of people&rsquo;s views of Se&aacute;n Doherty as a man and as a politician, one cannot argue with the verdict the people gave time and again.</P>
      <P>I offer my sympathy to Maura and to Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s family who are in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. The people who loved Se&aacute;n Doherty supported him for the man they saw him to be and were happy to support him in that context. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam gur ar dheis D&eacute; a bh&eacute;as s&eacute; as seo amach sna Flaithis.</P>

	<P>I was very sorry to learn of the untimely death of Se&aacute;n Doherty. On my behalf and on behalf of the Labour Party, I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny in extending our condolences, in particular to his wife, Maura and to his four daughters.</P>
      <P>It could be said that Se&aacute;n Doherty&rsquo;s political life was a game of two halves. I only played the second half with him and am bound to say that I enjoyed every minute of it. He was a controversial Minister and, as Deputy Kenny said, this is not the occasion to trace the history of that time from which the smoke has not yet entirely cleared and will not for some time. During my experience with him as a colleague in this House and as somebody who served on both inquiries to which the Taoiseach referred, the DIRT and the mini-CTC inquiries, he was a most enjoyable colleague, a most informed and able parliamentarian, immensely quick-witted and humorous and made the long hours tolerable for the rest of us. He was also a very hard working and diligent local Deputy and the affection with which he was held by his local constituents was remarkable.</P>
      <P>I remember occasions such as those to which Deputy Kenny referred. I remember being in Hyde Park at the time Roscommon Hospital first came under pressure. Se&aacute;n Doherty was able to tell the people that since he had access to the Minister of State at the then Department of Health, unlike them he would be glad to use it and he would use it in advocating the case of the hospital. Whatever other implications that might have had, I am sure he did both of these things. <Col N="641"/>On behalf of the Labour Party and myself I again offer our most sincere sympathy to Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s wife, Maura, and her family.</P>

	<P>I, too, join the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny and Deputy Rabbitte in offering my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats to the family of the late Se&aacute;n Doherty, particularly to his wife, Maura, and his four daughters. Se&aacute;n Doherty entered this House in 1977. I came into a different House in these precincts in the same year. He was somebody I knew quite well. We crossed swords on a number of occasions in the early 1980s but he was somebody whose company I enjoyed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The last time I had a long discussion with him, he spoke about his religious beliefs. It was hard to believe I was talking to the same man I used to debate with a number of years earlier. He was often described as &ldquo;born again&rdquo;. While I do not know if that is the appropriate phrase or whether he would wish to be described in those terms, he was passionate about his religion in recent years.</P>
      <P>He probably enjoyed his time on the DIRT inquiry more than any other period in his political life &mdash; he thoroughly enjoyed it. As Deputy Rabbitte acknowledged, he worked extraordinarily hard on that committee. He was proud that his daughter Rachel will continue the political tradition in his family which was very important to him.</P>
      <P>His relationship with Senator Leyden, who is present in the House, was interesting. There are often interesting relationships between constituency colleagues. Theirs was particularly interesting if half the stories I have heard from Roscommon are true, never mind all of them.</P>
      <P>To die at the age of 61, only a few years after he retired from this House, was untimely. I know how much he wanted to enjoy retirement with his wife, Maura, and his family in his native county. I hope he is happy. May he rest in peace. He will be long remembered by many in Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other party leaders in expressing deep sympathy on the death of Se&aacute;n Doherty to his wife, Maura, daughters, Rachel, Cara, Leah and Evelyn, and the Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. I always knew Se&aacute;n Doherty as a real gentleman. I only came to know him after he had come through a number of political storms but, for all that, he was a man who took the lessons of life on the chin and moved on, learned from them and was a better man than many on account of that. He was always good humoured and generous with his time. While I speak from a different political point of view, that did not create a barrier for Se&aacute;n. He was always courteous and one got the impression he definitely did not talk to somebody for any kind of political advantage, but because he respected the humanity of the other person.</P><Col N="642"/>
      <P>This explains much of his popularity. He had an infectious, gregarious spirit that left an air of good humour wherever he went. I got a flavour of this in Carrick-on-Shannon when I was fortunate enough to be part of a cross-party delegation Se&aacute;n led to speak with different community groups affected by flooding on the River Shannon. All along the Shannon, Se&aacute;n held court with the rest of the delegation, meeting different angling, community and residents groups that had been affected by the flooding. However, when it came to Carrick-on-Shannon and his own area of the beautiful region of Roscommon and Leitrim, Se&aacute;n came into his own. He made sure to impress on anybody visiting that if this visit was for work, they should make sure to come back for pleasure, because it was obviously a place they would enjoy on a holiday. I am glad to say I took him up on that advice; I visited the area last year and hope to do so again this year.</P>
      <P>He was a great advocate for his area. That characteristic twinkle in the eye also made him a great advocate for his faith, as the T&aacute;naiste noted. I encountered that passion he had, which he was never shy to discuss. I enjoyed many quite deep theological chats with him. It was something he really enjoyed, as did I. We used to pray together. With that in mind, he has been taken from us at too young an age. However, for some reason, I do not feel the sense that he is in a strange place. I think he is very much at home and embarking still on that path of fulfilment he embarked upon on this earth. I will always remember him as a great family man, a great man of faith and somebody whose company I will genuinely miss.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, I extend our sympathy to the wife and daughters of the late former Deputy, Se&aacute;n Doherty, and to the other members of the Doherty family on their great personal loss. I also extend our sympathy to his friends in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. While I had the opportunity to speak with Se&aacute;n Doherty on a number of occasions, uniquely among those who have spoken here, I was not confronted by his ardent faith &mdash; I can only conclude he must have given up on me before he set upon it.</P>
      <P>The many kind words said of him are true, in my experience of meeting him over the short period of our acquaintance in these corridors. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear the tragic news of the untimely death of my good friend and fellow county man, Se&aacute;n Doherty. I extend my deep sympathy to his wife, Maura, and daughters, Councillor Rachel Doherty, Cara, Leah and Evelyn, and to the extended Doherty family.</P>
      <P>Se&aacute;n Doherty was a political and personal friend of mine for more than 20 years. I had the privilege to serve with him on Roscommon County Council and we were both elected to Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the administrative panel in <Col N="643"/>1989. Se&aacute;n was elected as Cathaoirleach that year. He had served as a D&aacute;il Deputy for Roscommon since 1977. As has been said, during his tenure in the D&aacute;il, Se&aacute;n served as a Minister of State at the Department of Justice and was appointed Minister for Justice, serving until September 1982. In 1992, Se&aacute;n was re-elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and served for a further ten years until his retirement from politics in 2002. I had the privilege of retaining Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the general election of that year.</P>
      <P>Se&aacute;n Doherty was a stalwart in Fianna F&aacute;il. He served the people of Roscommon with distinction. He had an innate ability to politically weigh up any given situation and respond appropriately, with wit and humour and a tremendous turn of phrase that was uplifting for his supporters and unsettling for his opponents. The people of Roscommon will have very fond memories of Se&aacute;n Doherty and all there will miss him sadly. His wife, family and extended family will miss him most. We in the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in County Roscommon miss him greatly. At meetings all through the county in recent weeks, tributes have been paid and meetings adjourned and cancelled in honour of Se&aacute;n Doherty. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It was with shock and sadness that I learned of the untimely death of my former constituency colleague, former Deputy Se&aacute;n Doherty. Se&aacute;n was a political legend in County Roscommon, where he was the last Cabinet Minister from the county. While people will remember many aspects of Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s life &mdash; the Taoiseach outlined his career on the national stage &mdash; many more will remember Se&aacute;n throughout County Roscommon as an effective, efficient and capable constituency Deputy over his long political career.</P>
      <P>This is evidenced by the fact that he is one of only two public representatives, in my recollection, who were re-elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann after losing their seats in County Roscommon. One was Se&aacute;n Doherty, the other was his political adversary and my former colleague, John Connor. Those who knew him personally will remember him for his extreme wit and good humour, as someone who could always see the lighter side of life even when times were difficult in his life and his political career.</P>
      <P>As someone who grew up in a political family, in the political cockpit that was County Roscommon during the 1980s, I knew Se&aacute;n well. Most of all he was someone who idolised his family and he will be an immense loss as a husband, father and grandfather. On my behalf and on behalf of my family and the Fine Gael Party organisation in counties Roscommon, Leitrim, Galway and Longford, the areas he represented over his long political career, I express my sincere sympathy to Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s wife Maura, his daughters Evelyn, Leah, Cara and Rachel and his grandchildren whom he adored, and to the extended Doherty family. May he rest in peace.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="644"/>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I also express my sincere sympathy with Se&aacute;n&rsquo;s wife Maura, his daughters Rachel, Leah, Cara and Evelyn, his brothers Kevin and Colm and his sisters Ann, Maria and Philomena.</P>
      <P>Se&aacute;n Doherty and I stood for election together in 1977 and during that election I probably learned more from him about politics than I have learned since. As times changed and we moved on, we became extremely close friends in political and social life. Over the past three years all of us who sat at the round table inside the door in the restaurant often commented that the wit and sharpness of Se&aacute;n Doherty was missed. It was missed by all his friends and colleagues who sat there on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>When we look back on Se&aacute;n Doherty&rsquo;s career we see someone who served the people of Roscommon and, in his early days, the people of south Leitrim and Roscommon, with unbelievable tenacity. When he got something into his head the idea could not be dislodged. He left his greatest monument when he persuaded a number of us to become actively involved in the Shannon-Erne corridor, which, as far as the people of Roscommon, south Leitrim and Longford are concerned, is the monument to Se&aacute;n Doherty.</P>
      <P>In the passing of Se&aacute;n Doherty a political legend has left the scene. We were all shocked when told that he had suffered a severe stroke. When I heard it I could not believe it. I extend my sincere sympathy, that of my family, and that of the people of south Leitrim, whom he had the honour to represent from 1977 to 1981. I know he is above, having a wry smile at every one of us, saying that they are arguing down there over things of little importance as far as the world is concerned.

	<P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12, 13 and 14 without debate agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not agreed. Concerning this proposal it is entirely wrong as, for example, Votes 28 and 29 are buried in the Estimates. Vote 29 deals with overseas development aid. The Select Committee on Foreign Affairs is confined to considering the Estimates but cannot put the matter to a vote. It is very important for us to have an opportunity to say why we want a vote. On that Vote the reason is that the Government has broken its promise on 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid and no new year has been announced. Concerning Vote 28 the Government has announced &euro;8 million for the Irish Abroad when the Commission on the Irish Abroad made a recommendation of &euro;34 million. I could go on, but all these Estimates amount to a total of &euro;34.764 billion. The nature of the select committee process is that it can consider the Estimates but it cannot call a vote. This is the only place where one can give the reason for calling for a vote on an Estimate and I have given illustrations regarding Votes 28 and 29. For that reason, it is absolutely outrageous that this House could slip away without giving the Revised Estimates due consideration. I have listened to various Government spokespersons referring to the solemn commitment that was given, not only on behalf of the House, but also on behalf of the Irish people, by the Taoiseach at the United Nations in September 2000. It was repeated in the manifestos of both Government parties in the election of 2002, in the programme for Government and in the agreement with the social partners, but it is now being casually cast aside. The Taoiseach has refused to say whether the 0.7% target will be achieved in 2010 or 2015. At the current rate of progress it appears that it will not be achieved before 2028.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We should have good reasons for voting on these Estimates, but I am suggesting there are strong reasons for rejecting at least two of them. The idea that one can rattle through &euro;34.746 billion worth of Estimates without being allowed to ask questions or find reasons to vote yea or nay is absolutely absurd. It is an insult to parliamentary democracy and, therefore, we will be voting against No. 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This proposal is breathtaking. It involves pages of Estimates amounting to billions of euro. I have not had a chance to add up all the Estimates, but essentially the Government is asking us, in an irresponsible way, to give the nod to expenditure without having an opportunity to vote, other than doing so once for the whole col<Col N="647"/>lection of Estimates. The Ceann Comhairle should consider the method of doing this in future because, currently, it indicates that we are here simply to give the nod to whatever the Government may wish to do. I was certainly not elected with that in mind, however, and it is not the mandate I received.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Michael D. Higgins&rsquo;s point. Questions were raised this morning as to why the OPW had rented buildings it never used, effectively flushing &euro;19 million down the toilet. That vast amount, however, pales into insignificance when one considers all these Estimates. It is unacceptable for these Estimates to be taken with one vote and without debate. In committee, there was a limited amount of debate but no vote was taken. This is the only place where we will vote, yet we are being asked to give the nod to all these Estimates in one fell swoop. If we do not like it, we can only vote against all the Estimates together. It is a crude version of parliamentary democracy and we could do much better. I oppose this matter.</P>

	<P>I endorse the remarks of Deputy Michael D. Higgins and Deputy Sargent concerning item No. 12 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper. I object to the approach being taken with regard to these proposals. I wish to speak to No. 13 because Nos. 12, 13 and 14 are grouped together under proposition No. 2. They are to be progressed without debate in the House. We are speaking about the Council decision on the EU action plan against terrorism. While the motion concerns a specific proposal in response to objective 3 of the EU action plan against terrorism, this House has not debated the action plan itself since it was originally adopted almost four years ago, in October 2001. Apparently, the Government has no plans to debate it or any of the approximately 150 measures it contains.</P>
      <P>Regardless of where one stands on the specific proposition or the action plan, this is of such <Col N="648"/>importance that it must be properly debated with full scrutiny and attention being afforded to it in the House. I am speaking not only about No. 13 specifically, but also about a full debate on the content of the action plan, which is long overdue. I appeal to Members to recognise the import of this matter and to reject the proposition to refer No. 13 to a committee where some Members will have the opportunity to debate it away from the full scrutiny of the House and the public gaze. Sadly, that is how business is conducted in committees. We should not fail to afford this measure the necessary scrutiny it undoubtedly requires. I oppose the method of addressing it. I hope the Taoiseach will, either now or in due course, agree to a full debate on the action plan, which is overdue by four years.</P>

	<P>They were dealt with in committee for many hours. On the motion on terrorist offences, I do not have a problem with having a debate on the EU action plan. However, the Council decision on the exchange of information and co-operation concerning terrorist offences was proposed by the European Commission in response to the objective of the action plan. It aims to increase efficiency and the exchange of information concerning terrorist offences between member states, Europol and EuroJust.</P>
      <P>We are asking the House to vote for the decision which provides for the establishment of a designated specialist service within the police services, which will have access to all information on criminal investigations of terrorist offences and can send it to Europol. The exchange of information through Europol is covered by the 1997 Act. No further action is required consequent to the present Council decision. We are referring it to a committee of the House so it is not ending here.</P>

	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 24, statements on the European Council meeting in Brussels, agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 25, Report and Final Stages of the Maritime Safety Bill 2004, agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I tried to raise this matter earlier when the House considered the proposal for dealing with No. 14, the instruction to committee. The Government has tabled many Report Stage amendments to the Maritime Safety Bill 2004. The amendments will provide for a completely <Col N="650"/>new Part 6, emergency legislative provisions to provide for the licensing of vessels and a new section 35, which seems to be directed specifically against the scallop fishermen of Wexford and Waterford.</P>

It has been proposed that the statements will, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 80 minutes.

	<P>I attended the European Council in Brussels on 16 and 17 June. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>The Presidency&rsquo;s conclusions have been laid before the House. The European Council had a challenging agenda. First, it had to deal with the setback to the ratification of the European constitution. While ten countries have approved the constitution, voters in France and the Netherlands rejected it. Second, the Council sought to reach agreement on the future financing of the Union for the years 2007-13. Agreement on the funding package would have given the Union a much-needed political success.</P>
      <P>This was a difficult and, ultimately, very disappointing European Council. At a moment when the EU needed a strong demonstration of solidarity and unity, the European Council had a bad tempered and unproductive negotiation about future funding. The failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives was a further setback for the European Union at a time when it is still coming to terms with the result of the French and Dutch votes on the European constitution. While I do not want to exaggerate the implications of the breakdown in these negotiations, I believe the EU is now facing one of the most challenging periods in its history.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I indicated after the meeting that the outcome was bad but I also indicated my confidence that the European Council and the Union will weather this particular period of turbulence, as it has done many times previously. Member states seek a strong and effective Union and I will devote my efforts to ensuring the earliest resumption of smooth and forward looking business relations.</P>
      <P>While the outcome of last week&rsquo;s Council might not, at first sight, encourage optimism, I believe the Union will find the strength to move forward in a united and determined way. The new member states made an important contribution to the discussions last week. In their interventions, many of the Prime Ministers of the ten states showed a deep understanding of how the EU works and a deep commitment to its future development. Their willingness to compromise and their support for the concept of a Europe based on solidarity was striking and encouraging.</P>
      <P>While the discussions on the future financial perspectives were difficult and robust, the European Council had a positive exchange on the <Col N="664"/>European Constitution. The discussion was serious and amicable and there were no recriminations. There was an overwhelming sense that the European constitution was in Europe&rsquo;s interest and that it should not be renegotiated. The discussion at the Council confirmed there is no plan B and the European constitution remains on the table. The Council adopted a declaration on the European constitution that helps chart the way forward. The Council agreed that the ratification process should continue.</P>
      <P>At the same time, there was an appreciation of the particular situation of the member states committed to holding referendums.. These countries will need more time to engage in debate and dialogue and, therefore, the Council agreed to have a period of reflection and debate in all the member states. It is accepted the timetable for ratification may be altered in a number of member states and there is a general understanding that the original target date of 1 November 2006 for entry into force is almost untenable.</P>
      <P>Each member state will determine, in the light of its own circumstances, how best to proceed. The European Council will assess the situation in the first half of 2006 under the Austrian EU Presidency. The Government remains committed to ratifying the European Constitution. Following the discussion at the European Council, we will not at this stage set a date for the referendum or progressing the referendum Bill. We will, however, continue to prepare for a referendum. We will use the period of reflection to intensify our engagement with the European Constitution and Europe generally.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The National Forum for Europe has done much to promote debate and the Government will continue to support it. It will play a key role in facilitating in Ireland the broad debate envisaged by the European Council. The Oireachtas will also have an important role to play in this debate. The Government will consult the Opposition parties on the scheduling, at an appropriate time, of a full debate in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad on the situation in the EU. In September, the Government&rsquo;s White Paper on the European constitution will be published. This will ensure comprehensive, accurate and factual information is made available to the public. I strongly believe that the ratification of the European constitution remains a valid and important objective for Ireland and for the Union. The pause in the ratification process will allow the governments of the member states to listen to the voters, to communicate the importance of the EU and to revitalise public engagement with Europe and its role in the world.</P>
      <P>The second key issue on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda was the negotiation of the future financial perspectives. In the months preceding the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency managed through great skill and determination to narrow the differences between member states. The package on the table at the Council contained all the elements for an agreement. <Col N="665"/>However, the political will was lacking and no agreement was reached. Ireland&rsquo;s overall approach throughout the negotiations was to ensure the Union is fully equipped to meet the challenges of the years ahead and to enable it to meet the expectations of our citizens. The final package tabled by the Presidency would have been a good result for Ireland and for the Union.</P>
      <P>I indicated at the Council that in the interest of compromise and solidarity, Ireland could have accepted the final proposal of the Presidency. Our particular national concerns were to safeguard the October 2002 agreement on the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, to ensure adequate cohesion arrangements for our regions in transition, to ensure as fair a deal as possible with regard to our contribution to the EU budget, and to secure future EU support for the peace process.</P>
      <P>On the CAP, the Presidency&rsquo;s proposal would have ensured that the funding was sufficient to cover both the commitments made to our farmers under the October 2002 agreement and also the costs of the extension of the CAP to Bulgaria and Romania on their accession. In the discussions on CAP funding at the Council, I emphasised that the October 2002 agreement on CAP funding by the European Council was a milestone. It had resulted in a fundamental overhaul of the CAP and paved the way for a decline in the CAP&rsquo;s share of the overall EU budget. Our farmers accepted the deal on the basis that it had been agreed by the European Council and provided certainty for the years up to 2013.</P>
      <P>Efforts to reopen the deal called the credibility of agreements reached at the European Council into question. Efforts to link the CAP to other issues, such as budget rebates, did not take into account the very far-reaching and significant reforms already made to the CAP. Subsidies have been decoupled from production and the CAP&rsquo;s share of the overall EU budget has significantly reduced over time. The European model of agriculture makes an important contribution economically, socially and environmentally to European society. I regret that many of those, who are perfectly free to take a different view on the future of the CAP than the one I take also feel free simply to ignore the facts.</P>
      <P>The Presidency&rsquo;s final package also included &euro;200 million in support of the peace process over the coming period. The funds would have been spent in Northern Ireland and the Border counties on a range of cross-Border and cross-community projects. The continuing commitment represents both practical and symbolic support by the Union in the cause of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The issue of the British budgetary rebate was one of the main stumbling blocks to reaching a final agreement on the financial perspectives. I strongly argued that the future cost of all rebates should be kept within reasonable limits. Following the failure to reach agreement on the financial perspectives at the Council, the issue will be <Col N="666"/>taken forward under the incoming British EU Presidency and, possibly, the Austrian Presidency in the first half of 2006. The European Council will return to the matter. Ultimately, the EU will find the political will to craft an agreement on the financial perspectives. It is important that such an agreement should be achieved sooner rather than later, not least to allow the new member states the time to prepare for the receipt of Structural and Cohesion funding.</P>
      <P>I made clear, however, that Ireland&rsquo;s acceptance of the Presidency compromise last Friday night was on the basis of agreement at that time. The Government will rigorously resist any attempt to use that compromise as a starting point for further negotiations or a platform for further concessions. While the negotiations on the EU budget are strongly influenced by national interests and objectives, the budget is also a concrete expression of the solidarity and co-operation between the member states, which underpins the Union. It can only be agreed in a spirit of compromise and political goodwill. Short-term national political and economic interests must yield to the collective long-term interest of the future stability and credibility of the Union. We must return to the negotiations determined to reach an agreement which respects the common policies and the earlier agreements of the European Council but which also looks to the future and the global challenges facing the Union.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the European Council reflect the EU&rsquo;s support for future enlargement and to implementing the commitments it has given to accession and applicant states. The European Council welcomed the signing of the accession treaty with Bulgaria and Romania. These countries will participate as active observers in the proceedings of the European Council and its preparatory bodies. Ireland looks forward to their full membership of the Union in January 2007. The European Council also highlighted the need to implement in full the commitments given to Turkey and to Croatia at the December 2004 European Council concerning the opening of their accession negotiations.</P>
      <P>The process of globalisation will not stop while the Union deals with its internal agenda. In the coming months, it is important that the Union continues to focus strongly on economic and social issues. It is clear from the debate in the member states on the European constitution that the challenges of globalisation are now making themselves felt across the Union and at all levels of society. This is why the revitalisation of the Union&rsquo;s Lisbon Agenda, launched in March 2005, must be implemented and pursued with great determination.</P>
      <P>The European Council approved the integrated guidelines for growth and jobs 2005-2008, a key component of the Lisbon strategy. The integrated guidelines must be translated into national reform programmes to be established by member states. The Commission also presented a Lisbon <Col N="667"/>Community programme, which covers all action to be taken at Community level. The national reform programme in Ireland will be developed in response to our specific national needs and the social partners and the Oireachtas will be included in the consultative process in its development.</P>
      <P>In the coming months, the EU must also continue to work hard on dealing with a range of internal issues that affect the daily lives of our people. The fight against crime, terrorism and drugs is an area where strong co-operation between the member states is essential. The Council&rsquo;s conclusions, therefore, noted the adoption of both the Hague programme action plan strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice and the EU drugs action plan. The conclusions also review the implementation of the action plan to fight terrorism and set out the priority actions that must be undertaken in this area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While the European Council was dominated by the discussions on the European constitution and the financial perspectives, it also adopted conclusions on a wide range of external relations issues. The Council&rsquo;s conclusions reflect the key international role being played by the EU, as it works to prevent conflicts, fight poverty and support the effective working of key multilateral bodies. It is essential that, as the Union works to overcome its current internal difficulties, it remains engaged on the international stage and continues to promote its interests and values in a turbulent world. The European Council wants to have a balanced and considered outcome to the September UN summit which will enable the UN to be reformed and to respond more effectively to the threats and challenges facing the world.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the European Council on the UN summit include a new commitment to increase EU overseas development assistance, including a sharp increase in the EU&rsquo;s ODA to Africa. The new EU ODA agreement should result in an additional &euro;20 billion per year in EU ODA by the end of this decade. The conclusions set out the EU&rsquo;s views on a range of key summit issues such as disarmament and non-proliferation, human rights, including the establishment of a human rights council, the reform of the main UN bodies, sustainable development and trade.</P>
      <P>The European Council also adopted important declarations on Kosovo and the Middle East. The declarations reflect the important role the EU plays in regions where international efforts to prevent and resolve conflict are entering into a critical phase.</P>
      <P>The past month has not been good for the European Union. The rejection of the European constitution by two of the founding members of the Union has delivered a shock which will take some time to absorb. We are all still reflecting on the full implications of these votes and will require time to assess how best the Union can move forward. The disagreement on the financial <Col N="668"/>perspectives reflects this state of uncertainty. The launching of a debate on the European constitution and on Europe generally across the Union should help clarify our thoughts and help us to take the necessary decisions to put Europe back on track.</P>
      <P>Now is not a time for division and dispute among us. It is a time for coming together in support of a Europe that serves the interest of all its people in a rapidly changing world. For its part, the Government will support and contribute to the national debate. We will also continue to work with all our EU partners, particularly in the new member states, in a joint effort to ensure that the EU emerges strengthened and revitalised after the setbacks of the past weeks.</P>
      <P>Let me say to those who are now making dire predictions about the future of the EU that I am certain they are wrong. The European Union is not some wilting violet that will fade away overnight. It is a strong plant with deep roots which are nourished by the common prosperity of its peoples, its track record of unprecedented success and by the common desire of its peoples and member states for a Europe united, peaceful, prosperous and free. We must all work together and I intend to play my part in the weeks and months ahead to ensure that we do so.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Last week&rsquo;s summit shows that Europe is going through a storm. However, it is not yet time to take to the lifeboats. The public comments made by Heads of Government during and after the summit were unprecedented in their tone and content. That said, it was the week that saw the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo.</P>
      <P>Naturally, the results of the referendums in France and the Netherlands made ratification the major subject of the summit. However, the budget proved equally fractious. I will address that first. The budget negotiations have been inconclusive, divisive and have left a bitter legacy. Britain did Europe no favours by using the outcome in the referendums to link a deal on the UK rebate with a further scaling back of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. I regard the UK&rsquo;s action as dishonourable. It was an unworthy negotiating tactic and an excellent illustration of why people have become unsure about Europe. They see governments blatantly using Europe for their own domestic ends, regardless of the damage they do to the European ideal in the process.</P>
      <P>In that sense, Britain was out of order. In terms of the CAP, it was equally so. The policy has undergone such radical reform over the last 15 years as to see spending on agriculture as a proportion of EU budget falling dramatically and so-called commodity &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; virtually elimin<Col N="669"/>ated. Further modifications in the context of world trade must be a matter of negotiation, not unilateral attack. It is wrong for a member state to attack the CAP in an attempt to gain leverage on a separate issue.</P>
      <P>It is now said that the imminent UK Presidency of the EU will stagnate. However, that is not inevitable. In fact, the British Government now has an opportunity to repair some of the damage it did last week. If it makes a real and sincere effort to achieve progress on the budget in the context of the constitution, it can prove its critics wrong. It should live up to its duty, its people should be responsible Europeans and the country should build bridges with those member states with whom it has been in dispute.</P>
      <P>In terms of ratification, I am pleased the Heads of Government decided to extend the ratification period. Before the European Council meeting, I joined the summit meeting of the government and opposition leaders of the EPP, which included the Council&rsquo;s current President in office, Jean Claude Juncker, and the Commission President, Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso. There were varying views as to the best way forward. I proposed, as I had previously, that instead of suspending or abandoning ratification, as suggested by the UK, it would be better to keep the process alive and extend the deadline by two years. This would allow for a more comprehensive public debate on the merits of the constitution and a deeper analysis of its rejection in France and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>I note our Government&rsquo;s decision to delay the ratification period. The decision is welcome. I have consistently held the view that proceeding with an early referendum would have been counterproductive, given the practical considerations following the French referendum. It would have been extraordinarily difficult to motivate people disposed to voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, given they would be voting on a treaty which, as things stand, cannot be ratified by all 25 member states. Last year, I proposed that all countries holding referendums on the constitution should do so on the same day to avoid unnecessary prejudice and allow countries to focus on our shared common good.</P>
      <P>Certainly Europe has seen better times. I am confident that it will do so again. In fact, the events of last week illustrate Jean Monnet&rsquo;s belief that &ldquo;Europe is a process, not a product&rdquo;. Politically, co-operation may be at a low ebb. In addition, our people are expressing uncertainty about how exactly they want Europe to proceed. However, I believe this to be part of Monnet&rsquo;s process. It is where politicians get another chance to explain to people the &ldquo;why&rdquo; of Europe, where we can lead a public debate on what it is to be European and, above all, where we can actively listen to our people and their confusion about, or their complete indifference to, Europe and its future.</P>
      <P>Seven out of ten people in the EU say they know little about our Union. Less than half the electorate voted in the European Parliament <Col N="670"/>elections last year. Just after those elections, Romano Prodi warned that we &ldquo;needed to respond to the disenchantment of our citizens&rdquo;. We must do that here and now if Ireland is to show good example in the next part of Monnet&rsquo;s process. The disconnection between the political process and the reality of people&rsquo;s lives is enormous. I believe Ireland can show a good example. It is nothing new. Culturally, in the Dark Ages we colonised the minds of Europe. Centuries later, we used a sliver of silicon to transform ourselves economically from the poor relations into the second richest country in the Union. In doing that we held out hope to others watching, waiting and thinking that if Ireland can do it, so can they. There is no reason we cannot do it again, although this time politically.</P>
      <P>The Irish people are highly sophisticated, educated and intelligent. They have a finely honed sense of doing right by people, standing up for people and of looking out for their fellow human beings. It is that innate sense of responsibility and intrinsic goodness which should form the basis of our debate and allow Ireland to lead the way into the next part of the process in the next two years. This will, perhaps, show that unlike our near neighbours, we are more than a nation of shopkeepers.</P>
      <P>I was struck by a question asked by Edmund Stoiber, who was standing in for Angela Merkel at the meeting I mentioned. It suggested that people do not believe in Europe any more and that there is a necessity to explain to people what Europe is about and why it was formed. He was sitting beside Michael Howard, an Englishman. England and Germany are two of the reasons that the European Union was formed in the first place. These two worthy representatives of their countries made that starkly evident at the meeting.</P>
      <P>It will require new thinking and a new proposition. It must be something beyond the traditionally successful sell of the one-way benefit, the prospect of what is in it for us. Certainly, there is a consumer element to the European ideal. Every time one fills one&rsquo;s car with unleaded petrol, one can thank Europe and its health and environmental regulations. Every time a student goes on a SOCRATES programme to broaden his or her mind and horizons, he or she has Europe to thank. If one has taken parental leave after the birth of a child, one can thank Europe&rsquo;s social chapter. If one is in the 1% of the population with a life-threatening food allergy, packaged food is less of a minefield since Brussels demanded definitive ingredient labelling.</P>
      <P>However, the next stage is about more than that. It is about what we can give as much as about what we can get. With the constitutional treaty, the EU ceases to be an innocuous economic club owned, so to speak, by the governments of the various member states. Instead, the treaty signifies the EU as a political and legal entity, with all the seriousness which that implies. The political dimension of the EU has become <Col N="671"/>increasingly evident in recent years. However, governments, including the Irish Government, have not just failed to address that political dimension, they have positively ignored and avoided it. That is weak leadership and now Europe, and all of us, are paying the price.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about Europe, it is time to be serious and honest with our people. We need to give them debate and discussion on the substance of the new Europe, what it is to be European and on the type of Europe we want, and through that the type of world we want.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there have been mistakes in how projects have been managed. Take the example of the Schengen agreement. Citizens benefit in a tangible way from that ambitious project yet its potential remains unfulfilled. Instead of freeing people, the dismantling of borders causes them to worry about illegal immigration, increased criminality and general insecurity. This is because when they decided to dismantle the borders the EU leaders lacked the political will to step up co-operation between their police forces and judicial authorities. People see the potential but through lack of courage and half-way measures weak leadership results in failure.</P>
      <P>Future analyses should be frank and open. For example, we must examine the role of Europe in a globalised world. Is it to spread stability beyond our borders or to provide safety and cohesion inside? How do we ring-fence the rights and demands of the individual states without thinking how they connect with the needs and the good of the whole?</P>
      <P>It is time to communicate what it means to be European in a way that involves responsibilities as well as rights and relates to the good of the individual state and the greater good of the group. This time last year after the text of the EU constitution was agreed I said the EU was facing its moment of truth, that agreeing the constitution was one matter but adopting it another. That is the case, especially since its defeat in France and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>The next time we vote on an EU issue the question will be whether we are for or against the EU. The response will depend on how politicians here and outside the House engage with, respect, inform and persuade the people in the meantime. This is a golden opportunity to stop selling the EU to the people and explain it instead. We can demystify and humanise the EU and explain its absolute necessity for the 455 million citizens who, thanks to the EU, are neither allies nor enemies but members of the one European family, a remarkable achievement within 60 years.</P>
      <P>Mr. Barroso put it well when he said there was no plan B, but there should be plan D for democracy and dialogue. We have two years within which to explain the reason for existence of the EU and to make people see that its values are theirs, that it comprises people not institutions and that they will build the Union at their pace <Col N="672"/>and their rhythm. This is the only way to make people feel that the EU belongs to them, that it is a place where they have their say, are listened to and is truly their home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Fischer Boel, proposed to the European Council last week that a cut of 4% in each farmer&rsquo;s single farm payment should take place from 2007 as a means of alleviating the looming crisis in the EU budget from that date. It is shocking that the Commissioner charged with defending the rights of farmers and the agriculture sector seeks to undermine the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, agreement less than three years after each member state, including the UK, signed up to it.</P>
      <P>These cuts will come on top of the modulation cuts which will reduce farm payments over the lifetime of the CAP. The single farm payment is not index-linked and will inevitably reduce year on year. Farmers cannot be expected to take a second cut. They have not received the first single farm payment and already there is talk of changing it. The CAP deal, struck in 2002, pledged to preserve agricultural spending at its current level until 2013. This pledge must be fulfilled.</P>
      <P>While the UK tries to squeeze the CAP budget it refuses to examine the terms of its own generous rebate scheme. The UK rebate is worth almost &euro;5 billion annually and has operated since 1984. Mr. Blair appears to ignore the fact that in the intervening period there have been significant reductions and cutbacks in CAP. The level of spending on agriculture in the overall EU budget has fallen by 30% in the past 20 years but the UK rebate level has not fallen.</P>
      <P>The UK and the Commission want the farming community to foot most of the &euro;8 billion bill for incorporating Romania and Bulgaria into the European Union, but that is not acceptable. The UK recently attempted to couch its opposition to the level of subsidies paid to EU farmers in the simplistic terms of its impact on the poor African states. For example, a cut in EU sugar prices would have a negative impact on underdeveloped African countries which gain from the high guaranteed prices they receive for the amount of cane sugar they can sell into Europe.</P>
      <P>Tr&oacute;caire has called for the maintenance of these quotas for underdeveloped African countries and improved market access for them. It also recognises there must be room for domestic production in Europe. Changes to the sugar subsidy regime, however, would benefit big players such as Thailand, Brazil and Australia where sugar production remains in the hands of wealthy ranchers whose incomes increase even more, without return to their peasant workers or to small-scale sugar farmers in the everything but arms countries.</P>
      <P>EU leaders must return to this issue to resolve the budgetary problem soon. I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food to hold firm on the commitment to ensure the CAP will not be <Col N="673"/>further eroded. The EU cannot renege on its deal. The Minister for Agriculture and Food will have her first opportunity to press home this issue later this week when Ms Fischer Boel makes her first visit to Ireland. The Minister needs to hammer home the point that the UK&rsquo;s attempt to revisit the CAP agreement is too late. The deal is closed and cannot be revisited. We must stand firm on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister must also emphasise that farm cuts have gone far enough, particularly when one considers the cuts through modulation funding and that the Commissioner&rsquo;s comments do not help member states to uphold the CAP agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The media have overplayed the outcome of this summit. It would be wise to reflect on what remains in place. Some headlines over the weekend suggested that the Union was finished, that it had failed to agree a budget and a rule book, and that the euro was likely to disappear. There is a rule book, namely, the five treaties. The constitutional treaty was an attempt to consolidate and improve the decision-making process within that rule book, but the French and Dutch have rejected it. The indications are that they will not revisit it in its present form. We must all decide on the way forward.</P>
      <P>There is a budget, and the new budget will not take effect until 2007. There is a set of rules, even if their application in some areas is cumbersome.</P>
      <P>Our friends in Britain are taking on the EU Presidency at a time when the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, could give strong, positive leadership. He is the strongest political leader among those of the four largest countries in the Union. One need only consider the domestic circumstances of Chancellor Schr&ouml;der, President Chirac and Mr. Berlusconi to realise that. Mr. Blair, however, seems to have responded to President Chirac&rsquo;s provocation after the defeat of the constitutional treaty in France to put the rebate back on the table for discussion.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Mr. Juncker, despite his wide experience, should have considered how to handle that aspect of the summit in advance. The expectation that we would get a budget deal was never justified. As the Taoiseach said today, in the early period the 1% club attempted to restrict expenditure but obviously we need to return to Mr. Delors&rsquo; original proposal, when the cohesion funds were created after the Maastricht treaty, and consider 1.44%. We will not achieve many of those things on which Mr. Blair rightly wants us to focus at European level with a small budget, 25 member states and the prospect of two or three more coming in.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was in Mr. Blair&rsquo;s presence at several events organised by the Party of European Socialists where he suggested that he wanted to put Britain at the heart of Europe. Sadly for Europe and Britain and for many people living there, and by extension ourselves, he seems to have lost that opportunity. There is a much better, detailed <Col N="674"/>analysis of this on the opinion page of yesterday&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> by Wolfgang M&uuml;nchau in which he cites four, if not five, downsides to the actions taken by Prime Minister Blair. However, that decision has been taken and we find ourselves in the present position.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, might respond to this. The inference that I draw from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments is that because Britain has such a vested interest in the budgetary process, it is difficult to see it in the role of honest broker and compromise seeker while at the same time maintaining a clearly if not stridently asserted national position. Therefore, we are faced with the prospect of the Austrian Presidency having to sort out the budget at the beginning of next year.</P>
      <P>It is nevertheless sad, since, on the positive side, the European Union, for all the criticism that people throw at it, is one of the few international organisations in the world that people want very passionately to join and that has been an absolute success. Perhaps in retrospect there should have been less pride from Joschka Fischer and a few others and we should have entitled the treaty, as a friend of mine said, &ldquo;A Treaty to Consolidate and Integrate Five Existing Treaties&rdquo; and bore people instead of frightening them by letting them think that we were getting a new constitution. To use the word &ldquo;constitution&rdquo;, as distinct from &ldquo;constitutional treaty&rdquo;, which Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing wanted to do, was, in retrospect, a bridge too far.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach has said. As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, we cannot say to people that they got it wrong. The turnout in the two referenda in the Netherlands and France was double what it was for the first Nice referendum in this country. There was a sustained and substantial debate in both countries. It was extremely well informed about what was in the treaty and showed concern about things that were happening to people.</P>
      <P>We are simply ignoring the elephant in the living room if we ignore the question of Turkey, raised in particular by the right-wing &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign in France but also of major concern to ordinary citizens. It is not that such people are racist or anti-Islamic as such, although some may very well be both, but they are fearful of the future and for their identity.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient to say that to the people who have the reputation for being the most tolerant, the Dutch, who took in economic and religious refugees, starting with the Sephardic Jews in 1492. It was a different kind of Netherlands, but essentially the same region. Antwerp and other places became a haven, first for Huguenots and subsequently for Jews and others. The <i>quid pro quo</i> of that kind of open door policy was that, over time, those generations allowed themselves to be absorbed into Dutch culture and, broadly speaking, took on Dutch values.</P><Col N="675"/>
      <P>What seems to frighten some in the Netherlands is not the first or second generation immigrants who have worked their way up and made a contribution to the economic life of the country. The third generation children of Islamic immigrants seem to be quite fanatical, and there is a similar phenomenon among a minority across the water in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when such things happen, people&rsquo;s fears are real. They are tangible and can be measured. We must understand what is making them fearful. Part of it is globalisation, and part is the failure of two big economies, for totally different reasons, to sustain and generate substantial economic growth. The problems of Germany were caused by the crazy unification proposals and the one-for-one exchange policy of Helmut Kohl. Those in France are quite different, many having been caused by very bad government under President Chirac. As Mr. Sarkozy, the leader of the right-of-centre French party, the UMP, said, a social model that has produced 10% unemployment for the last 20 years is not exactly one that is working terribly well, and that must be examined. To pose that question in his position is to recognise the obvious.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is no question in anything that Tony Blair has said that countries such as Ireland, the Netherlands or Finland, which have reformed their labour markets and introduced change, are attempting to throw the baby out with the bathwater and completely demolish or dismantle the welfare state. Britain now spends more money on its welfare state than ever before, and the sorts of simplistic accusations thrown across about the so-called Anglo-Saxon neo-liberal model being imposed on the European Union simply do not fit the facts. However, the facts are as people perceive them, and therefore what should happen over the next few months and years is a much bigger engagement with what people are concerned about and how their fears can be assuaged.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome has a famous phrase that we have always cited: &ldquo;The peoples of Europe, in creating an ever closer union&rdquo;. We are now reaching the stage where people want to know the final destination and what the Union will look like when it is finished.</P>

	<P>Does it automatically have to roll right up to the Urals? Simply because Ukraine is part of the European continent, is it automatically entitled to be a member? Can we say for a generation, if not two, that the enlargement of ten, and possibly 12, member states is sufficient and will have to be digested and integrated without any further territorial enlargement for a time? I am not talking about five or ten years but a substantial period.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, we must develop our neighbourly policies regarding the countries of the Bal<Col N="676"/>kans which are now surrounded by European Union member states and are, so to speak, within our territorial area. If they are not stabilised, they pose a threat to us, just as a house full of dry rot in the middle of a terrace is a danger to every other house.</P>
      <P>That said, we must begin to reassure and talk to people, telling them what the project is and what sovereign powers we have agreed to share in the EU. That is all that we need for the foreseeable future, and we will not transfer any more powers. We will do the things set out and proposed in the various individual documents to which we have referred and in the existing five treaties, re-encapsulating and restating them in the constitutional treaty itself. I invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to reflect upon that.</P>
      <P>We have some experience in this country from the National Forum on Europe. There is now talk in some other member states and at EU level &mdash; certainly in the European Parliament &mdash; of doing something similar. How that would be structured and presented remains to be seen. However, the need for that communication exists and I commend the work that Senator Maurice Hayes has done with the National Forum on Europe. It is a model at which many other countries are looking to see how it might be applied. We have enjoyed very good value for money from it, since it has provided a non-adversarial platform and a framework within which very diverse views can be expressed, reaching out to civic society and political groups and parties that are either not fully represented or not represented at all in this Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I will return to the budget itself and the question of Common Agricultural Policy reform. The points that have been made by the Taoiseach elsewhere and by Deputy Naughten in the House today are pertinent. It is hard to understand how a country with all the diplomatic experience and wisdom that Britain has shown over many years, having agreed to a deal three years ago, could attempt unilaterally to tear it up in the way it did. A reaction was bound to come from people who, like us, have quite an interest in the matter. I hope Britain understands, as Deputy Naughten and others have said, that the CAP is in any case already reforming itself, being on a downward drift.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are fears in rural Ireland about the implications. One need only read the article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> about the future of the 3,800 sugar beet growers in this country to get a sense of their fear and concerns. It is simplistic to suggest that we should demolish it and have free trade. We must use our negotiating weight in the World Trade Organisation and ensure that Peter Mandelson, on our behalf, seeks structural reform of the relationship between primary agricultural producers and what we can do.</P>
      <P>We must begin to project European values in terms of the World Trade Organisation concessions that we make. For example, the treat<Col N="677"/>ment that Brazilian workers on large sugar plantations must endure is unacceptable. If we want to open up our markets in an attempt to equalise income distribution across the globe, we must start to examine mechanisms that will allow us to exchange one concession for a concession domestically. Either the Brazilian Government moves to improve and enhance basic rights for its workers or else we must find some other way of achieving that end.</P>
      <P>These are issues that must be explored. I have spoken about sugar but the same could apply to many other commodities. If we open up our markets as the neo-conservatives in the United States would like us to do without any type of <i>quid pro quo</i> or without any safeguards in regard to the income distribution effect of that decision, in five to ten years&rsquo; time we will have a totally skewed income distribution derived from the wealth generated by those selling into our markets but no redistribution of any significance in what are currently Third World countries. In such circumstances, there will be a massive reaction in Europe to the point where there may well be a protectionist backlash.</P>
      <P>This has happened before in 1914. We came into the 20th century with an international currency, modern communications, new technologies such as steam and motor transport and a totally open trading system. Within 14 years that open trading system had largely disappeared and only re-emerged to a significant extent at the end of the last century. Protectionism and the reaction to domestic political forces have not gone away and it is vital that we can understand people&rsquo;s fears in this regard. If people agree to trade away, give away or have taken from them certain protections, such as those enjoyed by many rural farm producers in this country, and the consequential effects are not those that were promised, there could be a serious backlash.</P>
      <P>I wish the British Government well during its Presidency. I hope it will take on board some of the comments that have been made and will attempt to prepare the ground if it cannot do a budget deal in the next six months. It should prepare for such a deal for all the reasons the Taoiseach mentioned earlier during Question Time. We must ensure new member states can get access to and draw down funds in their own domestic budgets, limited as such funding may be.</P>

	<P>The conclusions of the Brussels summit were simply a recognition of the reality that the ratification process had to be stalled in light of the French and Dutch rejections of the constitutional treaty. I welcome the thoughtful and measured contribution of Deputy Quinn. He too recognises that we cannot go on as we are. In <Col N="678"/>a statement that was not picked up to any great extent by the media, the Taoiseach remarked before he went to Brussels that the French and Dutch would have to state their position in the same way as he stated his position in Gothenburg after the initial Irish rejection of the Nice treaty. It was in Gothenburg that the Taoiseach announced that Ireland would hold a second referendum on that treaty.</P>
      <P>The question is whether we had clarity in Brussels. Did the French and Dutch tell us they would vote again? If we are to believe some of the public pronouncements, the respective leaders were emphatic that they would not do so. The Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Balkenende, said there would not be a second referendum in the Netherlands. Prior to the referendum defeat, we were told by French leaders that there would be no second vote in France. They were categorical in this contention. The ratification process, with which I did not agree, is therefore stalled and cannot continue.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 2003, I put forward an alternative view at the Convention on the Future of Europe. This submission, which received cross-party support, was a proposal for a Europe-wide referendum. It is ironic that in the light of the French and Dutch rejections, I have heard others who originally dismissed the idea now pronouncing it a good idea that we should all vote together on the same day. It is regrettable that this idea was rejected by the presidium of the Convention because it would have solved many of the problems that have arisen.</P>
      <P>However, it may not have facilitated the passing of the constitutional treaty. I have spoken to colleagues throughout Europe and there is significant opposition. Some German colleagues told me at the weekend that if a referendum had been held in their country, it would have been rejected. The same view seems to prevail in Italy. There may be different reasons for this opposition in different states but the opposition undoubtedly exists.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons the Europe-wide referendum idea was rejected was that many, particularly the French themselves, believed it incomprehensible that France would reject the EU constitution. It was not meant to be like this. The idea was that the French would accept the constitutional treaty and this would facilitate a rolling &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in those countries that held referendums. As one French man observed: &ldquo;If the British say &lsquo;No&rsquo; it is a problem for Britain, but if the French say &lsquo;No&rsquo; it is a problem for Europe.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Part of the reason that the British are now so defensive is the way they have been treated over a period of time. There has been a certain amount of Brit-bashing in this country. Even among Green Party colleagues in other European states I have heard much talk to the effect that the Brits must make up their minds whether they are in or out. What we are seeing now is a reaction from the British. If Europe is a family, we must recognise that we are all in this together, including the <Col N="679"/>British, and that we must take on board their view of Europe.</P>
      <P>The French are slightly out of touch with how Europe has developed. The EU has expanded and the vision of the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs does not necessarily correspond to that of the German-French alliance. It is a slightly different vision in terms of economics. Many of the new member states believe themselves to be, for whatever reason, closer to Boston than Berlin, to use a common analogy. This is particularly so when it comes to militarism because they believe they owe the United States a favour.</P>
      <P>There are a number of issues to consider but it is most important that we decide how to proceed from here. The Laeken Declaration asked us to bring Europe closer to the people. All the evidence suggests we have not succeeded in doing so and that many people are alienated from the European project. What does it mean when the Taoiseach talks about a period of reflection or engagement? Is it a question of engaging properly with citizens or is it a matter of getting the constitution through by hook or by crook?</P>
      <P>There are many who see this debate focusing on the question of the type of Europe its citizens want. Do they want a federal Europe or a confederation? One must accept that not all those French who rejected the constitution were ignoramuses. There was, to use the Taoiseach&rsquo;s phrase, real engagement in France and the constitution was a best seller. I doubt many here would read it. Mr. Dehaene said that nine out of ten people would not read the treaty text but the vast majority of French citizens did so and also read books about the constitution.</P>
      <P>We must decide what type of Europe we want. It is not desirable that we should have a Europe of the elites. I am a supporter of EU enlargement and have always said that Turkey should be part of Europe. I do not want Europe to disintegrate. I do not believe in the histrionics of Mr. Prodi, who said that Europe will disappear because France said no. Europe will not disappear. We will continue, but we must be careful that this process of disintegration, as it is now called, is halted. Some of us want such a confederation, but we want Europe to continue.</P>

      <P>The crisis in the ratification process of the proposed EU constitution was a hot topic of the EU summit. I can only say <i>vive la France</i>. The French and Dutch have taken a courageous stance and expressed their democratic choice. We respect that and hope that other parties do the same, unlike the approach taken by Government parties with regard to the Nice treaty.</P>
      <P>The French and Dutch votes have fatally wounded the constitution. However, it is not yet buried because it contains a clause which allows member states to proceed if the 80% ratification threshold is reached. For that reason, the EU seeks to introduce a longer period of consultation, but that is not required to kill off and bury this constitution.</P>
      <P>While I oppose the constitution, I welcome an opportunity for Irish people to add our weight to the rejections delivered by the French and Dutch and by citizens of other countries. The treaty text is complex and the many reasons which exist for its rejection by Irish, French, Dutch, British, Czechs, Danes and others should be taken into account when EU leaders are forced back to the drawing board. They might, for once, listen. The EU elites and federalists have created this new delay on ratification because they are running scared of the democratic will of the peoples of Europe. One need only look at the arch-federalist and architect of the EU constitution, Mr. Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing. He lamented that the French voters read the document following its distribution to every household. The reality is that, once people in this country educate themselves on the European project, they will reject it in the same manner as the French and Dutch.</P>
      <P>The Government and the people have different desires for the EU. It is our job to prove that a more equal and democratic EU is possible. If the Government is intent on putting a dead duck before the people, we are ready and we will defeat it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is generally accepted that, after the failure to agree on a budget or plans to ratify the constitution at last week&rsquo;s meeting in Brussels, the EU faces its most serious crisis in decades. The delegation which visited the White House yesterday for US-EU talks had the appearance of a lame duck. It is ironic to hear President Bush express US support for a strong Europe, while commentators simultaneously referred to a diminished global role for Europe in the wake of last week&rsquo;s meeting.</P>
      <P>The Council meeting abandoned the attempt to ratify the EU&rsquo;s first constitution by next year without declaring the document dead. This effectively left the EU without a roadmap. It appears to be in suspended animation for the duration of a period of reflection. This period may become permanent if the humiliating defeats of the referenda in France and the Netherlands are repeated. The Luxembourg Prime Minister, Mr. Jean-<Col N="681"/>Claude Juncker, was coldly realistic in saying that the EU could not continue as if nothing had happened. The Prime Minister also remarked that the November 2006 target date for ratification of the constitution by all member states is no longer tenable.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Council apparently did not attribute the failure of the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands to any imperfections in the document but to the electorate&rsquo;s lack of knowledge or understanding. EU President, Mr. Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso, would be well advised not to underestimate the intelligence of the public or its understanding of and concerns about the EU constitution. Since last week France has engaged in recrimination, with the new Prime Minister suggesting that the accession of ten new states in May 2004 was the real reason for the French rejection of the constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the European Council. I want to use this occasion to challenge the cosy consensus that exists in the D&aacute;il on Europe and its future direction. The Government and the major Opposition parties do not listen to the concerns of many citizens. Even if it is not popular to do so, I represent a different view of Europe. I speak as an Irishman and an internationalist in the tradition of Peadar O&rsquo;Donnell and Michael O&rsquo;Riordan. My vision of Europe is one of different nations working together as independent states while respecting the integrity of each. Throughout history, empires have not worked. The attempt to introduce the EU constitution will not work because the voices of citizens were not listened to.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The elites of the EU must be challenged. The result of the French referendum demonstrates that working people will not be bulldozed into a super state with its own constitution, a Union law with primacy over the law of member states, a legal personality and all the symbols of a super-state. The details of the EU constitution in terms of common foreign and security policy are described on page 139 of the constitution. Article III-294 makes it clear that a state is being created that was not sought by the people of Europe.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach and Ministers to look at the evidence of this matter. On 25 February 2005, the German Minister for Europe said that the EU constitution is the birth certificate of the united states of Europe. On 26 June 2004, the Belgian Prime Minister said that the constitution is the capstone of a European federal state. In 1998, the then German Foreign Minister said that creating a single European state, bound by one European constitution, is the decisive task of our time. These comments reinforce my arguments. I urge people to listen to the Opposition voices with regard to the EU constitution.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister confirm that now is a good time for leadership to be shown by major players on the European scene, such as our UK neighbours, as referred to by Deputies Quinn and Naughten? Would it not be welcome that those countries which hold significant responsibilities and play major roles in the European social, political and economic arena should bring forward proposals that demonstrate leadership? By this means, they might dissuade others of the temptation to break with the European tradition and ideal and the vision that led us this far along the European trail. It must be recognised that the European Union has had hiccoughs before, such as that in France prior the Maastricht treaty, but they ultimately resolved themselves.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister use his influence to address the negativity and glee that recently emerged from certain quarters at the possible demise of the European concept? Will he reiterate to all and sundry that this country, with a number of other European countries, including the main ones, has benefited tremendously from membership of the European Union and that the original ideals and goals set by the founding fathers have stood us well and have stood the test of time? The Minister and the Taoiseach have had a positive influence in this area, and the main parties on this side of the House support that. Will the Minister use this influence to pursue those ideals with the objective of achieving similar results to those achieved over the past 50 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a distinct lack of leadership on Friday and Saturday by the main players in the EU and, as the Taoiseach stated, it was a sad occasion. I attended some long sessions, particularly of the Fisheries Council, and it is not often that Ireland returns from a long session without some satisfaction at a fair result, but on this occasion we returned with heavy hearts because of the lack of leadership and statesmanship from some around the table.</P>
      <P>We must be positive. As Deputy Durkan stated, there were crises before and time has shown that the EU is robust and able to get over those issues and hiccoughs. It is true that the negativity in some countries, not least in France and the Netherlands, is accompanied by a large element of dissatisfaction with the economic and employment situation there. However, there was also huge engagement, particularly in France, on the enlargement project and discussions on the constitution for Europe. As democrats we must take the fears of those people into consideration. Just over a year ago we agreed that each member state would endeavour to ratify the constitution for Europe and we believe we are duty bound to attempt it and to take stock at that stage.</P>
      <P>This country has benefited enormously from the European project. The &euro;200 million in peace money was a relatively small addition specifically <Col N="683"/>for this island. It would have continued to give incredible benefit to the six northern and six Border counties, as it has done over the past decade, but unfortunately it is now up in the air. Yesterday I attended a ceremony whereby rural districts from north Louth in my constituency, with districts in south Armagh and east Meath, got together with the aid of EU INTERREG funding under this peace programme to assist rural people who are falling out of the system. If ever a project brought real benefits to ordinary people on both sides of the Border, that did. It makes no sense that those on our island criticise that type of project, which gives real assistance to people not just in one member state but through recognising that the existence of a border causes difficulties in an area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I concur with the Deputy and we will do all in our power as a Government, and we expect the support of those political parties supportive of the European project from the start. We stated to the other member states that they should learn from our experience of the &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Nice referendum and the National Forum on Europe model. During Friday and Saturday, and on Thursday when we discussed the constitution for Europe, we constantly argued that if we were to have a period of reflection it must be a period of engagement and that where a democratic deficit exists in another member state it should use every opportunity to engage with its population. We accept that in a small country like Ireland it is relatively easy to engage with the public. It is more difficult with a population of 60 million, but it should not divert a large country from engaging in real terms with its electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Minister outline the implications for his Department in terms of writing or rewriting the White Paper? I presume the draft in existence before the French and Dutch referenda must be examined in the context of the extended period of engagement and dialogue. While it may not necessarily be in the remit of a conventional or traditional White Paper, some of the mistaken myths that Deputy Finian McGrath put on the record of the House should be confronted. One cannot build a federal super-state with a 1.27% budget or if that so-called super-state is not allowed to borrow money. One cannot claim it will take on all of the manifestations of a super-<?oasys _jy?>state or refer to page 18 of the constitution for Europe and state that the law of the Union will override the law of the member state. That was the position when we joined the EEC in 1973, although many people may not have fully realised it. It makes sense that if one agrees to play a game of international football, everybody must agree to the rules in the first instance and then empower a referee to enforce them. That is what is behind the judgment in the Luxembourg decision, as the Minister is aware.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I could ask many questions. What are the implications, if any, for the publication of the <Col N="684"/>White Paper in terms of addressing some of the concerns that exist? Will the next meeting of the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers be the forum where discussion will take place on the interactive measures, this proactive engagement, or must the Commission bring forward a set of proposals? What is the next move as a consequence of creating this space for reflection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In Deputy Quinn&rsquo;s earlier contribution he asked whether it was anticipated that movement on the financial perspectives would be made during the UK Presidency as opposed to the Austrian Presidency, but we honestly do not know. Tony Blair seemed very content that a decision would not be made during the Luxembourg Presidency. From what he said yesterday, he may well have some plans on this but the general view is that the UK Presidency will have considerable difficulty in acting as an honest broker given that the key issue that must be addressed in the financial perspectives is the UK rebate.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Jean-Claude Juncker said on many occasions during the time we were there that irrespective of the Presidency that will be dealing with the existing financial perspectives, there can be virtually no deviation from the parameters we are currently in and that it was not possible to rewrite the financial perspectives given the dynamic heretofore, not least in respect of the CAP. In respect of the CAP, we made the case that a deal is a deal. Even if the issue was about steel workers in another part of the EU, we must accept that if an agreement is made to which all the member states sign up after much pain, as did the United Kingdom in the guise of Prime Minister Tony Blair, in respect of a period up to 2013, and if we try to get the ordinary people on side &mdash; in this case the farmers &mdash; we cannot turn around and break that agreement. People say there is a democratic deficit in the EU. This would be an example where people could say that after only two years we are going back on a decision. Is it any wonder there might be a perception of cynicism among the electorate in terms of the decisions we make? That is why we stated, on a matter of principle, that as far as we were concerned the CAP arrangement is sacrosanct.</P>
      <P>In respect of arrangements by my Department on the preparation for an eventual referendum, as I said in a different forum earlier today, as a Government we were trying, in consultation with the other like-minded parties, to have all our ducks lined up, so to speak, in such a way that we would be able to make a decision about the timing of the referendum. We published our legislation just before the French referendum, wisely in my opinion. The White Paper is ready for publication but we have decided to delay that and publish it in September, obviously taking on board some of the issues that have arisen in the meantime. Ultimately, we expect there would be a debate in this House on the referendum Bill. We will not bring in the Referendum Commission <Col N="685"/>until such time as we are happy in the knowledge that proper engagement has taken place.</P>
      <P>In terms of the forum that will be used, conclusions issued after the discussion on the constitution of the Council indicated that there was a consensus on the issue of a period of engagement and that we would re-examine that during the Austrian Presidency. I expect it would be primarily at the GAERC meetings, as they are called, but it was also stated specifically in consultation with the other institutions of the EU, not least the Commission which would have a strong role in this area.</P>

	<P>In terms of the constitution, if the Minister was to be consistent with the stance taken here, would it not be right to ask the French and the Dutch, or even the other ten member states, to put the constitution to a vote again? I do not understand the need for a longer and more intense period of reflection, clarification and discussion in light of the results. The Minister said that if we make an agreement we cannot turn around and break that agreement. The agreement was made that ratification would be complete by November of next year. Already, the European Council has broken that agreement. That is the reason there is a perception of cynicism. I do not understand, and perhaps the Minister will enlighten me, why two years is not long enough to discuss this issue. Rather than delaying the inevitable, will the Minister agree that the proper stance to take would be to accelerate the process to enable the issue be put to a vote at an earlier stage? That would give those people who wish to reject it an opportunity to do so quicker and allow us to get on with the next debate rather than debate a dead duck, so to speak.</P>
      <P>What instructions has the Minister or the Taoiseach given to the Referendum Commission on the constitution or has that been put into cold storage also? How does the Minister and his EU colleagues intend to overcome the rejection so far by two countries and perhaps more in the future?</P>

	<P>Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s question on asking the French and Dutch to vote again, we made the point strongly that it was agreed a year ago that every country would endeavour to ratify the constitution over a period and that by 1 November 2006 we would take stock of the situation. No final date was set by which everyone had to ratify the constitution. We said we would take stock of the situation on the ratification process&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P LI="2">(1) To consult widely, with both members of the public, public bodies and non-governmental organisations and, on the basis of its findings, to bring forward proposals for future policing structures and arrangements, with particular regard to the need to ensure that;</P>

      <P LI="3">(<i>f</i>) the legislative and constitutional framework requires the impartial discharge of policing functions and conforms with internationally accepted norms in relation to policing standards; and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>g</i>) the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates within a clear framework of accountability to the law and the community it serves, so that:</P>
      <P LI="4">(i) it is constrained by, accountable to and acts only within the law;</P><Col N="688"/>
      <P LI="4">(ii) its powers and procedures, like the law it enforces, are clearly established and publicly available;</P>

      <P LI="4">(vi) there are means to ensure independent professional scrutiny and inspection of the police service to ensure that proper professional standards are maintained.</P>
      <P LI="2">(2) To complete its consultations and deliberations and to report its findings and recommendations to the Houses of the Oireachtas in as efficient and economical a manner as possible and at the earliest possible date consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it and, in any event, no later than 18 months from the date of its establishment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">I wish to share time with Deputy Costello.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion in my name and that of my Labour Party colleagues, I am struck by the fact that in its 80-year history the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has never been the subject of a root and branch review. The force was formed in circumstances of understandable speed and stealth and its governing legislation, which somewhat post-dates its establishment, did not then or at any time since receive anything remotely approaching normal consideration within the Oireachtas, let alone an input from other stakeholders in civil society.</P>
      <P>Even the most famous of various <i>ad hoc</i> reports, the Conroy report of 1970, was produced by a committee appointed by the Garda Commissioner to report simply on pay and conditions. As Professor Dermot Walsh points out in his 1998 book, <i>The Irish Police</i>, none of the reports of committees and consultants, either collectively or individually, offers a comprehensive analysis of some of the most basic aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na today, namely, its status, structure and management.</P>
      <P>Our first reason for proposing this review is a simple one, it has never been done before. I can think of no other institution so central to the life of the nation and its citizens that has escaped sustained, focused and coherent analysis for so long. <Col N="689"/>It is about time we got around to a structured, participative debate on society&rsquo;s need for policing and on the design of the service we should put in place to deliver on those needs.</P>
      <P>I stress that the debate must be participative, including not just Ministers and public representatives but also the police and those who are policed. In that regard, we make no apology for modelling our proposed terms of reference on those of Patten but also for proposing its methodology &mdash; a structured series of public meetings throughout the State to engage people at neighbourhood level in debating these vital issues.</P>
     <?oasys _dc20-?><P>I am aware this motion will, nonetheless, attract an almost inevitably hostile reaction in some quarters. When a group was appointed in 1996 to review the efficiency and effectiveness of the force, its consultants suggested that the review group should adopt a &ldquo;blank sheet&rdquo; approach to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, along the lines of the Patten commission&rsquo;s work in Northern Ireland. At a conference of Garda chief superintendents, one of the senior members replied by stating:</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P LI="1" FLI="0">This force has too proud a history to be treated in such a manner. It has contributed enormously to the building of this nation and continues to do so.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Until recently, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was one of the few remaining public institutions we criticised at our peril. We could point to wrongdoing, but only as long as we immediately insisted that such breaches were exceptional. If fault was exposed, we were assured &mdash; we repeated the assurance &mdash; it lay at individual level. No-one queried whether such faults had become ingrained or institutionalised.</P>
      <P>In her speech last Friday, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell quoted a statement made in 1922 by the first Commissioner of the Garda, Michael Staines. He said: &ldquo;The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will succeed, not by force of arms or numbers, but by their moral authority as servants of the people.&rdquo; The Labour Party borrowed that saying for the cover page of its document proposing a Garda authority and ombudsman almost five years ago. Commissioner Staines&rsquo;s assertion is important because it highlights a basic point. In a civilised democracy, the most precious asset any police service can have is public confidence in its ability and its integrity. However, in this country that asset is diminishing.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na still attracts a share of public support, respect and even affection, but not as much as it used to and even less as a result of the continuing fall-out from the Morris tribunal. Between 1990 and 1998 there was a 90% increase in complaints against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In 1998, for example, when 1,400 complaints were made against members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, only six were referred to a tribunal. The chairman of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board, Gordon Holmes, stated that public confidence in the Garda is at, or near, an all-time low. He said that, while the majority of garda&iacute; are &ldquo;first class&rdquo;, the public perception is that officers <Col N="690"/>who behave less than honourably are not being adequately investigated and punished. Morale within the force is also, by all accounts, at an all-time low.</P>
      <P>We do the force no favours by conspiring to gloss over these facts. When news emerged of the Commissioner&rsquo;s decision to transfer some garda&iacute; named in the second Morris report to Dublin, analogies were made with the Roman Catholic Church&rsquo;s treatment of abusing priests. The analogy is an apt one because in both institutions there is an aversion to the public gaze and a belief that some things are better kept from public view. The belief is that one only compounds the original wrong by making it known since publication attacks the belief system of what used to be called the &ldquo;simple faithful&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That sort of delusional, self-serving craving for secrecy and cover-up never succeeds and is ultimately utterly destructive of any remaining public inclination towards trust. The reality is that a chronic condition within the force has now become critical. It was once possible to argue for an independent review of policing simply because such occasional reviews are by definition a good thing. It was possible to argue that a commission on policing had been undertaken in Northern Ireland and its proposals not only made sense in the context of that jurisdiction but had intrinsic merit and were worth examining here.</P>
      <P>The situation now is that a review is not just timely but desperately urgent. It is not just a question of copying from the neighbours because what they do seems to work quite well, but of coming to terms with the fact that what we do is not working. As the Minister, Deputy McDowell, put it last Friday: &ldquo;It is a force we all support but it has serious defects exposed in its constitution, its management and its ethics&rdquo;. It is, again according to the Minister, suffering from &ldquo;a collapse of morale and, as Mr. Justice Morris says, a collapse of discipline and accountability structures&rdquo;. That is as good a list as any of the issues to be looked at by an independent commission: defective constitution, management and ethics, and a collapse of morale, discipline and accountability.</P>
      <P>I make no bones about what the principal submission from my party to a commission on policing would be and what I hope that commission&rsquo;s principal recommendation would be, namely, that we need a Garda authority and a Garda ombudsman. This is so for two compelling reasons. The first is to secure real and effective accountability from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, something the Minister and his predecessors have signally failed to do. The second is to protect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from political interference and permit the genuinely independent investigation of legitimate complaints against garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>There is plenty of other material for a commission to consider, much of it for the first time. The Minister told us last Friday he had provided the force with a proper written constitution for the first time in 80 years, which he called a &ldquo;new charter of accountability and responsibility&rdquo;. Let <Col N="691"/>us consider his charter. First, for all his repeated and insistent references to the issue, the Minister&rsquo;s Bill says absolutely nothing about the security and intelligence aspects of the force&rsquo;s remit &mdash; are these too secret to legislate for? I had some words to say in this regard last Friday. Second, although most people would consider it to be a defining characteristic of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this constitutional charter has nothing to say about its unarmed status. The Minister could, under the Bill, direct the Commissioner to arm every garda on the beat. Although the House could deplore that directive, there is nothing in law it could do to defeat it. So much for accountability to the D&aacute;il. Third, there is nothing in the Bill on even basic and long-standing structures within the force such as, for example, the division between uniformed police and detectives. Fourth, most fundamental of all, the Bill is silent as to the status in law of the individual members of the force.</P>
      <P>Why does the Minister insist in section 41 that the State will be liable for wrongs done by individual members only in performing their functions under this Bill and not their functions under other Acts or at common law? This question is particularly pertinent given that this Bill does not confer functions on individual members. Why does he insist that the statement in section 7, outlining the functions of the force, has no effect on the powers, immunities, privileges and duties that individual members of the force have under all those other Acts and at common law? He must know that an important and outstanding legal issue, dealt with in some detail by Dermot Walsh but still unresolved, is the extent to which garda&iacute; can consider themselves to be independent office holders &mdash; peace officers rather than employees of the force or of the State.</P>
      <P>This issue goes to the heart of the debate about the duty of garda&iacute; to account to their superiors. If garda&iacute; are, even occasionally, independent office holders, how can they be directed as to what to do or called to account for how they do it? Yet, the Bill seeks to preserve this arcane common law status of peace officer rather than to rationalise it.</P>
      <P>There is plenty of material for a commission on policing, well before one proceeds to issues of interaction with and accountability to the community. However, I will return to our central submission, the proposal for a Garda authority and a Garda ombudsman. By an ombudsman, I mean an individual with independence, capacity and resources to react swiftly and intervene immediately &mdash; to be able to react, if need be, to the lunchtime news and to descend on or preserve a scene. One cannot, with the best will in the world, find that capacity in a committee. Nor can one clearly identify where responsibility is reposed.</P>
            <?oasys _dc20-?><P>When the Minister was asked why he still insists the commission must be multi-member, his reply insulted the intelligence of his audience: there had to be cover for the holidays. His answer was absurd, both at policy level and the level of mechanics. A <Col N="692"/>simple tweaking of the power to delegate, which is already provided for in the Bill, would enable temporary absences to be covered. It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that those who framed this legislation want a Garda ombudsman commission that will proceed at a deliberate and cautious pace because they want to be able, quite literally, to keep ahead of the posse.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      
      <P>The reason we need real and effective Garda accountability is because the force and its members possess extraordinary powers over the rest of us and those powers can be and are abused. There are circles in which that simple proposition is not accepted. There are those who would be happy enough to let the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at it. They believe that most garda&iacute;, most of the time, exercise their powers for the common good. They believe that, quite frankly, when garda&iacute; abuse their powers their victims are mostly the sort of people who had it coming to them. We should not, as the Taoiseach would put it, get &ldquo;weak kneed&rdquo; if the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cut a few corners, so long as they are generally on the right track.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that approach, particularly when it comes with the sort of macho posturing the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea likes to specialise in, but for which he is so spectacularly unsuited. That Minister described as &ldquo;weak&rdquo;, &ldquo;mealy-mouthed&rdquo; and &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; a statement by Deputy Joe Costello following the shooting dead of two attempted robbers in Lusk last month. What Deputy Costello said was that &ldquo;where people die as a result of Garda action, there must be proper procedures for an independent investigation into such incidents&rdquo;. The fact that Deputy Costello was quoting almost verbatim from a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which is binding on the Irish courts, was neither here nor there so far as the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, was concerned. The notion that the same rules of law must apply in Lusk as in Loughall or in Gibraltar seems to mean nothing at all to him when there is a column to be written or a space to be filled.</P>
      <P>Garda powers have been abused in the past and they will undoubtedly be abused in future. That is an inevitable fact of life, not just because it happens in every walk of life but because it is particularly likely to happen in this walk of life where the stakes are high and the playing field is not level. The temptation is to red-circle cases like the Birmingham Six or the fallout from the Sallins mail robbery, including the Nicky Kelly case, as momentary lapses from a generally high standard. After all, the Kelly case occurred when there was a &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; operating within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It operated not just outside the regular structures of the force but outside and in direct breach of the law. Before one writes off the heavy gang as only of historical interest, let us see what connections in personnel and methodology have led to more than one recent, infamous, retracted confession being obtained in Garda custody.</P><Col N="693"/>
      <P>Questioning in Garda custody is of its nature both secret and compulsory. These two factors create an environment in which the suspect can become a subject of oppression and can be induced to make a statement. Over 100 years ago a judge used straightforward language to put the issue in perspective. Justice Cave in <i>R. v Thompson</i> (1883) said:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is remarkable that it is of very rare occurrence for evidence of a confession to be given when proof of prisoner&rsquo;s guilt is otherwise clear and satisfactory; but when it is not clear and satisfactory the prisoner is not infrequently alleged to have been seized with the desire, born of penitence and remorse, to supplement it with a confession; and this desire itself again vanishes as soon as he appears in a court of justice.</P>
      <P FLI="0">More than a century later we had the case of Dean Lyons, who was accused of the brutal murder of two patients in Grangegorman in 1997, taken to the Bridewell, placed in a video and tape-recording suite and interviewed. In that interview, he admitted to every charge put to him. The transcript shows that he was confused and incoherent. He suffered from learning difficulties at school, feared authority figures and had a habit of confessing to things he had not done. His mother and father, who visited him in the Bridewell, said he appeared completely disorientated and was swaying and slurring his words.</P>
      <P>After they left, Dean Lyons made another, written, statement and was then charged with the murders of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan. When this statement was made, there was no video or audio taping. This statement contained a chronologically correct narrative about the murders. Some of the information was known only to the real murderer and to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The written statement is in clear, mostly grammatically correct English. Dean Lyons had left school with partial reading and writing skills and he had a very limited vocabulary. On the basis of his confession he was charged with the murders.</P>
      <P>Three weeks later, Mark Nash was arrested in Roscommon and also admitted to the Grangegorman murders, again giving information that was known only to Garda detectives. Mark Nash has been convicted of the Roscommon killings but, despite his confession to the Grangegorman murders, he has not been charged with them. Dean Lyons remained in prison for eight months before the State Solicitor withdrew the charges, giving no reason.</P>
      <P>Three years after becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell has still taken no action to investigate this fortuitously aborted attempted miscarriage of justice. Concern about these cases does not come just from the usual suspects, namely disaffected cranks and agitators. Let us consider this voice from the coalface. Retired Circuit Court judge Anthony Murphy, who presided over criminal tri<Col N="694"/>als for Cork city and county for many years, told &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;: &ldquo;There have been occasions when the guards have committed perjury in my court&rdquo;. Mr. Murphy added that, when he heard confessions that were:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">couched in Templemore phraseology . . . I had a simple rule about it. If there was a confession and nothing else, the man walked.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This boils down to an allegation from the bench of a concerted practice on the part of garda&iacute; to pervert the course of justice yet we have heard no adequate response to this allegation since then. It might as well not have been made. Successive Ministers for Justice and their officials in the permanent administration have known about these cases but they have not seen it to be in their interests, or the public interest, to do anything about it.</P>
      <P>Before the parties opposite get into childish tit-for-tat retaliation I am aware this party has had periods in Government. I know the Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government of 1982 included a commitment to establish a Garda authority. I would be interested to know when and how that commitment ran into the ground. The fact that nothing, or at any rate not enough, happened then is no excuse for inaction now.</P>
      <P>What is required, as the then Minister for Justice Michael Noonan stated in May 1983, is &ldquo;an appropriate balance between the need for proper control and accountability on the one hand and, on the other hand, the need for the force to be able to go about its work unhindered by undue interference from any source&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I accept and adopt Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s approach. There can be no question of surrendering control of the force to any body not answerable to this House, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, tried to claim had almost happened. That allegation is just a distraction to draw attention away from the inaction on their watch. The two Deputies play word games about reports, synopses, summaries and appendices. The fact is they were told more than enough and soon enough but they tried, for as long as they could, to get away with doing nothing.</P>
      
      <P>I also share Deputy Noonan&rsquo;s views on the need to protect the force from political interference. The reality is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has become one of the most politicised institutions in this State, including not just office politics or institutional politics but party politics. The Moriarty tribunal heard evidence last week about how a Taoiseach could arrange interviews with the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners for the benefit of one of his donors. We know that the same Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government exercised an utterly malign influence over the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na right up to the level of the Deputy Commissioner with responsibility for national security. It was one of the most sordid episodes of our recent his<Col N="695"/>tory, involving a flagrant violation of constitutional rights and a violation of the integrity of the force. Yet no one within the force shouted stop.</P>
      
      <P>More jovial elements in the Fianna F&aacute;il party could revel in the &ldquo;pint or a transfer&rdquo; culture but the Taoiseach was attempting to subvert public institutions, to create nothing short of his own, privatised police force that would serve his own, private purposes. That Taoiseach also had his own private bank, which the regulatory authorities either did not or could not touch.</P>
      <P>At the same time the manager of Dublin county had his own private practice as a planning adviser, charging money to the developers he was meant to police. When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na failed to make progress in any of their investigations into planning scandals, they nonetheless felt obliged to record a ringing endorsement of the character of at least one of those being investigated, a former colleague of the present Taoiseach, along with a virtual apology for presuming that he could do wrong. Again, no one in any of those public bodies called a halt. To this day nobody from the public service has come out to give information.</P>
      <P>The reason my party wants a Garda authority is the same reason it wants to see the long promised and much delayed Revenue Act, which is meant to protect the operational independence of the Revenue Commissioners. It is the same reason we want the Freedom of Information Act rescued and restored from the savage filleting it has endured at the hands of this Government. It is the same reason we want transparent, effective and properly policed planning legislation.</P>
      <P>We believe in a public service that belongs to and is answerable to the public and that is incapable of being corrupted to serve private interests. There are those of a certain vintage, retired from politics or public administration, who routinely remind us that, for all this State&rsquo;s other defects, we at least have an independent, impartial and trustworthy public service &mdash; civil, police and military &mdash; of undoubted integrity. I do not know for how long they will continue to make that boast or how many exceptions they will have to admit, while insisting that exceptions simply go to prove the rule.</P>
      <P>In all the investigations, inquiries, hearings, trials and reports that I can think of, there has not been a single instance of a public servant, local or national, who has been willing to go on the public record to expose wrongdoing by his or her political masters. We have not had an on-the-record whistleblower since the foundation of the State. The reality is that during the years in which one party has wielded power in this State, our public service has become more concerned with discerning its master&rsquo;s voice than with finding its own.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a political philosophy which doubles up as a catchy election slogan: &ldquo;You can trust any <Col N="696"/>Government at all, so long as he and his party are in it, keeping a beady eye on the other lot, on behalf of the rest of us.&rdquo; I prefer to put my trust, in the words of John Adams, in &ldquo;a government of laws and not of men&rdquo;. It is not sufficient, when one uncovers wrong, simply to remove the wrongdoers. One must examine the system and the processes which allowed that wrong to happen and which will, if left in place, permit similar wrongdoing to flourish and will enable future wrongdoers to escape culpability.</P>

	<P>Last Friday, this House heard four hours of statements on the second report of the Morris tribunal of inquiry into the Garda investigation of the death of Richie Barron and the extortion telephone calls to the home of Michael and Charlotte Peoples. The House heard the extraordinary findings of the Morris tribunal that innocent citizens in Donegal had been harassed, intimidated, threatened, bullied, blackmailed, assaulted and framed by garda&iacute; in the course of a murder investigation where no murder had occurred.</P>
      <P>The House also heard that senior garda&iacute; in Donegal were complicit or negligent in the sham investigation. The House heard that Garda headquarters had responded inefficiently and ineffectively. In addition, the House heard that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions had succumbed to a bureaucratic and paralysing malaise concerning the whole matter.</P>
      <P>The picture of a seriously dysfunctional criminal justice system detailed in this second report by Mr. Justice Morris was mirrored in the first interim report of the Morris tribunal and, we were told in the House last week by no less a person than the Taoiseach, will continue in future reports.</P>
      <P>The human trauma and tragedy of innocent civilians being subjected to a criminal conspiracy by agents of the State are the most pressing and immediate concerns arising from the Morris tribunal. These concerns must be addressed in terms of apologies, legal representation and compensation.</P>
      <P>For example, I spoke to Sheenagh McMahon yesterday and she is furious that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave no commitment on Friday last that he would issue an apology to her and her family. She was previously married to Detective Garda Noel McMahon and has lived a nightmare since 1992. Bombs were made in her house, plots were hatched by garda&iacute; and their informers. She was taken into custody, her children were taken from her and she had a mental breakdown. She made a statement to the Carty committee in 1999, but withdrew it under pressure from garda&iacute;. When she got her files back through a freedom of information request the most important details were garbled through deletions.</P><Col N="697"/>
      <P>Having been rebuffed at every turn by agents of the State and having had her life ruined, Sheenagh McMahon courageously brought her files to the tribunal and told her story to Mr. Justice Morris. Does she and her young family not deserve a formal apology from the State? Will the Minister make a commitment today to give it to her?</P>
      <P>Moreover, Mr. Frank McBrearty Jr. told me that in the High Court yesterday the State offered him only a conditional apology. Apparently, the State does not accept that a confession to a murder that never occurred cannot be a confession.</P>
      <?oasys _dc14-?>
      <P>In the long term, the reputation of, and public confidence in, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have suffered a very serious blow. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has assured us that he has everything under control and that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 addresses all the issues and covers all the bases, but that is patently untrue. The Bill is an amalgam of provisions lacking in a coherent philosophy. That is demonstrated by the bevy of new amendments we received this evening, many of them in draft form, for Report Stage.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is a hybrid that has changed again and again as flaws appeared in one proposal or another. The Minister has put the cart before the horse. Instead of conducting a root and branch examination of the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, researching best practice abroad and determining a framework for a force that would be relevant to policing needs in the 21st century, the Minister has decided to fill in the widening cracks and put a fresh coat of paint on the surface.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears not to recognise that it is insufficient to dismiss wrongdoing as the activities of a few bad apples and then assert that the body corporate is essentially sound. Neither does he recognise that the Donegal scandal is a watershed for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is similar to the corrupt payments scandal for politicians, the DIRT inquiry for the banks and the cases of institutional abuse for the church. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the latest pillar of society that has been found to be crumbling.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow a chief superintendent to retire and walk away as though nothing had happened, when he was found to have been seriously at fault in the duty of supervision and management by Mr. Justice Morris in the tribunal&rsquo;s first interim report.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that Superintendent Joe Shelley and Detective Superintendent John McGinley will retire on full pension on 31 July 2005 and walk away from their mess. Their management of the investigation into the death of Richie Barron in October 1996 was, in the words of Mr. Justice Morris, &ldquo;prejudiced, tendentious and utterly negligent in the highest degree&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, Superintendent Shelley has previous form. His track record smacks of incompetence and negligence concerning both the Kerry babies case and the Abbeylara <Col N="698"/>affair. The transfer of five rank and file garda&iacute; from Donegal to Dublin, which was heavily criticised by Mr. Justice Morris, lacks logic and precedent.</P>
      <P>Surely the proper response of a concerned Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and, indeed, a concerned Garda Commissioner, should be to send the Morris report and relevant files to the Director of Public Prosecutions and await his decision, rather than signal to all the garda&iacute; concerned that they are being let off the hook?</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is seriously flawed. Even if it was not flawed, however, it could not achieve what the Minister says it will. No legislation will effect fundamental reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na unless the garda&iacute; and the public are brought into the process through consultation and engagement, and a new police culture of service is established.</P>
      <P>Good policing is at the heart of crime prevention and crime detection. When the London metropolitan police force was established in 1829 its first commissioners, Rowan and Maguire, wrote:</P>
      <P LI="1">Every member of the force must remember that his duty is to protect and help members of the public, no less than to apprehend guilty persons. Consequently, whilst prompt to prevent crime and arrest criminals, he must look upon himself as the servant and guardian of the general public and treat all law-abiding citizens, irrespective of their social positions, with unfailing patience, courtesy and good humour.</P>
      <P FLI="0">These sentiments mirror the views of Michael Staines, the first Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who, in 1922, stated: &ldquo;The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will succeed not by force of arms but by their moral authority as servants of the people.&rdquo; These were brave sentiments at a time when the Civil War had just started and armed men were roaming the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to creating an unarmed police force, the founders of the State had got to the core of the issue. Their vision was that the new police would be guardians of the peace and servants of the people, gaining their moral authority from their service, no longer policing the community like the RIC they had replaced, but dutifully serving the community.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na served the community well throughout most of the 20th century. However, at the beginning of the 21st century there is clearly need to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of the force in a modern, urban, rapidly changing and complex society. Serious questions have been posed of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent times, ranging from the present harsh criticism by Mr. Justice Morris of the behaviour of certain garda&iacute; in Donegal, to the failure to tackle the spread of drugs nationwide, the declining crime prevention and detection rate and the rising clamour of public discontent regarding <Col N="699"/>Garda professionalism and commitment. The Labour Party believes the time has come for a root and branch review of the role, structures and operations of the Garda.</P>
      <P>It is time to establish an independent commission on policing in Ireland, similar to the independent commission on policing set up under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 to create &ldquo;a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo;. Its terms of reference would require the identification and the setting up of new structures to ensure accountability independent scrutiny and, above all, partnership with the community.</P>
      <P>The new independent commission&rsquo;s methodology would involve a comprehensive consultative process. A public debate on policing in the 21st century would be initiated and the commission would take that debate to the highways and byways of the country where it would engage local communities in parish halls the length and breadth of Ireland. Equally those professionally involved in policing at every level would be consulted and best international practice would be ascertained. Simply lecturing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and enacting legislation will not lead to progress. Garda&iacute; must be invited to come on board and engage in inclusive debate. As P. J. Stone of the GRA said yesterday, the approach must be holistic, not piecemeal.</P>
      <P>The findings of the Patten commission on policing constitute a valuable resource and reservoir of material that can be drawn from and adopted. The consultation process is crucial. A lasting new police culture of service can only be delivered if a sense of participation, responsibility and ownership is engendered through the consultative process.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte referred to the cosy cartel that is the relationship between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner and to the proposal in the programme for Government in 1982 to establish a Garda authority to act as a buffer to protect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from any undue political interference on the one hand and the need for proper control and accountability on the other. Such a body would address planning, budgeting, reporting, promotions and oversee the administrative and effective management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>In his first report Mr. Justice Morris decried &ldquo;the promotion to senior ranks of persons who were unwilling or unable to give their vocation the energy and aptitude that it demands&rdquo;. Senior Garda promotional opportunities, in the gift of the Government of the day, are not the way forward for rewarding merit. The present Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will not change this procedure, despite what the Minister has said. In the same interim report, Mr. Justice Morris pointed out the total ignorance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department of <Col N="700"/>what was happening in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at any given time, that they were in the dark and entirely dependent on the information supplied to them from Garda headquarters and that they had no way of checking its accuracy or validity.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell&rsquo;s response to Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s plea for proper oversight structures to be established was to introduce a Garda inspectorate, a body that would be the eyes and ears of the Minister, would be directed in its work by him and would report back to him. It would be the Minister&rsquo;s personal spy network within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In this proposal the Minister sees his role not as a policy-maker or legislator but as a sort of zealous despot. I assure him that nobody will be hated so much within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na nor damage Garda morale more than the body that will became known as &ldquo;McDowell&rsquo;s inspectors&rdquo;. They will go into Garda folklore like the Broy Harriers of a different era.</P>
      <P>In his first report, Mr. Justice Morris criticised the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for an ombudsman commission as &ldquo;cumbersome and time consuming&rdquo;. Again in the current report, he returns to this important matter and states: &ldquo;The Tribunal is much concerned by the lack of any independent body to receive legitimate concerns about Garda behaviour. The provisions of the Garda Bill need to be reviewed by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister intends to press on regardless with his heavily criticised three-person ombudsman commission. A multi-member commission lacks the clarity of identification and responsibility of a single person commission, lacks decision-making procedures and restricts independent access to Garda stations. It will have some garda&iacute; conducting investigations into Garda wrongdoing. The proposed ombudsman commission is engulfed confusingly in a massive 50 sections of &ldquo;dos&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;ts&rdquo; in the Garda Bill and will only have a fraction of the resources and personnel allocated to the superb one-person ombudsman in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The old discredited Garda complaints body needs to be replaced by a robust, totally independent structure that can engage in investigations as well as receive complaints, that can look to past as well as to future transgressions and that is directed and led by a single ombudsman.</P>
      <P>The work of an ombudsman would be all the easier if the 1979 recommendations of the Judge Barra O&rsquo;Briain committee were implemented, namely, that all detention and questioning in Garda custody should be the subject of audio and video-recording. These valuable recommendations of a quarter of a century ago should be placed on a statutory and mandatory basis in either the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill or the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
      <P>The Garda Bill is silent on education and training. The Minister can scarcely call the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill fundamental reforming legislation if he totally fails to address the training and educational needs of a modern police force. Education and training of Garda recruits have been <Col N="701"/>carried out in Templemore college, County Tipperary since the formation of the State. Templemore has served the country well and is internationally respected for the quality of its work. It is located in a rural idyllic setting which is conducive to tranquil learning. The Minister has recently decided to provide a four-storey extension to enable the extra 2,000 garda&iacute; to be recruited and trained over the next couple of years.</P>
      <P>It is time we reviewed the role of Templemore as the sole centre for training and education for garda&iacute;. An historic opportunity currently exists to locate a second Garda education and training centre in Grangegorman on the north side of Dublin. The Dublin Institute of Technology is building the largest third level college in the country on the site and the enabling legislation is currently going through the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Thank God I did not come up with that suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>A Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na college or a police academy could easily become the seventh faculty in the DIT. The 70-acre site has 30 acres of playing fields and will have a wide range of other sporting facilities. It is located in an inner city urban setting and reflects the general context of where most policing work is carried out in a modern Ireland that has rapidly changed from rural to urban in character. Garda students would mix and interact with their peers in other third level disciplines, not just with their trainee colleagues as currently.</P>
      <P>The Grangegorman site is ideally located for in-service courses and for further education. Research studies in such areas as policing methods, crime statistics and criminology could be established and an integrated policy dimension could be added. It should be possible to share some facilities with the PSNI, to establish a link with the new police college in Northern Ireland and with police forces in Europe and elsewhere. A Garda college in Dublin would not replace Templemore, but rather add an extra dimension that would make the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a thoroughly modern and professional force in tune with best policing practice anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform should seize the opportunity that now presents itself and undertake a root and branch review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That is imperative.</P>

	<P>I expect to receive his report in due course. I also want to respond to many of the points which were made about matters like the recording of statements made by persons in custody. As Deputy Costello has probably forgotten, it was made clear at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights that 96% of statements are now recorded. I hope we can ensure soon that the other 4% of statements can be recorded. I will be quite happy to provide in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 that the recording of statements should be a universal practice. I have no problem with that issue.</P>
      <P>Opposition Members have made a concerted effort to suggest I have not consulted people about the process of reform. Nothing could be further from the truth. I refer Members to the Deloitte &amp; Touche report about strategic management in the Garda, for example. When I took office, there was an agenda in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to put in place an independent complaints mechanism to replace the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board. I decided a root and branch reconstitution of the Garda was needed.</P>
      <P>I favour putting in place a single statute to restate the relationships between the Garda and the Executive, between the Garda and local communities, through the local authorities, and between the Garda and the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Garda Commissioner should become the force&rsquo;s accounting officer and therefore accountable to the committees of this House. Rather than being a cosy cartel, the relationship between the Commissioner and the Minister of the day should be transparent and based on written exchanges of directions and annual policing plans etc. All of these things are provided for in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and will come to pass when it becomes law.</P>

	<P>I find it rich that the Labour Party has suggested in its motion that I should not proceed with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, which was the subject of a process of consultation after its heads were published. The Bill has been changed significantly on foot of an extensive Second Stage debate in this House, lengthy consideration on all Stages in the Seanad and a Committee Stage debate of record duration at the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. I have listened carefully to the points which have been made at all stages of that process. I have adapted the Bill, in line with the <Col N="704"/>constructive points which have been made by way of criticism of it, to improve the legislation as best I can.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has suggested that I should put the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, which was prepared in the context of the establishment of the Morris tribunal and has had to await the publication of the tribunal&rsquo;s two reports, on hold for 18 months. It has proposed that I should establish a commission and retain the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board during that time.

The Labour Party was in office with Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in the 1990s, as Deputy Rabbitte will recall, but it did not attempt to resurrect this discredited idea before now. The establishment of an independent police authority would damage seriously the right of the D&aacute;il to hold me accountable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I initiated this process of reform as soon as I was appointed as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I published consultation papers and engaged in consultation with the representative associations. I sent the heads of the Bill to the Irish Human Rights Commission, whose criticisms I later took on board. The process that has led us to where we are today is not as it was described by the Labour Party this evening &mdash; it is totally different. This process involves a Minister who is determined to bring about change, but is being challenged by a party that promised change but did sweet nothing when it had an opportunity to make changes. Although the Labour Party promised change, it did nothing.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Serious issues have been raised by the two reports of the Morris tribunal which have been presented to date. The first report referred to the matters in which Ms Sheenagh McMahon was caught up. It has been suggested that I let Ms McMahon down yesterday by failing to name her among the people who are due an apology. I said yesterday that I will apologise to all those who are victims of the Garda misbehaviour exposed in the reports of the Morris tribunal. I repeat that such people will be given the apology to which they are entitled in due course, after all the facts have been established. I am not making a tit-for-tat point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a fantastic proposition. Deputy Rabbitte took a different view of the proposition when his pals, including Kevin Murphy, launched a report about political accountability yesterday. The Deputy wholly endorsed the notion of political accountability that was indicated on that occasion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the House that some amendments will be introduced on Report Stage in response to the reflective debates the House and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights have had about the second Morris report. There will be a new statutory duty for members of the Garda to account for the manner in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Big deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may think it is a big deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was it not included in the original Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Mr. Justice Morris also thought it was a big deal, because he remarked on its absence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Every employee in Ireland is already accountable in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda Commissioner will be in a position to dismiss members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of garda sergeant or inspector rank where the Commissioner has lost confidence in the capacity of that member to discharge his or her duty and where dismissal is considered necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. There will be a provision to strengthen the existing provisions in the Bill to oblige the Garda Commissioner to supply the Minister of the day with all information of significance relating to policing or security matters necessary for the Minister or other law officers of the State to discharge their functions, in a timely fashion. There will be a new provision providing for the strengthening of the existing Garda provision in the Bill on the accountability of the Garda Commissioner. It will make it clear that the Commissioner is fully accountable to the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>There will be a strengthening provision in the Bill on the system of promotion in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That may be of some interest to the House because apparently it has not connected with everyone&rsquo;s understanding at this stage that the Bill currently provides for a system of independent promotion at every rank in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that the chairman and the majority of members of the promotions board must be persons other than garda&iacute;. This is being strengthened and panels for the independent members will be Government appointed under the new provisions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There will be a change in the appointment of the Garda audit committee to be established by the commission. There will be also a professional standards unit established within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enhance best practice and to assess on a constant internal basis whether professional standards are appropriate. There will also be a <Col N="709"/>provision that one of the three-person commission will be appointed as chairperson so that there will be a visible figurehead for the ombudsman commission. There will be a statutory basis for Garda and community-based CCTV systems. Last, there will be a new power which will replace a broadly analogous but narrower power under the Dublin Police Act 1924 for the Minister to appoint a person to carry out special inquiries into any aspect of Garda administration, practice or procedure which gives rise to public concern.</P>
      <P>All these strengthening measures have been taken as a fair response to the Morris commission&rsquo;s second report. They are in addition to the nine reports which the Deputy Commissioner, Peter Fitzgerald, has put in place on the material from the first report. A whistleblowers&rsquo; charter will be provided in statute so that any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can, in confidence, bring to the attention of an appropriate authority any misbehaviour or abuse of power of which that member becomes aware, and it must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the appropriate authority include a TD?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, anyone can go to a TD. It is provided that the provision of information, even confidential information, to a TD or a Member of the Oireachtas does not breach the Garda&rsquo;s duty of confidentiality. This is already included in the Bill in statutory form.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that this Bill is based on consultation and reflection on what went wrong. What went wrong fundamentally was that governance within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na became atrophied or ineffectual. Correspondingly, discipline disintegrated. Accountability became formalised and fossilised, with members feeling entitled to refuse accountability to their superiors and to have access instead to representative association advice or legal advice before answering straightforward questions about the manner in which they carried out their duty.</P>
      <P>I made this point on the last occasion and I repeat it, these did not happen overnight. They must have been present in 1992-95 when the first&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that these issues have been a long time coming and a long time ignored by politicians, and now that they are apparent, they are being dealt with by this politician, unlike other politicians who did nothing about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying that his predecessor could intervene without the Carty report or any of the evidential-based information at the time? There are complaints by the bucket-<Col N="710"/>load that go into the Minister&rsquo;s Department every week. Is he suggesting that some Minister should react off the top of his or her head to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting that. I thought I made the point frankly and fairly. I am not making that point.</P>

	<P>The Minister comes back to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making a different point and if the Deputy cannot understand it, it is a reflection on his capacity to discharge his functions as a leader of a party. My point is different. It is not that every Minister for Justice must regard every fax and every letter as the reason to suddenly cause a massive inquiry into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or that any Minister for Justice could sort through the hundreds of letters they receive every week and say, &ldquo;There is a scandal I must stop immediately.&rdquo; That is an unfair standard to ask of the former Ministers for Justice, Nora Owen and Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, or Deputy Michael McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spent a week broadcasting it in the national media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying that, I am saying that the governance issues with which we are dealing and the atrophy of proper accountability within the force must have been present for at least the best part of two decades. I am the politician who is remedying it and there must be political accountability for all who held office, even in my party who were at the Cabinet table during some of these years, for the situation that existed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>

	<P>If the point made yesterday by Kevin Murphy about the Department of Health and Children has any truth in that context, which appeared to have a lot of support from the Opposition benches today, it is equally true about Garda management. If there had been problems for 20 years plus, I cannot be politically accountable because I am dealing with them, any more than they were the political accountability of those who failed to deal with them, even though, as Deputy Rabbitte has helpfully pointed out to the House. the requirement for an independent police authority was apparent to his party from <Col N="711"/>1982, for five years, and they did not deliver one line or section of it. They walked away from it.</P>

	<P>The issue is knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the general philosophical political point he is making now about this dereliction being incipient in the Garda force for 20 years is not the point he promulgated alone and separately for a full week when he said that those with their knees under the Cabinet table in 1997 were responsible for the events in Donegal? This is what the Minister said and it is what he intended to say, which is a different point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy made his point of information, which I reject. The point I wanted to make was that those who sat around the Cabinet table when the basic preconditions for what has been exposed in the Morris tribunal came to pass must share accountability for that with those who have since been in office when the matters came to light. They must accept that they are at least as culpable as yours truly, who is now remedying the situation whereas they failed to remedy it. They walked away from governance issues in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for years. The Labour Party was ten years in office and it walked away from this issue and never delivered one line of it. That is what the record shows.</P>

	<P>The House has a duty to ensure the Garda functions today, tomorrow, next week and next month to the highest standards and all of us share that duty. Now is the time to put in place a genuinely independent complaints system, a new framework for the governance of the Garda, an inspectorate to ensure there are high standards in the Garda, benchmarked to the best international practice and a whistleblower&rsquo;s charter. Now is the time to give the Garda the internal systems which will allow it to be responsive to the House, local authorities and to the community and to make statutory provision for the establishment of a reserve because Garda numbers matter and they must be increased in a society whose population is increasing and where criminality and its complexity is ever more demanding in terms of the force&rsquo;s resources and time.</P>

      <P>Today, tomorrow and the next day our streets must be policed.

	<P>No, the Minister is not. That is a complete distortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not do it. I do not subscribe to the venal political habit of saying the Garda is a wonderful force, nobody should criticise it and reminding everybody about the thin blue line. I do not engage in such activity. I have had to take a fair amount of heat and flak regarding my proposals to reform the Garda. I have had to face criticism at every hand&rsquo;s turn for what I am doing but I am proud of the Garda and the huge majority of its members who carry out their functions in a professional, courteous way.</P>
      <P>Would the force&rsquo;s sternest critics be willing to discharge the functions of an ordinary man or woman who enlists in the Garda for a week or a month? Would they go to the door of an accident victim&rsquo;s family and say a son or daughter has been killed? Would they stand guard while bodies lie on the ground for hours on end? Would they risk their lives at bank robberies or confronting armed subversives in our society? Many good garda&iacute; have engaged in these activities and I want to give them leadership and constructive reform, not a thrashing in public for what they have or have not done.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I stand by the great majority who support the legislation I have introduced, even though it is a challenge for them. Many of their preconceptions will not merely be challenged but broken under the new regime that will unfold when the legislation is implemented. The Garda is our only police force and getting it from its present state, which is one of challenge and one in which failures have been exposed, back to where we want it to be &mdash; a force of which everybody is proud, in which is everybody has confidence and which is governed and manned to the highest professional standards &mdash; requires a balanced approach from this House to the question of reform.</P><Col N="714"/>
      <P>The white heat of outrage is understandable in the context of the Morris tribunal reports, especially when one reflects, as Deputy Costello eloquently stated on the last occasion, that but for the grace of God, innocent people could be serving life sentences arising from one incident of wrongdoing that was discovered. The white heat of outrage must be tempered by the fact the force has served the country well. There are empty seats in the House but the force has taken the most appalling stick from people who hate this State and revile the Garda. They never lost an opportunity to dismiss or subvert the force and have on occasions taken the lives of its members.</P>
      <P>The force has served the country well and the failings that have recently become apparent beyond contradiction must be corrected and addressed but a new police force will not be established and the Garda will not be swept away as something that can be discarded so that we can start again. We must go on with what is there, the bulk of which is a legacy of commitment, professionalism, courage and decency, which is the material to achieve reform. Leadership and a determination to bring about change is required from the Government, myself and the top garda&iacute;. That, in turn, requires that we are moderate and balanced in our approach, that we are considered in how we go about the process of change and that we do not just lay all about us and dismiss and hack down things of value because it suits the political mood and the timing of the political calendar to posture on these issues as we approach the end of a D&aacute;il session.</P>
      <P>I have a heavy responsibility, which I intend to discharge. I intend to push the legislation through because it has taken long enough to get it to where it is now. This legislation has been adapted to meet the criticisms properly advanced about it. It will be the constitutional foundation of a decent police force and I make no apology for doing that. Wiser counsel in future might result in greater improvements and different solutions to a number of the issues with which I am grappling but if the golden thread of accountability of the police force through the Minister to this House, which is a thing of value, is substituted by something else more in accordance with the political demands of the minute, it will be lost.</P>
      <P>I have heard people wonder if this will be adequate given that there will be different Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and considering some of the people who held that position in the past, but that is not a reason for ending political accountability through the Minister to the D&aacute;il. It is a reason for ensuring that the person who holds the position of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is of the high standard expected of every office holder in the House. The Irish political elite, if we can describe ourselves as such, has done huge things in the past few years to ensure that misbehaviour is a thing of the past in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>The Irish public is entitled to look to future generations of politicians to exercise account<Col N="715"/>ability for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this House on the basis of the model put forward by our Constitution, which is ministerial accountability to elected representatives in this House and Garda accountability to committees of these Houses and, through the local policing committees, to local authorities. Those are the right steps. I am confident that the measures I have put forward contain the solution to the structural problems that exist and that they will provide the trellis against which different values will grow strongly, to provide us in the future with a decent police force of which we are proud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate should not be about the ego of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. The danger is that the overbearing arrogance of the Minister tends to submerge the issues. What are those issues? The Minister tends to question the motivation of Members on this side of the House, particularly of colleagues in the Labour Party, but he fails to accept the genuine view of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and virtually all Members of the House that we should have a police force that is reformed, has high morale, whose members have pride and confidence in their force and, above all, a force in which the public has pride and confidence. It is wrong of the Minister to question the motivation of those who put forward proposals which try to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The Minister misrepresented the Labour Party in that he suggested it does not wish to see reform because it is putting forward a proposal for a policing commission, but nothing could be further from the truth. That is not in the Labour Party proposal. The Minister is making a serious mistake in not pausing and reflecting on the recommendations of the Morris tribunal and ensuring that the Garda Bill, when it passes, fully reflects the recommendations and advice of that tribunal. It is impossible for that to happen because the tribunal only produced its second report earlier this month but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill is expected to be passed by the House, with all the amendments rushed through, within the next 72 hours. That is not the way to do business. I have been long enough in the House to know that rushed legislation is bad legislation.</P>
      <P>This evening the fax machine in my office started clattering at 4 o&rsquo;clock and produced pages of proposed new draft amendments from the Minister, some of which had not even been finalised by the parliamentary draftsman. These are the amendments we are supposed to discuss and put through Report Stage tomorrow morning. That is not the proper way to pass legislation. It certainly is not the way to deal with one of the great institutions of the State. We owe more to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the vast majority of whom have served this country well through the years, than to treat them like this and to rush on to the Statute Book legislation containing amendments which were not given proper <Col N="716"/>consideration or debate and on which there was no time to take proper advice.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister should stall the Garda Bill and allow reasonable time for a proper review. Later this year the Bill can be passed after proper reflection and full debate. Instead, the Minister says: &ldquo;I must show leadership&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am determined&rdquo; and &ldquo;I will accept my responsibilities&rdquo;. It is an ego trip as far as the Minister is concerned. He spoke about the political calendar. It is not the Opposition that is concluding the proceedings of the House at the end of next week, the Government is doing so. The Minister cannot tell me that because the political calendar, designed by the Government, brings this House to a conclusion at the end of next week, we do not have time to debate properly the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. He is wrong.</P>
      <P>Let us discuss his proposals. He says he will appoint a chairman for the three-person Garda ombudsman committee, rather than have a single ombudsman. That is a total fudge. It makes no progress towards achieving the type of institution in which the garda&iacute; and, more importantly, members of the public will have full confidence. There is no reason that the Minister cannot provide an ombudsman of the same type as exists in Northern Ireland. His current proposal of a three-person committee, even with a chairman, does not meet the overwhelming public demand for a single Nuala O&rsquo;Loan type figure to investigate wrongdoing and deal with complaints.</P>
      <P>It raises the suspicion that the Minister wants to have somebody on the committee who will represent the views of the Department and that, directly or indirectly, there will be an inside track into the committee to keep an eye on what it is doing. That is not what we want and it is not what the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with whom I have discussed this, want. They want it to be done properly, openly and independently. They do not want to be involved in investigating any of these complaints. They want everything to be above board, just as the Opposition and public do.</P>
      <P>The strength of a single independent ombudsman was demonstrated again this week by Kevin Murphy, the former State Ombudsman, when he criticised the failure to allocate political responsibility for the nursing homes scandal. This was a strong statement by a strong independent person who is beholden to no Department, Minister or party. That is what is expected from Kevin Murphy and that is what he gave. It is what we get from Nuala O&rsquo;Loan. Why can we not have the same with a Garda ombudsman? The revelations arising from the second report of the Morris tribunal demand that a single powerful and independent ombudsman be appointed. A three-person body, even with a chairman, simply remains a fudge.</P>
      <P>It has long been Fine Gael policy to establish a commission on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine the efficiency and accountability of the force. Events in Donegal and the recommendations of <Col N="717"/>the second report of the Morris tribunal further highlight the need for this. The Minister misrepresented our colleagues in the Labour Party. I am not suggesting that reform can wait until we have the report of an independent commission. The Labour Party is suggesting, on the other hand, that we have a proper reform approach and a proper Garda Bill. At the same time, however, there is no reason that we should not have a policing commission.</P>
      <P>The Government might claim that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will make a policing commission redundant, but I take the opposite view. The Garda Bill is the direct result of closed discussions within the policing loop of the Department, Garda headquarters and those associated with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda Bill will provide improvements but it does not go far enough. In the meantime, the Government will not even accept the Morris report&rsquo;s recommendation that the Garda Bill be reviewed by the Oireachtas. The closest we came to a discussion of the report was a cursory series of statements last Friday, which clearly was not what Mr. Justice Morris had in mind. Last minute amendments which have not received proper consideration are not the answer.</P>
      <P>As the Government insists on pushing through the Garda Bill in its present form, with only some amendments, the need for the independent commission proposed by the Labour Party is all the more urgent. Nobody but the most prejudiced observer would deny the enormous benefits resulting from the Patton commission on policing in Northern Ireland. Although the Republic has experienced different problems in policing, the problems are nevertheless significant. There must be a root and branch investigation, including an open and fair-minded examination of Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s recommendations. The judge has identified many of the most significant problems in the Garda but these issues must be dealt with in transparency and with accountability. Furthermore, the general public must have total confidence in the structure, role and powers of the complaints procedure. I doubt the measures the Minister proposes will command that level of confidence.</P>
      <P>Neither the Government nor Mr. Justice Morris has touched on certain points, such as what we expect from members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We expect efficiency and effectiveness, particularly when confronted with the reality of crime or anti-social behaviour. We also expect courtesy and civility, and want to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercises the exceptional powers we give it with tact and diplomacy.</P>
      <P>That raises the question of training members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Does it include proper training in that kind of approach? It may not be ideal to segregate trainee garda&iacute; from other young men and women so that they become part of the institutional structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, without the possibility of the social interchange available in college. It may be time to take <Col N="718"/>a more integrated approach to training garda&iacute;. This is only one issue we should consider in the context of an independent commission on policing.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party motion, which I support, covers these issues in broad detail. I also support some of the points in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment but he is seriously wrong when he urges us to recognise the comprehensiveness of the reform measures in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. He ignores Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s recommendation in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">He is also wrong to ask us to welcome the provisions of the Bill to establish a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission. I doubt there is any support, even within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for the commission he proposes. He asks the House to acknowledge his commitment to propose amendments to strengthen the Bill. Is he serious? Report and Final Stages of the Bill start tomorrow morning and he asks us to welcome amendments which are not yet fully drafted. The Minister&rsquo;s ego has gone to his head if he expects us to support that kind of approach.</P>
      <P>He has not dealt with the issue of accountability to Parliament and the Fine Gael proposal of a full-scale powerful security committee. He has not even looked at the sort of issues considered in other countries. It is salutary for us to examine what has happened elsewhere. We are not unique. There have been similar problems in other countries.</P>
      <P>I looked at the report of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. The report of that commission reveals the extent to which this Government has failed the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by ignoring many important issues that should be examined before the Minister says he has done the job and introduced legislation that will clear up the problem once and for all. The royal commission considered leadership in the police force in New South Wales, its lack of direction and openness, and the inadequate focus of the staff. The report also covers the process of reform and the professionalism, or lack of it, within the force; systems, procedures and police culture; how the police force is involved in different types of law enforcement, including areas in which it was specifically involved and some in which it should not be involved; and the organisational and managerial structure of the police service. There has been no open debate in this House or elsewhere on the organisational structure of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>The commission also considered suggestions for a revised chain of command, the question of deployment, and police and crime rates. It examined the various agencies within the force, another topic we have not discussed. These include the special branch, crime agencies, and others within the New South Wales police force. It considered employment, recruitment, entry and retirement ages, the question of non-executive officers, and issues such as the terms in contracts of employment and lateral entry. These are <Col N="719"/>examples of the preliminary issues examined for that report.</P>
      <P>It also looked at management, leadership training, ethics and integrity, responsibility for education and training, and discussed promotions and transfers and reform of those procedures. The commission considered what is done for police injured on duty, civilian support, administrative services, salaries and allowances, and secondary employment. I have merely touched on the index to identify some of the issues the royal commission considered.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister telling us that because he has issued the second report of the Morris tribunal, and will rush through a few amendments to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill, he has completed the job of reforming the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. He must accept this is not the right way to complete this job. It is important to ensure the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is as good as it can be. We owe that to the 12,000 members of the force, most of whom serve the country well, and all of whom will do so when the Bill is implemented.</P>
      <P>I wish to have confidence in the Bill and be satisfied that the types of structures established will achieve the kind of effective organisation we all want. The general public must also have full and complete confidence in that Bill. The revelations from Donegal have badly dented that confidence. The Minister does not understand the depth of public concern arising from that loss of confidence.</P>
      <P>While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill and a policing commission are linked, the commission does not have to delay the completion of the Bill. The timetable should be that the final Stages of the Bill are postponed until after the recess when its terms would be completely examined. Deputy Kenny made a sensible proposal in that regard, namely, that there be an outside examination of the Bill to ensure it incorporates all the recommendations of the Morris report.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does this my party will offer a constructive input in the autumn to ensure a revised Bill is put in place to achieve our aims. I suppose I should warn him that I am very much against the complaints committee about which he is talking, which he calls an ombudsman commission but which is no such thing. I feel very strongly about that. I am also very much against section 75, which precludes a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from complaining. However, those are issues we can talk through, and I hope, in the course of time, we can convince the Minister, particularly if there is an outside view on it.</P>
      <P>Having completed that timetable and got the Garda Bill in place before the end of this year, we will still need the commission on policing, since so many aspects have not been considered in the context of the debate on the Garda Bill. We also want to see how the changes made in the Garda Bill bed down and whether the objectives outlined have been achieved by it. In many ways, the ideal timing would be to have the commission on <Col N="720"/>policing sitting when the Garda Bill has been put in place so that it can assess its effectiveness. Then, as suggested by the Labour Party, there would be the possibility, after the 18-month period mentioned, to come back, make a full report, and bring the whole operation one stage further. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na itself would be completely happy with that, and above all, it would have the full confidence of the general public. That is the way forward, and I commend it to the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The final shape of this Bill is very unsatisfactory, in that we are debating things here with approximately 65 minutes until a guillotine, something that we saw for the first time only a few days ago. This Bill started off as a Maritime Safety Bill with several key elements that we discussed on Second Stage, and then on Committee Stage we were presented with a series of amendments. I know the Minister informed us regarding the emergency licensing requirement he proposed to include. Now we have a new Part 6 and legislation to do with the extension of the foreshore, and the Bill has grown like topsy within a relatively short period. Legislation that Deputy Perry and I addressed on Second Stage, essentially as a Maritime Safety Bill, now has added dimensions.</P>
      <P>On several occasions in my experience of invigilating this Department on behalf of the Labour Party we have had add-ons. I register a complaint, as I did with the Ceann Comhairle earlier this evening regarding the handling of this Bill. It is bad enough that we have all this material submitted to us very late and in a fairly confusing manner. I appreciate the fact that civil servants have sent us e-mail explanations and so on, but it seems a bad way to do business, given that we have needed this legislation for at least the past two or three decades, and certainly since the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was established. Now we are in the dog days heading for the summer recess trying to clear the board, and <Col N="721"/>this legislation is being put before us as a series of addenda. In my book, that is not the way to do business, and I say that to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was decided, but I was not allowed to raise my original complaint. I want to register that, since it informs what I have to say. Clearly, we have nearly 60 amendments, and we will only get a short way. I am not castigating this Minister of State or these civil servants, but the overall way the Government treats important legislation is disgraceful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>What is before the House is a motion to recommit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just one comment, which follows from those of Deputy Broughan. I fully appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s work on this Bill, but it appears that we are now talking about territorial waters, licensing and aquaculture. The Minister has recently taken over as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, and since his appointment he has performed very well. However, the difficulty is that this Bill stretches back so far. The civil servants inherited a great many add-ons that may somewhat dilute the intentions behind the Bill. For the layman looking at it, the additions dilute the main focus, which is maritime safety. This has been discussed, and the Minister of State has now tabled additional amendments. I know the importance of having this dealt with, so let us proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Left">
      <b>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:</b> Is it agreed to recommit amendments Nos. 1 and 52?  Agreed.</P>
    <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 9, after &ldquo;1946,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;SECTION 222B OF THE FISHERIES (CONSOLIDATION) ACT 1959,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment inserts a reference to section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, which is amended by a new section 53 being inserted as part of the Bill. It is linked with amendment No. 52.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a time limit on the <?oasys _ch?>substantive amendment to the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959? We seem to be under a grave time limit regarding 30 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I fully appreciate the points made by Deputies Broughan and Perry. I <Col N="722"/>will make only three quick points, and it is important that I do so.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, we set out to deal with certain high-powered watercraft. I was extremely anxious, and with the co-operation of the Opposition I had hoped to have this enacted by the summer to allow local authorities to proceed with the various regulations. Then I found, having dealt with the Bill in the Seanad, if I were not to introduce amendments regarding the renewal of licences to allow vessels to continue fishing, that by 30 June all vessels under 24 metres would have to have the necessary works completed and surveyed by our own marine surveyors or by a panel, which would be impossible logistically. Vessels over 24 metres are not within my power, since a European regulation deals with them.</P>
      <P>First, one might say that we are compromising on safety, but that is not at issue. Every skipper knows precisely what has to be done, and no one should go to sea unless happy that the boat is in a fit state.</P>
      <P>In addition, Deputies will be aware of another issue because of the last-minute briefing they received regarding foreshore licences. Legal advice has overturned the general understanding of what the foreshore is, and we must address the situation as a matter of priority. I propose to do so by using the Maritime Safety Bill 2004 as a vehicle to confirm in legislation what has been the general understanding of the term. The opinion heretofore was that the foreshore ran to the limits of the territorial sea. Our current understanding of that is 12 miles.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The legislation seeks to confirm this understanding that the jurisdiction is not to the low water mark but to the 12-mile limit. The enactment of this Bill will provide for the validation of action taken up to now on the basis of what was then a quite clear understanding. We have been engaging with the Office of the Attorney General for some weeks and the advice stating that the foreshore is only to the low water mark came formally on 16 June. I was anxious to deal with this matter as soon as possible. If I came back to the House in October with a Bill to provide validation on this point, I would be rightly criticised. I appreciate the points made by both Deputies but I ask them to accept the urgency of this matter and to consider the implications of not acting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Bill recommitted in respect of amendment No. 2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P><Col N="723"/>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, line 10, after &ldquo;1968,&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;SECTION 4 OF THE LANDLORD AND TENANT (GROUND RENTS)<?oasys _jy?>(NO. 2) ACT 1978,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the impact of this in regard to the operation of harbour companies and the lands owned by them? Is this related to the emergency legislation passed some weeks ago in respect of IDA and other bodies? A disgraceful event took place some weeks ago which related to a company in Clonshaugh industrial estate, Diamond Innovation. It is alleged that this company, which is in my constituency, was able, through a series of subleases, to dispose of publicly owned lands. This is the substantive issue in regard to companies that are occupying leases on State land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The substantive amendment is necessary to safeguard leases granted by harbour companies to which the Harbours Act 1996 and the Harbours (Amendment) Act 2000 apply against negation by subleasing arrangements by lessees. Deputy Broughan referred to similar safeguarding provisions in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 2005 in respect of SFADCo, IDA and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. In practical terms, a harbour company may lease to another party and the latter may subsequently sublease the property. In such circumstances, the sublessee could benefit by overruling the basic lease. We must ensure the State is protected against such activities. This is the purpose of the substantive amendment No. 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision for safeguarding leases in amendment No. 53 is important. It is a pity this cannot be done retrospectively because a number of such leases have been granted in the past. Is any law required to give the Minister of State powers to revoke leases that have been in place for 100 years? Properties have been leased at low rents and the lessees have subleased them for a profit. This amendment stipulates that people will in future be somewhat curtailed from re-leasing properties once the lease agreement has been signed. This is an important issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that significant opportunities exist in coastal communities in respect of ports which have in the past been very much neglected. The lack of development that has taken place means development companies are now proposing tax incentive deals in respect of such development. It is important that a rent review mechanism should operate in all such instances after five or ten years to ensure a clear return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome these amendments. However, I wonder why harbour and port companies were not included in the tranche of public <Col N="724"/>bodies to which the emergency legislation introduced some weeks ago applies. I reiterate that I have heard serious complaints from the communities around Clonshaugh in regard to what is alleged to have happened at Diamond Innovation. The lands in question belong to the Irish people but, apparently through subterfuge, this company was able to sell them into private hands, as has been alleged previously in the House.</P>
      <P>I realise such matters are not part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s portfolio. These matters arose during the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s seven-year tenure at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, involving an entire tranche of public lands in Shannon Development and in industrial estates in Dublin and other areas. Questions must be asked as to how we got into this situation in the first place.</P>
      <P>A colleague, Councillor Declan Bree, who shares Deputy Perry&rsquo;s constituency, strongly supports the idea that the Sligo Harbour Commission should be allowed to become a port company. This would prevent it being taken over, as some fear, by the local authority which could have a negative impact down the line on publicly owned lands. I welcome and support this amendment if its effect is to tighten the provisions in this regard and preserve the lands for which citizens have paid through taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Deputies are in a position to support these amendments. Deputy Broughan asked why the harbour companies were not included when the emergency legislation was introduced by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in regard to IDA, SFADCo and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. At that time, not many people were aware of this issue. The contact we have had from Dublin Port highlighted the implications of the failure to include harbour and port companies under the provisions of that legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure there will be no dilution of public or State ownership without the agreement of the State. If this Bill is enacted, I am confident that cannot happen again. We are not in the business of ensuring others will benefit at the expense of the State. Deputy Perry asked about retrospection, a question I anticipated. The advice is that we cannot rescind this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State has done good work in regard to this amendment. Harbours and ports represent important State asserts. As an island nation, they represent a huge resource that was built in previous decades. It is important to have legislation which ensures there is total transparency in regard to the sale of these State assets and that no quangos will be in control. Will decisions regarding the sale of State assets have to be cleared by Cabinet or will the Minister of the day have total discretion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 8, line 30, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A happy situation obtains in that a number of local authorities, including Fingal County Council, have introduced by-laws regulating the use of small pleasure craft, jet skis and other vehicles. This legislation is pressing due to current uncertainty over the legality of such by-laws. The Minister of State is to be commended for bringing this Bill forward.</P>
      <P>A lot of complaints were received from coastal and inland local authorities. Small vehicles and boats have caused problems on the important lakes and rivers that exist within most local authorities. For this reason I propose to change the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that by-laws on this matter will be introduced.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 12, I fear that the words &ldquo;regulating and controlling the operation of craft&rdquo; may be interpreted so as to limit the matters which may be addressed by the by-laws. A grammatical problem arises in the exist<Col N="728"/>ing lines 30 and 31, which contain an ambiguous reference to the operation of craft by a local authority. While the Minister said in the Seanad that the clause was necessary to define the scope of the powers, I ask him to re-investigate the issue.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 is a key amendment. An interesting discussion was held during Second Stage of this Bill on all aspects of this matter. The Minister has a good record in encouraging people to enjoy the water and to conduct recreational activities there. Tribute was paid to our late colleague, Se&aacute;n Doherty, who also encouraged people to enjoy the Shannon and its tributaries. However, other jurisdictions, such as New South Wales, require a personal watercraft driver&rsquo;s licence to operate a jet ski. Drivers or masters of such vessels must pass a qualifying test to be issued with such a licence. The title of master may be too grandiose. Such a requirement means that a minimum level of safety rules would have to be understood and, I hope, practised by the jet ski driver. The introduction of a system of registration of such vehicles is also important, particularly so as to permit authorised officers, including garda&iacute;, to adequately carry out their functions. We felt this step would be taken at some stage so it might as well be now to make this a more comprehensive Maritime Safety Bill. We should have a full licensing and registration system.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 is an additional amendment consequent to our discussions on Committee Stage. We discussed two events, one in Youghal and another off the south-east coast where a number of young people lost their lives when they were using fast leisure vehicles such as water skis and jet skis. The marine casualty investigation board, which has done a great job over the past number of years in holding important investigations into water safety, felt that in a number of cases wearing helmets and other protective clothing would have played an important role in saving lives. The Minister of State added many amendments on this Stage and he might also consider this one.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 is consequent on amendment No. 12 in trying to extend the scope of the amendments. That is the last of my amendments, which seek to provide a registration and licensing system and to increase the pleasurable use of the seas and our waterways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Broughan on these important amendments. This Bill covers a large amount but its backbone is registration, licensing and wearing protective clothing. The inclusion of registration and the use of protective equipment would lead by example and would show respect for the operation and dangers involved. Given the level of risk and the number of accidents that occur in coastal areas by-laws to identify the owner of each jet ski through registration would send a clear message. It would create a core objective of maritime safety. Incorporating Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendments <Col N="729"/>would add substantially to the backbone of the Bill which should be maritime safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As I promised Deputy Broughan, I gave serious consideration since Committee Stage to the inclusion of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo; but having considered it I still hold the view it would be a waste of effort and resources to require every authority to make by-laws when some might not need to do so.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that our colleagues on local authorities in coastal areas or with lakes or rivers in their operational area are anxious to have this legislation enacted so they can proceed to make by-laws. It is a matter for each local authority to decide whether there is a need to make the by-laws under section 6 of the Bill. Deputies are aware that making by-laws can be a lengthy process, involving public consultation of at least one month plus seven days. It should only be undertaken if there is a clear need to do so, and who better to decide that than local authority members? When we consider local authorities have many important tasks it could be a waste of effort and resources to require them to needlessly make by-laws. I am quite satisfied that any local authority needing to make such by-laws has full power to do so under this Act and retaining &ldquo;may&rdquo; without substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is a clear advance on the current position. In the case of city and county councils, making by-laws under section 6 is a reserved function and as such is a matter for the elected representatives who would proceed to make such by-laws if there is a need to do so.</P>
      <P>Agreeing to the deletion in amendment No. 12 would mean a lack of focus in this section, which solely deals with the regulation and control of craft of a specified class and has no other purpose. According to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann the power to make by-laws under section 6 must be within specific parameters laid down by the Oireachtas. I am advised there can be no open-ended power to make such by-laws.</P>
      <P>The questioning of licensing and registering users of jet skis or other personal watercraft is a matter for national provision rather than piecemeal arrangements varying from one local authority to another which would duly interfere with the use of craft across authority boundaries. I support the idea of establishing a register and I confirm to the House as I did on Committee Stage that the question of establishing a small vessel register, to include jet skis and other personal watercraft, is under consideration by my Department following public consultation. Registration is necessary and I assure Deputies I will work towards it. It is not a question of procrastination.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 deals with general operating conditions for craft including the wearing of personal protective equipment, which is a matter for national provision rather than the piecemeal arrangement I referred to varying from one authority to another. I wish to draw <Col N="730"/>Deputies&rsquo; attention to the merchant shipping, pleasure craft and life jackets and operation safety regulations of 2004 for which there is a statutory instrument. These are for national operation.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 would not accord with the constitutional provisions for secondary legislation, namely for the Oireachtas as primary legislators to set the limits in policies and principles within which secondary legislation may be made. There can be no question of open-ended powers for any of the relevant local authorities to make by-laws at will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the point made by the Minister of State on the two key amendments, Nos. 13 and 14, but this is an opportunity to set a standard at national level for local authorities. Local authorities themselves have different requirements for land vehicles. I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s words on registration but I cannot see how this will be advanced if this legislation or the wording of the Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment No. 13 is not in place. To have a basic standard of licensing would be a huge step forward.</P>
      <P>With regard to the subject matter of amendment No. 14, good work has been done by the marine safety directorate and the coast guard in recent years. It is sanguine to remember it was only in 2003 that the Minister of State&rsquo;s predecessors, Deputy John Browne and Deputy Dermot Ahern, required people on small craft to wear life jackets.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It took us a long time and a number of terrible tragedies, which the Marine Casualty Investigation Board rightly highlighted, to do that. It also highlighted the outrageous folly of people putting out to sea on overloaded pleasure craft, often in dangerous conditions and under very poor direction. I respect the fact that many elements of the Bill address the concerns in all the reports in my office from the MCIB. Nonetheless, it would be a brave move on the part of the Minister of State to accept these amendments, particularly amendments Nos. 13 and 14. That would set a standard and indicate that we are as serious about the marine environment as we are about the land environment. The Irish Water Safety Association investigates approximately 84 deaths per annum, which is 84 too many. We could set a high standard in the late hours of this D&aacute;il session if the Minister accepted amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to make it clear that I said it was not a question of procrastination in terms of the small vessels register. It will not require primary legislation. The Minister of the day will have power under section 20 of the 1992 Act and section 45 of this Bill to introduce ministerial regulations to establish such a register. I will do that as soon as it is practical to do so, bearing in mind the public consultation and the various views that have been expressed to me <Col N="731"/>regarding amendments Nos. 13 and 14. I see where Deputy Broughan is coming from but I emphasise that this is a matter for national provision rather than crossing the various local authority boundaries.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the various local authorities, we could find ourselves in a situation where local authorities have different views on by-laws. We hope that they will work closely with the officials in our Department who will, if necessary, provide a template for the various local authorities to ensure consistency throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to hear the Minister support the idea of a template and a code of operation for local authorities, particularly those in communities along the coastline. The Minister indicated that he would do the marketing of the Bill, so to speak. It is important that once the Bill is enacted it is actively promoted in local authorities and that there will be a level of responsibility on their part to engage in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated also that a register of owners can be established by regulation. That is very important from the point of view of knowing the number of people involved. It will also encourage people to sign up to their rights and responsibilities in this area. Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendments are very well researched in that they deal with the kernel of the problem, namely, where local authorities do not take ownership of the problem. That is the direction that is being given. The Minister must realise that in many cases local authorities have stood by in terms of port companies being in dereliction of their duty. They may not have had ownership but they did not take an initiative to develop this area with communities. In seaside resorts where they had authority to introduce by-laws, they were very slow to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he will put local authorities on notice to engage actively with this legislation. A ministerial direction should be given to every county manager who will be expected to seriously take on board the provisions in the Bill. It is important also that there is a review mechanism in the Department because we could spend a great deal of time enacting legislation which may not become operational until a tragedy occurs.</P>
      <P>With the limited scope in certain sections of the Bill it is important that the Minister proactively encourages local authorities to get back to him within a certain timeframe and indicate their views about the Bill, what they can do with it and how that will benefit the interests of safety in rivers, lakes and major coastal areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been no major changes in the aspects of the Bill the local authorities are dealing with, but we had a seminar with local authority officials last year. We keep the county managers and, consequently, the members of the local authorities fully briefed and <Col N="732"/>we will continue to do that. We will work closely with them and I give a personal assurance to the House that the relevant officials in the Department and I will monitor developments closely. A bottom-up approach is being taken. Many members of local authorities throughout the country were anxious that the Bill be enacted to allow them to proceed as quickly as possible with the preparation of the by-laws, bearing in mind that it will take a month plus seven days after the public consultation process before they can become effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the run-in from September to Christmas to the budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will the Minister be prepared to support local authorities, such as the one in my constituency, Fingal County Council, that request funding to implement the by-laws in respect of certain craft? Will the Minister and the Department support them in administering that because we are talking about somebody in a car on the bank of a river or lake trying to invigilate an operator misbehaving and causing damage to other users of the facility by driving the craft at speed? Will we be able to support good local authorities who bring forward by-laws in response to this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair is in a dilemma, Minister, because you were supposed to come in only twice and you got in three times. Perhaps you will give a brief reply. When we are on Report Stage I prefer that we comply with the Standing Order and we will get more business done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but we are talking about life and death. Beach guards are already in place and I do not anticipate any major additional costs. It will be a matter for local authorities to provide the funding but as requested by the Deputy I will speak to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in due course.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment refers to section 7 and the procedure whereby the authority has made draft by-laws that have been put out for public consultation and the time limit for submissions, which is currently seven days. Given my experience as a public representative &mdash; I am sure the Ceann Comhairle has similar experience &mdash; a very brief period of consultation when one is trying to make a submission in the planning process, such as applies at present, impacts negatively on the public and democracy.</P>
      <P>Seven days is a brief period. It would take some days to find a notice, perhaps on a website, leaving only a few days to make the submission. Even in the current planning system, the period is five weeks, or effectively 27 days with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Like other Deputies, I make such submissions regularly. It is necessary to provide more time. I suggest a period of four weeks rather than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of seven days. Section 7 allows at least one month plus seven days. Deputy Broughan suggested one month and 28 days for the public to comment on draft by-laws proposed to be made under this section by any authority. One month and seven days is ample, particularly if the by-laws need to be made urgently. However, it is not a statutory matter that a local authority may only allow a period of one month and seven days. It is discretionary and it will be a matter for any authority to allow for a longer period. That is the compromise. It would be unreasonable if I was to insist on a period of one month and seven days. I place my faith in the members of the local authorities in respective areas. I hope Deputies will accept this is a compromise.</P>

      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I submitted this amendment on Committee Stage due to concerns on first reading the Bill about the definition of &ldquo;vessel&rdquo;. The definition at section 2(1) of the 1992 Act did not go far enough and section 2 of the Bill seems to rely on the definition of &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; in that Act. The amendment is designed to extend the definition to make it clear that jet skis and other small recreational craft are included. It intends that the definition of &ldquo;vessel&rdquo; would be wide-ranging enough to ensure all the improvements in the Bill would apply to such craft.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 23, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Where a person has a concentration of alcohol in the breath which exceeds the maximum permissible concentration applicable to a person in charge of a motor vehicle, he or she shall be presumed to be under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of properly controlling or operating a vessel or carrying out a task or duty for the purposes of <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a key amendment. I am glad we have a chance to discuss the matter in the short time available. The point of the amendment relates to persons being in charge of water craft while under the influence of alcohol or alcohol products. I am amazed that Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is not present, sought to delete section 28 because the Minister has at least tried to introduce a connection between the wrongful use of alcohol and being in charge of a vessel or pleasure craft.</P>
      <P>Section 28 states:</P>
      <P LI="1">A person being in command or in charge or another member of the crew of a vessel in Irish waters anywhere shall not operate or control or attempt to operate or control the vessel or carry out any task or duty in relation to such operation or control while he or she or the other is under the influence of alcohol or a drug or any combination of drugs or drugs and alcohol . . .</P>
      <P FLI="0">When the Labour Party considered this matter before Second Stage, the key difficulty we identified related to definitions and what instructions the Bill gives the courts and authorised officers who will try to implement it.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>We considered the work of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board &mdash; I commend it for its work since 2002 &mdash; and the series of reports it made into a number of disasters, for example, the collision between the yacht <i>Debonair</i> and the cargo ship <i>Bluebird</i> in 2001, which unfortunately and tragically resulted in the deaths of four people. In light of the board&rsquo;s investigation, there was a strong recommendation in its report concerning the question of setting a maximum blood alcohol level for seafarers in a bid to strongly combat the dangerous role alcohol could play in marine accidents. We might also recall the <i>Marchioness</i> disaster on the Thames some years earlier.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>The Irish Water Safety Association in 2002 stated that alcohol consumption played a role in 37% of water fatalities. Moreover, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board recommended adopting the standard advocated by the International Maritime Organisation, similar to that for driving on land, of 0.08% blood alcohol level, or 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, as a minimum safety measure. The International Maritime Organisation in section B of <Col N="737"/>the 1995 revised International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, STC 78/79, called for all members to adopt this and to prohibit the consumption of alcohol four hours prior to working aboard a vessel.</P>
      <P>The Bill certainly deals with the criminal use of alcohol concerning the people in charge of a vessel, or those carrying out key functions on a vessel. This includes small pleasure craft, but the difficulty is that the Minister of State has not sought to lay down a standard, and that should have been done. The 84 deaths per annum that have occurred are 84 deaths too many and if alcohol played a role in any deaths on water it should be the job of this House to ensure that it does not happen again. We should take a strong line.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>This is the first time we have legislation apart from regulations laid down for masters and mariners regarding important responsibilities on board vessels The maritime safety directorate has consistently pursued this in recent years. Concerning smaller pleasure craft such as jet skis, we should lay down a clear standard. Other jurisdictions have answered the International Maritime Organisation&rsquo;s request, and Ireland, as a maritime, seafaring nation that enjoys the water, should adopt such a standard. This would show that we do not believe that the consumption of alcohol is compatible with being in charge of a vessel. I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is a very important amendment. This was discussed on Committee Stage with regard to zero tolerance of alcohol. We cannot send out a clear enough message about alcohol and drugs. That is crucial. Deputy Broughan and I tabled amendments on this matter and we used the standard set by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for someone driving a vehicle. We should have similar measures on the maximum levels of alcohol. There is a risk of passengers falling overboard and this is what makes it completely different. We have a unique opportunity to send out a clear message. There is a prohibition on operating vessels but there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the way the section is worded. The drunkenness of passengers and crew is a matter on which we need to be clear. Drugs cause as much grief as alcohol and we should have no tolerance whatsoever for them. Anyone who would be tempted to take alcohol and steer a vessel in any capacity with minors on board poses a huge risk.</P>
    </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume there is some misunderstanding here because I will not be soft on alcohol or drugs. In the case of someone operating, assisting or fulfilling the function of watch on a vessel, the clear message from this House is that persons must not be in charge of, or operate, vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Although there is no permissible level, perhaps zero tolerance is the wrong term to use.</P><Col N="738"/>
      <P>These measures cannot be compared with those in the Road Traffic Acts. Totally different environments and sets of circumstances are involved in being at sea or on inland waters and being on the road, and different legislative and enforcement arrangements must apply. <i>Prima facie</i> evidence of a person being under the influence of drugs or alcohol or a combination of the two would be clear from the condition and behaviour of the person concerned. This should quickly alert the crew and others to take prompt action to prevent the loss of life. I agree with Deputy Broughan that 84 deaths are 84 too many.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the marine casualty investigation board, which does excellent work. It presents me with recommendations and reports, which I read, and I am anxious to ensure that the recommendations are implemented. I hope there is some misunderstanding on the part of the Deputies in that there is no permissible level of drink or drugs. I understand the concerns of Deputy Broughan but I ask him to reconsider this. He should take into consideration my belief that the Bill, particularly section 28, is stronger than it would be if I accepted this amendment, which would dilute the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The nub of the matter will come down to a case where the authorised officer has arrested a person after a serious accident, perhaps one where people have lost their lives. What is the objective test? In the case of a road accident we can establish if a person is over the legal limit but the Minister of State is presiding over a situation where there are no limits. Considering the number of users, one could consider the marine environment to be relatively more dangerous than the road. Therefore it is incumbent on the authorities, using the new powers here, to ensure people do not misuse alcohol or drugs while engaged in the pleasurable use of craft and the enjoyment of our natural resources. The Minister should establish an objective test.</P>
      <P>When the Government changes, another Minister may review water safety and this measure would be a development of what the present Minister of State has done. I commend him on including the provisions on this matter in the Bill. It is an area from which people often shy away and ignore. The Minister of State is from a seafaring area, similar to my constituency, and he realises that it is an important issue. He should have set a standard. There are some people who think that there should be no standard for driving and drinking &mdash; in other words, that it should be banned.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that any act consisting of lawful industrial action or lawful conduct in the course of trade union activity by a person on board a vessel shall not constitute an offence under this section or <i>section 31</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P FLI="0">This relates to the prohibitions the Minister has made concerning anyone on board a vessel endangering a craft or taking reckless action under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In this amendment there is the provision for lawful and legal industrial action where workers and their trade union representatives are seeking to put their case strongly. Trade unions or leaders could enter a vessel and represent hard-pressed ferries. We have seen the recent example of Irish Ferries. I recall from the debate on Committee Stage the case of Cork-Swansea ferries. I did not want to endanger those rights and to avoid doubt I mentioned section 31.</P>
      <P>As this is the last chance I will have I refer to the following amendment in the Minister of State&rsquo;s name. It seems to be directed against the scallop fishermen&rsquo;s protest and to try to create a situation where people in the fishing community could not legally protest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this extremely important issue for my constituency and for the people of Wexford. This is more than just an issue, it is an ongoing saga. Overcrowding in Wexford General Hospital has caused enormous frustration, anxiety and concern for the population of Wexford, which is 120,000 people, and the greater hinterland that depends on the hospital&rsquo;s services.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, knows that this saga has been going on for years. Particularly in the past six months, we have seen extraordinary overcrowding with more than 30 <Col N="740"/>patients regularly on trolleys in the accident and emergency unit. On occasion, the accident and emergency unit has closed with ambulances being diverted to Waterford Regional Hospital. On one occasion, to my knowledge, ambulances were sent further afield when Waterford could not accept the diverted patients.</P>
        <P>For the Minister of State&rsquo;s information, Waterford city is almost an hour&rsquo;s drive from Wexford town, and much further &mdash; up to 90 minutes drive &mdash; from parts of County Wexford. This is a critical consideration in accident and emergency cases.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has understood this crisis for a long time. There is an agreement that Wexford General Hospital needs at least 40 additional beds. Some three years ago, it was agreed that because of the urgent nature of the case, 19 beds would be fast tracked. That was to have been done immediately. The sanction for those 19 beds was given in April 2004 by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Unfortunately, however, since then not one jot of progress has been made.</P>
        <P>The people of Wexford have vented their annoyance, anger and frustration in many ways. In February this year, 1,500 people attended a mass meeting in the main street of Wexford town to underscore public concern on this matter.</P>
        <P>I want to make clear to the Minister of State what is required now. While the fast-tracked 19 beds are almost a sop, we want them now. We also want the balance of the 40 beds to be planned and sanctioned. We want a new out-patients&rsquo; department to free up the space currently occupied by out patients to expand the accident and emergency unit so there will be an adequate accident and emergency service in the hospital.</P>
        <P>I understand that, yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, announced a capital allocation. I saw a statement by the Health Service Executive today saying that Wexford General Hospital was on the list of hospitals to be funded under the &euro;2 million to &euro;20 million category. The people of Wexford want absolute clarity on this matter. They have waited well beyond the level of endurance, as have the staff of the hospital who have provided a service above and beyond the call of duty against insurmountable odds on occasion, particularly in the past 12 months. Clarity is required on this issue. I appeal to the Minister of State not to provide vague generalities but to be specific. When will the capital programme commence to build the 19 beds? When will the balance of the 40 beds be provided? Will the money be provided for a new outpatients&rsquo; department to allow an adequate accident and emergency service to be provided in the space currently occupied by outpatients? By any criteria and objective analysis, Wexford General Hospital is a major hospital that should be able to provide a decent service to the 120,000 people of the county, in addition to <Col N="741"/>the large number of visitors to the area during the summer season.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am taking the debate on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The debate relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Responsibility for the provision of services at Wexford General Hospital now rests with the executive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Health and Children is aware of the pressures experienced at Wexford General Hospital. There was an increase of approximately 9% in attendances at the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department between 2001 and 2002, a further increase of 9% between 2002 and 2003, and a 6% increase between 2003 and 2004. Overall admissions to the hospital increased up to 2004.</P>
        <P>Capital funding for the health service is now largely provided through the HSE in line with the capital investment framework 2005-09. This amounts to &euro;564 million in 2005, of which in excess of &euro;250 million will be directed towards the acute sector.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, the T&aacute;naiste announced to the House that she has written to the HSE to convey her agreement to allow for the progression of its capital programme in 2005. The construction of an additional 19 beds at Wexford General Hospital is included in the projects approved under the current capital investment framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is now a matter for the HSE to progress its capital programme as a quickly as possible. The Department will continue to support the executive in its efforts to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services generally and at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s contention that there is an ongoing crisis at Wexford General Hospital. There are strains and pressures, and from time to time patients have been awaiting admission to the accident and emergency department, but not on an ongoing basis.</P>

In the meantime, the <Col N="742"/>results of the audit of processes to be undertaken in ten hospitals nationally this summer can also be applied to hospitals like Wexford General Hospital to improve services to patients in accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten-point plan has been endorsed by the IMO. Provision of additional capacity within the health services has comprehensive support and we are taking a full-systems approach to addressing the service issues in accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter with the T&aacute;naiste via the Minister of State. Rita Nolan was a normal young woman who fell ill shortly after marrying her husband John. The personality disorder from which she suffered made her life difficult. As her condition deteriorated she became an increasing danger to herself and others, and she had to be hospitalised on a semi-permanent basis. This situation was obviously stressful for Rita and her family. That she was an intelligent woman who was lucid for much of the time made her experience even more upsetting and placed an enormous burden on her husband John and their two young sons.</P>
        <P>This stress was nothing, however, compared to the shock and upset caused by Rita&rsquo;s untimely death in St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital last year. Rita Nolan died from an infection in her oesophagus caused by having swallowed the broken top of a coat-hanger two days previously. An inquest into the circumstances surrounding her tragic passing recorded a verdict by misadventure. Although my medical knowledge is limited, I understand that this term is used to describe a situation where the full facts cannot be ascertained, such as verdicts concerning drowning, vomit inhalation, alcohol poisoning and other deaths whose causes are inconclusive. Rita Nolan&rsquo;s case warrants further investigation. Under the Coroners Act 1962, the coroner has the right to summon a medical practitioner to attend an inquest. However, he cannot summon a second doctor unless expressly requested by a majority of a jury, if they are not satisfied with the cause of death. One doctor can explain the cause of death, but it takes all doctors involved to provide a full picture of the circumstances surrounding a death. The two other doctors involved in monitoring Rita did not turn up. Instead, the hospital stuck to the letter of the law and brought its solicitor along to cover its backside.</P>
        <P>We are still awaiting the introduction of the new Coroners Bill, which will provide for increased sanctions for people who refuse to co-operate with the proper conduct of an inquest and will end the restriction on the number of medical and other witnesses that can be called. I await this with great eagerness.</P>
        <P>In Rita&rsquo;s case and under the existing legislation, only one doctor could be called. In this case the doctor on duty on Thursday, 8 April testified that <Col N="743"/>after Rita broke the piece of a coat hanger and swallowed it, he got a torch and a pair of gloves and removed the item. He asked how she was and she replied fine. The next day she complained of throat pain and was administered Panadol by another doctor. No other examination seems to have taken place.</P>
        <P>This was Friday, 9 April. The next day she became increasingly distressed and was administered antibiotics by yet another doctor. She died at 6 p.m. on Saturday evening. The abscess on her throat caused her to choke to death. The autopsy simply stated that a foreign object punctured her oesophagus and it got infected. However, this does not tell the whole story. The coroner was as critical of the hospital in his report as he could be. He was so critical that we need to find out more.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>What needs to be investigated is the information passed between consultants and the procedures and practices in operation at St. Brendan&rsquo;s. Given that Rita had been involved in previous swallowing incidents, including a situation where she swallowed a spoon, which required removal by surgery in a general hospital, would it not have made sense, for example, for a note to be left from one doctor to another. No-one knows if such a note exists, at least nobody concerned with the inquest. Why, for example, was a follow-up X-ray not carried out, given Rita&rsquo;s case history? Her family believes that she would still be alive today if an X-ray had been taken.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>Were any special monitoring instructions given in Rita&rsquo;s case? What exactly happened in terms of follow-up? If someone swallowed a coat hanger, surely some follow-up was needed. Where were the checks and balances? As it was a psychiatric doctor who attended her, what basic medical training did he and others dealing with her have?</P>
        <P>It could well be that nothing untoward happened and that every procedure was carried out properly, or it could be that an unfortunate overworked member or members of staff, or the policy makers in hospital management, are collectively guilty of negligence leading to Rita&rsquo;s death. The family only wants the truth, but the information provided by St. Brendan&rsquo;s has been sparse to date. Only give out what you must seems to be the message that went out. The first time the family had any personal contact from St. Brendan&rsquo;s was a mumbled condolence at the inquest. The family seeks the truth and deserves better.</P>
        <P>Both Rita&rsquo;s family and I as a public representative have nothing but the highest regard for staff in St. Brendan&rsquo;s and all health care staff who work long and dedicated hours in sometimes trying conditions within our creaking health care service. However, we want the truth. What exactly happened? Was it in line with normal practice and was normal practice good enough? Rita has moved on, but her family cannot move on until all the facts of this case are revealed. I urge the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste to use their good offices and order a full investigation <Col N="744"/>into all the facts surrounding Rita Nolan&rsquo;s untimely death.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Gogarty for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The case to which the Deputy referred is a tragic one and I extend my condolences to the family concerned. Every death of a patient is most regrettable.</P>
        <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on any individual case. However, I am aware that, in line with standard practice, the clinical director of St. Brendan&rsquo;s Hospital submitted a report on the circumstances surrounding the death to which Deputy Gogarty referred to the inspector of mental health services. In May 2004 the Mental Health Commission considered this report, dated 27 April 2004. The commission informed my Department that it intends to review the circumstances of this death now that the inquest has been completed.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission is an independent statutory body established under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001. One of the statutory functions of the commission is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services. Towards this end, the commission is currently developing a quality framework for the delivery of our mental health services. This framework includes the development of standards for mental health care, clinical governance and codes of practice. The inspections by the inspectorate of mental health services provide for the ongoing monitoring of such policies and standards by the Mental Health Commission.</P>

	<P>The inspector and the commission will analyse the case. There is no timeframe, but they will do it quickly. As the Deputy is aware, the statutory inspector appointed by the Mental Health Commission, Dr. Teresa Carey, will put her first report before the Oireachtas shortly, probably before the end of this month. Whether she will report on this death is up to her. She is independent and I will receive the report the same time as it is laid before the House. I presume she will inspect this case quickly as possible. I will relay the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about this case to her.</P>

        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs rents the pension services building and the 300 to 400 employees who work in it are strongly against the proposal. The building also houses a cr&egrave;che <Col N="745"/>and Summerhill College and several housing estates are in close proximity to the building. The mast is to be erected as part of a nation-wide roll-out deal the OPW has done with a mobile phone company.</P>
        <P>People in the area are very angry and annoyed by the manner in which this mast has been proposed, and by the lack of consultation with locals and those working in the area. In particular, the lack of consultation astonished the staff of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. They were given very short notice of the proposed erection of the mast.</P>
        <P>There are possible serious health implications from this proposal. It is unfortunate that the OPW can only see euro signs flashing, instead of showing concern for the health of the State&rsquo;s population. It has shown no regard for the level of concern or the annoyance of the people about the proposal. The OPW has suggested that the area would be monitored prior to the mast being erected and that it would also be assessed after the mast has been in place and that if there was a problem, the mast would be removed. This was the message relayed to staff and is an extraordinary proposal. This is not good enough.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s concerns have nothing to do with monitoring the mast. This is quite simply the wrong spot for it. I am particularly disappointed by the OPW. We are not looking for reasons to put this mast on this building. We have definite reasons it should not go up on the building. If the OPW appreciated the civil servants working in the adjoining areas, it would take their concerns on board. Health implications from such masts have been well documented and it is ridiculous to suggest this building is a suitable location for the mast.</P>
        <P>The OPW seems to have little regard for public finances. In today&rsquo;s newspapers we read how it has miscalculated costs and abused taxpayers&rsquo; money. Does it suggest that we should put the mast up, forgive the huge expense involved and risk serious damage to health, only to take it back down again in a matter of weeks? That is the current proposal, but it does not stand up to examination and lacks credibility. As we all know, the OPW has not got a great track record when it comes to putting the State first. The Committee of Public Accounts, which I chaired up until recent months, today gave the tally of OPW blunders and miscalculations involving taxpayers moneys.</P>
        <P>These figures are staggering. The waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money is simply disgraceful. The OPW has made it obvious that it cannot be trusted to take important decisions. While the OPW has made progress, it is clear that it is still keen to get a quick buck. When one considers that it spent &euro;19 million on unused accommodation for asylum seekers, one can appreciate the OPW&rsquo;s justification for seeking rent from mobile telephone companies.</P>
        <P>When the OPW acquired an office for the probation and welfare service in a shopping centre in <Col N="746"/>Dublin, it agreed to pay rent of &euro;150,000 per annum. That amounted to &euro;11.50 per square foot, which was almost double the going rate. The OPW spent a further &euro;1.5 million, or ten times the original estimate, on fitting out the office, which stayed empty for three years. I suggest that such examples are akin to something from a television comedy were it not for the fact that they are terribly tragic rather than funny.</P>
        <P>The OPW is responsible for signing the contract to install the mast on the pension service office in Sligo. It is understandable that locals have voiced their opposition to the location of the mast, especially when one considers the track record and credibility of the OPW. I would like the exact details of the level of income that will be received as rent by the OPW from the mobile telephone company in question. Given that the OPW has constantly shown a lack of common sense and demonstrated utter recklessness with taxpayers&rsquo; money, I understand the annoyance of local people. I would like details of the contract the OPW has agreed with the mobile telephone company so that I can gather full knowledge of why it is so keen to pursue this deal.</P>
        <P>It is unthinkable that the OPW is considering the installation of the mast without proper consultation with locals. The proposal is distressing for the hundreds of staff employed in the office, who have held a public meeting about the matter. There is a clear level of dissatisfaction with the unions. I appeal to the Minister of State to take note of the frustration in this regard. When one is investing money, one must remember that one&rsquo;s staff are one&rsquo;s key allies. I refer in this instance to highly competent civil servants who are frustrated and annoyed by the lack of consideration being given to their concerns.</P>
        <P>The proposed location of the mast is unsuitable. I ask the Government to reconsider the deal that has been reached. The decision to erect the mast must be reversed in light of the total objection to it in Sligo. I hope the Minister of State will give me some positive news this evening. Given that our economy is booming and the Government has millions of euro to spend, I refuse to believe that the Exchequer needs the small amount of rent that will be received from the mast. It is possible that the additional funds which will accrue to the OPW will be misused and misappropriated as they have been in the past.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of Public Works has direct responsibility for the management of the State&rsquo;s property portfolio. One of its objectives is to ensure that the property portfolio is used in an optimum way in the interests of the State and the taxpayer. In that context, the OPW is trying to extract maximum value from the State&rsquo;s property assets. That involves the granting of licences to telecommunications companies to install communications equipment on a range of State properties in return for an agreed level of fees.</P><Col N="747"/>
        <P>A standard licence agreement has been agreed on foot of negotiations with telecommunications companies. The licence agreement sets out the terms and conditions under which such companies will be allowed to install equipment on State properties. A mobile telephone operator that is granted such a licence will be required to comply with the relevant Health and Safety Acts, operate within current standards and EU regulations and adhere to guidelines on exposure limits to emissions issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP. The compliance with health and safety legislation that is required under the licence agreement also applies to future relevant legislation and regulation and the ICNIRP guidelines. Consultants appointed by the OPW will conduct checks on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with the standards. Licensees will be required to comply fully with normal planning regulations.</P>
        <P>The OPW signed a licence agreement with a mobile telephone operator, Vodafone Ireland Limited, on 13 April 2005 for the erection of mobile communication antenna on the State-owned pensions services office at College Road, Sligo. The OPW-appointed telecommunications consultants, Vilicom, have met representatives of the staff of the pensions services office. It has been agreed that emissions readings will be taken before and after installation of the new communication equipment as part of the monitoring process, to ensure that the relevant standards are maintained. I assure the Deputy that the strict framework for the installation of telecommunications equipment on the pensions services office building at College Road, Sligo, will be fully respected.</P>

	<P>I am sure the matter I propose to discuss on the Adjournment is of concern to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. He does not need to be worried, but the food division of Enterprise Ireland will feel embarrassed when I tell my story. The Minister visited Mitchelstown, which has been devastated by the stroke of one man, Mr. Jerry Henchy, last year and again yesterday. Mr. Henchy has destroyed the cheese and bacon industries in Mitchelstown, which is the home of good cheese. It has been known throughout the world since the 1930s for its developments and activities in the cheese sector.</P>
        <P>The Minister announced during his visit to Mitchelstown yesterday that Dairygold proposes to develop a research and development centre there. The proposed centre might not help to solve the town&rsquo;s problems. I am 62 years of age and even though I might spend another seven or ten years in the House, I am sure I will never see the fruits of the &euro;15.6 million that is being invested in the research and development centre. Many organisations throughout the country are <Col N="748"/>engaged in an ongoing process of research and development.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has many questions to answer. Its food division recommended the closure of the slaughter facility at Galtee Foods and the transfer of the slaughter operation to Glanbia in County Kilkenny. While there is nothing wrong with Glanbia as an organisation, it has not been in the packing business and does not have a brand to compare with Dairygold&rsquo;s Galtee Meats brand, which is well known in this country and Britain. Ideally, the same company that rears pigs and poultry packs them and sells them to the consumer. In such circumstances, consumers can enjoy guarantees of traceability and quality. Danish Crown, a major processing company in Denmark, has a number of secondary packing operations. The Hormel Foods Corporation is involved in the exact same business in the United States. A co-op in Spain is involved in its own branding, slaughtering and traceability. That is the way forward for all industries in the food sector.</P>
        <P>Dairygold is known as a commodity buyer throughout the world, whereas Glanbia is known as a commodity seller. Dairygold has no fresh product. There are secondary processors in Denmark, as I have said. They are involved in the slaughterhouses in that country. The two secondary processors in Ireland &mdash; Kerry Group and Galtee Meats &mdash; are buying product throughout the world. Although Irish pigs are the cheapest in Europe, if not the world, Kerry Group and Galtee Foods prefer to buy cheaper cuts and inferior product from other areas.</P>
        <P>The hog industry in the US kills and packs its produce on site because it understands that consumers want freshness. The research and development sector of Enterprise Ireland should have examined the feasibility of such a system in this country before it recommended the closure of the slaughter operation at Galtee Foods and the doubling of the line in Glanbia. It should have doubled the level of output at Galtee Foods because that company enjoyed a significant share of the consumer market.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has almost destroyed the Irish pig industry, which is in crisis. It does not have enough pig-slaughtering facilities, as I said, and it does not have enough markets for the commodities it is producing. The problems in the sugar beet industry, which we have discussed on many occasions, are found throughout the world as a result of the actions of organisations like WTO and arrangements like GATT. The problems in the Irish pig sector have arisen because the industry has been destroyed by Enterprise Ireland, which is a State agency. No grant aid should be paid to secondary processors. All grant aid should be channelled to Glanbia so that it can establish a brand, based on the fresh product in its factory, that is recognised by the housewife. It needs to be able to go right to the marketplace.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to make a decision to disband the food section of Enterprise Ireland, <Col N="749"/>which is going nowhere, before it destroys the Irish food industry. The food division does not know what it is doing because if it had conducted a feasibility study or a market survey, it would have found out quite easily that it was going in the wrong direction. Moy Park is in the poultry business in Northern Ireland. That company has its own growers, markets and brands and it is not a secondary processor. The same has happened to the poultry industry in southern Ireland. I am a member of a Government and a party, which believe in employment and good farming practices, but that cannot happen where agencies are out to destroy what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P>I am totally annoyed, disgruntled and upset by what has happened to Dairygold in my town and in Mallow by a chief executive, Jerry Henchy, who digs holes every day with jackboot tactics, subjecting his employees to a procedure that has never been seen on the island of Ireland. It is time this was stopped. The company has employed a manager who would shoot the wounded to get rid of them. These are the tactics being used against my constituents. This is the first time I have made such an outburst. I want this corrected and I want this behaviour towards the employees of the company to stop. I also want the policy of spending taxpayers&rsquo; money on research and development to stop because it is being spent foolishly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of providing replacement jobs in Mitchelstown, County Cork. I have visited Mitchelstown on a number of occasions since I took up office to assist the town and its hinterland in its economic future and in creating new opportunities for its people by providing jobs in a diverse range of sectors.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s principal remit is to assist the development of Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors. The agency cannot provide jobs but rather can help companies grow by providing funding and advice. It provides this through its business development model, which helps to ensure all business functions of a client are addressed. A company is unlikely to succeed unless it has strength in marketing, research and development, finance, business strategy, production and human resources. El&rsquo;s offer is demand driven in that clients apply to the agency for assistance. The agency cannot push solutions on to clients; the relationship is a partnership, which seeks to accommodate the best interests of the client and the State.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is also seeking to improve its work with clients. In May, EI&rsquo;s new strategy, entitled Transforming Irish Industry, was launched. The strategy is focused on implementing the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish-owned business in the manufacturing sector and internationally traded services sector. A new productivity <Col N="750"/>improvement fund, which will be managed by Enterprise Ireland, was also launched. Over the next 18 months, the fund will make available up to &euro;17 million to eligible SME clients to enable companies adopt advanced technology and focus on skill developments to improve their competitive position.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland continues to work with companies in its portfolio in County Cork and in the south-west region to assist them expand their sales and exports and improve innovation so that they can compete on world markets. With regard to job creation, the agency&rsquo;s activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>In 2004 Enterprise Ireland invested more than &euro;9 million in its client companies in County Cork, of which &euro;1.53 million, an increase from &euro;750,000 in 2003, was for client companies in the Cork east area. This investment was primarily in support of new business employment, research and development, capital investment and staff training. Enterprise Ireland payments to companies in County Cork for 2004 amounted to &euro;5.57 million, of which &euro;500,000 went to companies in the east Cork area. EI works with just under 750 client companies in County Cork, which, according to the Forf&aacute;s Annual Employment Survey 2004, employ a total of 19,617 people. This reflects an increase of 122 jobs on the 2003 figure. As part of its role in regional development, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional office in Cork works with other regional organisations and agencies in the county to develop the business infrastructure and to influence the conditions in which organic growth in the region is established and sustained.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland works on an ongoing basis with Ballyhoura Development Group. Funding was provided for the group for a food enterprise centre on the industrial estate in Mitchelstown under the community enterprise centre scheme 2002. Ballyhoura Development Group obtained approval for this new food business incubator to be co-funded through the business expansion scheme in December 2004 and the project is at planning stage. A major study is also being conducted in the Mitchelstown area to chart the way forward socially and economically for the town and Enterprise Ireland has supported that initiative.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I announced the establishment by Dairygold Co-operative of a dedicated &euro;15 million research and development facility in Mitchelstown. The bulk of the funding will be provided by Dairygold and significant funding amounting to &euro;4 million will be advanced by Enterprise Ireland, which will focus on functional food research and the development of new products for the consumer foods sector. This will be a significant multi-billion euro sector going for<Col N="751"/>ward. This proposal represents a major step in the company&rsquo;s research and development capability, helping it to reduce its dependence on commodity products. It will greatly assist the company in its objective of becoming a leading producer of higher margin, added value, chilled food projects and functional food and ingredients.</P>
        <P>The research and development facility will lead to the creation of high quality employment for 15 graduates in food sciences, three of which will be to PhD level, with the remaining 12 to masters and BSc levels. The development will double Dairygold&rsquo;s research and development staff from 15 to 30. Ultimately, the centre will have capacity for a total of 50 personnel. It is expected this will be reached post-2007. The new centre will incorporate a highly specialised pilot plant facility. The aim is to ensure the maximum potential is derived from applied research both in terms of new business establishment and technology transfer. This will be facilitated through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s links with third level institutions and industry, including Moorepark in Fermoy.</P>
        <P>As a result of Enterprise Ireland investment in research and development in the Kepak plant in Watergrasshill, on 13 June 2005 I announced the <Col N="752"/>company&rsquo;s plans for a major expansion into heat and serve added value range of meat products. This includes beef, pork, chicken, lamb and turkey and is targeted at the food service and retail markets. The proposed &euro;25 million funding includes fixed asset investment as well as marketing, research and development and HRD investment. The planned investment will result in an increase in sales of &euro;55 million and employment by 155, bringing the total projected jobs on site to 450.</P>
        <P>I will address the issues raised by the Deputy with Enterprise Ireland. However, investment in research and development is the key for the future success not only of the food industry but of the economy generally. The number of value added products must be increased. Whatever are the issues regarding other sectors of Dairygold or decisions made by the company, they should not be used to attack a bona fide and interesting development in investment in research and development at the plant.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care, including radiotherapy, to cancer patients. The Government is therefore determined to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards. The immediate developments at Cork and Galway have resulted in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. Two additional linear accelerators are being provided at Cork University Hospital, CUH. The first of these linear accelerators was fully commissioned in March and the second is expected to be commissioned by the autumn. Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at CUH with sessional commitments to the south-eastern and the mid-western areas. The new radiotherapy department at University College Hospital Galway began treating patients in March. These developments will significantly improve access to radiotherapy for patients in the south-east and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The report recommends that there should be two radiotherapy treatment centres located in the eastern area. The international panel established to advise on the optimum locations for these centres has submitted its advice to me. I will make my decision in relation to this matter shortly, having heard many valid points of view on it from interested and committed parties all <Col N="754"/>of whom share our priority to build radiotherapy services through top class clinical networks.</P>
        <P>The national radiation oncology co-ordinating group is currently developing a national telesynergy network for radiation oncology services. Arrangements are being made to install this technology at Waterford Regional Hospital. This will improve linkages with Cork University Hospital and St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin and reduce patient and consultant travel time.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s part of the country, I will be meeting the Minister for Health of Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, shortly and I have asked that North-South co-operation on cancer services be put on the agenda. The Government is as committed to delivering safe and effective cancers services for the people of Donegal and Waterford as we are for people in every county.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the concern expressed at the recent INO conference in Killarney that the health and safety of patients and staff in hospitals and long-term units for the elderly was being put at risk due to a failure to address dangerously low staffing levels; the steps being taken to address this situation and to ensure that adequate staff numbers are provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly safe and effective delivery of services is of primary concern to me. I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s assertion that staffing levels in hospitals and long-term care units for the care of the elderly settings are at dangerously low levels. I am aware for example that the Irish ratio of nurses to the population is much higher than the ratio found in other developed countries. Work currently being carried out for my Department by F&Aacute;S suggests that we have 12.2 working nurses per 1,000 people, about 50% more than the EU average of 8.5. The Government has increased the number of nurses &mdash; whole-time equivalents &mdash; by 7,000 since 1999.</P>
        <P>I fully support the principle that an appropriate level of service should be provided to patients across the country based on need. However, patients&rsquo; needs vary considerably depending on the particular care being provided, the acuity of patients or their level of dependency. The Health Service Executive and the National Hospitals Office will need reliable evidence to establish best practice in the range of settings provided by the health services.</P>
        <P>These matters must be dealt with through the correct deployment of staff, through appropriate skill mix and by making sure that the legislation is in place to provide proper regulation.</P>
        <P>The deployment of staff is a matter for the Health Service Executive. However, this is a major policy issue in which my Department will <Col N="755"/>also take a keen interest. The National Hospitals Office has already begun the process of reviewing all services at each hospital to ensure that they are staffed appropriately to deliver safe and good quality care. The Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has acknowledged that the hospitals are fully engaged in the process of addressing health and safety in their accident and emergency units. The HSA has also made clear its intention to carry out safety audits on other health care settings and I welcome this.</P>
        <P>I accept that there are concerns about services for older people and I share these concerns. That is why I have made a commitment that the Social Services Inspectorate is to be established on a statutory basis and legislation to give effect to this will be published later this year. The inspectorate will be charged with the inspection of both public and private nursing homes and will be responsible for reporting on standards of care in such homes. It is planned to extend the brief of the Social Services Inspectorate to include residential services for older people and people with a disability.</P>
        <P>The staff levels set for nursing homes are in accordance with the Nursing Homes Regulations 1993. However, having regard to the level of public concern currently about the registration and inspection of the nursing home sector, it is imperative that immediate action is taken to ensure that current systems and processes are as robust as they possibly can be within the context of the current regulations. Responsibility for the inspection and registration of the nursing home section has been assigned to a senior manager, within the national primary, community and continuing care directorate of the Health Service Executive from 15 June 2005. Steps are being taken to evaluate current procedures, and to agree and oversee the implementation of a national standardised inspection process and provide a progress report by 5 September 2005. A review has already commenced in the HSE-eastern region and this will be included in the national evaluation. Any recommendations arising from this in respect of the amendment of legislation or regulation will be addressed.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is urgently reviewing the operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and regulations made under the Act to strengthen the powers available to the Health Service Executive. This will be a wide-ranging review which will have the rights of the patient as the centre of its work. Again it is my intention to have this Bill published later on this year so that we can have an early debate will all stakeholders on a new framework for all patients in nursing homes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">In recent years there has been a considerable expansion in training places for three therapy professions &mdash; speech and language, physiotherapy and occupational therapy &mdash; in line with the report commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists. As the Deputy has said, this expansion includes an additional 75 training places in occupational therapy.</P>
        <P>My Department established a national planning group in 2004 to develop a co-ordinated national approach on clinical placement provision. Following on from the work of this group, and building on earlier support provided in 2003, &euro;2.427 million was provided by my Department in 2004 to support the provision of clinical placements for these three therapy professions. Focus has been on securing increased quality clinical placements for the additional training places and for the pre-existing places.</P>
        <P>A national implementation group has recently been established by the Health Service Executive to progress the delivery of key actions identified by the national planning group and to make recommendations for appropriate adjustments and re-prioritisations, based on practical experience derived from putting the framework into effect. My Department is co-chairing this implementation group with the Health Service Executive in the initial stages.</P>
        <P>As my Department does not have an operational function in regard to the organisation of clinical placements for individual students, the Health Service Executive &mdash; which has responsibility for this matter &mdash; has therefore been asked to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 117, 218 and 219 together.</P>
        <P>The Rheumatology Manpower Report 2002 produced by the Irish Society of Rheumatology, ISR, identified deficits in the provision of rheumatology services nationally. The ISR report noted that the number of rheumatologists per head of population in Ireland was low in comparison with other European countries. At the time the ISR report was published there were 16 whole-time equivalent, WTE, consultant rheumatologists in place. According to the National Hospitals Office-Comhairle figures, there are now 21.5 WTE posts. This equates to a 33% increase in the number of posts in the space of three years.</P>
        <P>The further expansion of rheumatology is now the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. My Department will continue to support the executive in its efforts to improve the delivery of rheumatology services.</P>
        <P>Rheumatology services in the Health Service Executive south-western area are currently provided at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and at the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin incorporating the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, AMINCH. The AMINCH historically had two sessions of a consultant rheumatology post shared with St. James&rsquo;s. However, this arrangement ceased on the replacement of one of the two full-time rheumatologist posts in St. James&rsquo;s leaving the AMINCH without a formal service for a short period.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the need for the service and growing waiting lists for appointments, the former Eastern Regional Health Authority approved the appointment of a new consultant rheumatologist and support staff for the AMINCH in November of 2004. Interviews for the post took place at the end of April 2005 and my Department has been informed that the successful candidate is due to commence in December 2005. A locum consultant is currently in place at the hospital pending the appointment of the permanent post holder. This new post will be shared between the AMINCH and Naas General Hospital where an outpatient and ward consultation service will be provided for those living in the area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The working hours of doctors in training are regulated by way of the European Communities (Organisation of Working Time) (Activities of Doctors in Training) Regulations 2004, which came into operation on 1 August 2004.</P>
        <P>Employers and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, have been engaged over a lengthy period in discussions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, in order to advance proposals to effect a reduction in the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs. While some progress has been made, much remains to be resolved. The LRC has requested that both parties refrain from engaging in any form of unilateral action for the duration of the negotiation process. As a result, health employers have not acted unilaterally in order to achieve full compliance with the European working time directive, EWTD.</P>
        <P>My Department has no knowledge of any actions taken or fines imposed on any health employer in the State for breaches of the directive in respect of NCHDs. In many hospitals, the introduction of new rosters would facilitate significant progress towards EWTD compliance while maintaining safe patient care and existing levels of service. However, health employers, in response to the request of the LRC, are at present awaiting agreement at national level before proceeding.</P>
        <P>The ability of the Health Service Executive, HSE, to effectively implement the EWTD for the benefit of all NCHDs is dependent on the full co-operation of the IMO at both national and local level. In that regard, agreement was reached with the IMO in late 2004 to the establishment of nine pilot sites. The work by the local implementation groups at these sites is progressing with a view to developing plans for the full implementation of the directive.</P>
        <P>Each local group includes consultants, local representatives of training bodies, NCHDs, nurses, management and other grades. Arising from their work, action can be taken when the industrial relations issues have been resolved.</P>
        <P>The groups recently completed a comprehensive data gathering exercise on hospital activity, based on a similar UK &ldquo;Hospital at Night&rdquo; project. Over 50,000 clinical tasks were captured in <Col N="759"/>the exercise. This data will help to determine how to reorganise services over a 24-hour day to maintain high quality patient care and provide appropriate training opportunities while achieving EWTD compliance. An analysis of the data is currently being conducted by the University of York and a report will be presented to all parties in the negotiations on 6 July 2005, at a meeting chaired by the LRC.</P>
        <P>A national implementation group chaired by Dr. Cillian Twomey is being established under the auspices of the LRC. The group&rsquo;s membership includes nominees from the HSE, the IMO, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board, the Medical Council, the postgraduate medical training colleges, representatives of nurses and other health care professions and officials from the Department of Health and Children. This national group will co-ordinate the work of the nine local groups, issue agreed guidance on EWTD implementation and assist in the development of local implementation plans.</P>
        <P>Further negotiations on issues relating to industrial relations matters are continuing in the LRC, aided and informed by the information compiled by the local groups. I am hopeful that early progress can be made in resolving outstanding issues so that full implementation of the directive&rsquo;s requirements can proceed without further delay.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 87, 164, 170 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is advancing the implementation of a series of measures to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services funded from the &euro;70 million current funding that was made available in the Estimates for 2005. Some of the specific projects now approved include: a new accident and emergency unit at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin; a new 25 bed accident and emergency admissions unit for the Mater Hospital; the completion of an accident and emergency unit in Portlaoise; a minor injury unit and a chest pain unit at Waterford Regional Hospital; a minor injury unit at St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Limerick; and a medical assessment unit and soft tissue trauma clinic at Cork University Hospital.</P>
        <P>A detailed process mapping exercise is being conducted in advance of final decisions being taken on the provision of acute medical units at Tallaght, St. Vincent&rsquo;s and Beaumont hospitals. Tenders to undertake this exercise at ten hospitals nationally have been received by the HSE and are being evaluated at present. This hospital-by-hospital work to improve procedures in order to speed up patient services at accident and emergency departments has proved successful in the UK.</P>
        <P>In relation to the provision of more appropriate care for older people who have completed the acute phase of their treatment, the following steps have been taken: 74 public intermediate-long stay beds are to be opened; 38 beds have been contracted for high dependency patients in the eastern region, to date a total of ten patients have been transferred from acute hospitals in the region; an initial 65 intermediate care beds were sourced under the tendering process for the eastern region and to date 95 patients has been discharged through those beds; in Cork, 30 intermediate beds were sourced under the tendering process and to date 36 patients have been discharged to these beds; 87 older people and eight young chronic disabled persons have been discharged through home-care supports; and an additional six palliative care beds have been commissioned in Blackrock Hospice.</P><Col N="761"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
        <P>Other measures under way include the following: a national audit of cleanliness in hospitals, to be undertaken by external consultants, will take place in July and August this year; funding has been provided to hospitals in the HSE-southern area for direct access to private diagnostic services; and in relation to broader range of GP direct access diagnostic services it has been agreed that the HSE will explore entering into local arrangements with the private sector to match capacity with needs.</P>
        <P>In addition to these approvals, the HSE has asked each hospital network to: undertake a detailed analysis of patient throughput in each hospital; review existing practices to match staffing and other resources to peak patient attendance times; ensure efficient bed management and discharge planning to improve throughput; and promptly implement accident and emergency escalation plans when there is a significant surge in demand for accident and emergency services.</P>

	<P>I would be saddened if any woman would chose to have a mastectomy rather than travelling to receive the best care available.</P>
        <P>Patients in the north-west requiring radiation oncology are currently being referred to the recently commissioned radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, and also to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin. A consultant radiation oncologist with significant sessional commitments to the north-western area has recently been appointed to UCHG. In addition, further discussions are scheduled to take place later this month between the HSE north-western area and Belfast City Hospital in regard to access to radiation oncology services for patients in the north-west &mdash; mainly Donegal. I will be meeting the Northern Ireland Minister for Health and Children on 5 July in Dublin to discuss this and other matters. My Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive to advise the Deputy of progress on these discussions. The state of the art facility at Belfast City Hospital is scheduled to open in early 2006.</P>

	<P>I am happy to be able to report that almost all of the issues which needed to be resolved with consultants arising from the establishment of the clinical indemnity scheme, CIS, have now been dealt with.</P>
        <P>The only remaining issue is a demand from the consultants that the caps placed on the limits of indemnity which consultants need to purchase to cover private practice not covered by the CIS should be halved. Most consultants currently need to purchase indemnity cover for the first &euro;1 million of each and every claim against them. Consultant obstetricians purchase cover for the first &euro;500,000 of each and every claim with an aggregate limit of indemnity of &euro;1.5 million in any one year. I am satisfied that these limits put in place in February 2004 struck a reasonable balance between the amount of risk which consultants should bear compared to that taken on by the State. This view was endorsed by the Labour Court last December. However, the Labour Court also recommended that an independent actuarial review of the caps should be undertaken at the end of 2005. To that end the firm of Lane, Clark and Peacock, consulting actuaries to my Department and to the CIS, has been asked to assess the adequacy of the existing caps and to report on the implications of including claims against consultant neurosurgeons and consultant orthopaedic surgeons who undertake spinal surgery in the lower &euro;500,000 cap. I expect to have their report before the end of July.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year the Government indicated that it would consider supporting individual consultants who had been left without cover by the Medical Defence Union in challenging these decisions by the MDU. Last month I instructed <Col N="763"/>the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office to apply to the High Court for an order joining the MDU as third party in proceedings between a health board and a former consultant member of the MDU where the MDU had withdrawn assistance. The court granted the order sought and formal notice of this has now been served on the MDU. A similar order was recently granted in respect of a second consultant obstetrician who had been refused assistance by the MDU. I understand that similar applications on behalf of a further group of consultants are at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 70, 95 and 135 together.</P>
        <P>The most recent report from the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994-2001, highlights an annual percentage change in the age standardised rate of prostate cancer of 6.5% over the period. During the period 1994 to 2000, prostate cancer incidence rates increased in the Republic of Ireland but not in Northern Ireland, while mortality from prostate cancer did not change in either region. The findings have stimulated a cross-Border investigation by the registry into prostate cancer incidence and screening. The new project aims to explore the reasons for these different trends.</P>
        <P>A new national cancer strategy is currently being finalised by the National Cancer Forum, a multidisciplinary group of experts in oncology. As part of this work, the forum has reviewed all <Col N="764"/>issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The forum has also developed criteria against which all future screening programmes will be assessed.</P>
        <P>In regard to screening for prostate cancer, I understand that the forum will recommend that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country. This issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised control trials currently being conducted internationally.</P>
        <P>This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country. Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</P>

	<P>On 3 May last, the Government approved the appointment of Dr. Deirdre Madden, BL., to complete a report on post mortem practice and organ retention by 21 December 2005. Dr. Madden has been reading herself into the brief over the last few weeks. I will be meeting her shortly to finalise her terms of reference, which I will then present to Government for approval.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not currently have specific legislation governing organ procurement and transplantation. The European Commission is currently considering the question of a directive in respect of organ transplantation, including the issue of consent, and proposes to conduct a thorough scientific evaluation of the situation. It will present a report on its analysis to the Council of the European Union. It is hoped that this will provide the framework for the development of legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the Department will undertake an analysis of the possible legislative needs <Col N="765"/>governing donor procurement and transplantation, with particular reference to the existing legal framework in other jurisdictions.</P>

        <P>Work has been under way in my Department on the proposal to deliver 850 community nursing unit beds through a public private partnership, PPP, and the work that has been done so far has helped to clarify a number of issues. My Department has been examining public private partnerships, PPP, and other procurement options in line with Government policy with a view to finding the approach that will deliver additional long stay beds and provide the best services and value for money to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>In this regard there have been discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance on an initiative which is based on entering into a medium-term service level agreement with the private sector to deliver the additional long stay beds required to relieve pressure on the acute hospitals and community care programme.</P>
        <P>I am pursuing this initiative with the Minister for Finance as a matter of high priority with a view to agreeing that the proposal be developed further to evaluate its cost effectiveness.</P>

	<P>Arrangements for public hospital services were introduced in June 1991. These determined that everyone in the country, regardless of income is entitled to public hospital and public consultant services subject only to modest statutory charges. Medical card holders are exempt from these charges. Any person can also opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. In these circumstances the patient, regardless of whether he or she is a medical card holder, is liable for the costs of such treatment. Neither the Department of Health and Children nor the Health Service Executive is in a position to provide financial assistance in these circumstances. The position regarding consultant fees for privately arranged health care is that the level of fees is a private matter between the consultants concerned and those patients in receipt of their services.</P>
        <P>However, the introduction of the national treatment purchase fund has ensured treatment being made available for 30,000 public patients so far who might otherwise have felt they had no option but to arrange for private treatment. I would encourage any public patient who is waiting for elective surgery for more than three months to contact the NTPF first to see if treatment can be arranged before taking out loans that may be difficult to repay in their financial circumstances.</P>

	<P>The assessment of eligibility for medical cards is a function of the Health Service Executive. Reasonable child care expenses will be taken into account in revised eligibility assessment guidelines for medical cards due to be issued shortly. These guidelines will be publicised by the HSE in the coming week.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to precisely estimate the number of persons who will benefit from this initiative but a working figure of 18,000-20,000 persons is currently assumed.</P>
        <P>The inclusion of reasonable child care expenses is part of a number of significant improvements to the eligibility assessment system that will be implemented shortly by the executive. These include: assessments will be based on disposable income; reasonable rent and mortgage costs allowed in full; and reasonable costs of travel to work allowed in full.</P>
        <P>The eligibility assessment system will be kept under continuous review to ensure that this is targeted to meet the need of persons-families on low incomes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 173 and 205 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing &mdash; the Hanly report &mdash; makes important proposals for reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in line with the European working time directive and highlights the need to implement changes in medical staffing to ensure safety and quality of patient care.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with the Health Service Executive and other health agencies with a view to achieving the required reductions in the working hours of junior doctors. Negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation in this regard are continuing. Local implementation groups have been established in nine hospitals as part of an agreed process and a detailed hospital activity analysis is under way which will inform reforms in this area.</P>
        <P>The report recommends a significant increase in the total number of consultants, working in a consultant-provided, team-based system, so that patients can receive faster access to senior clinical decision making. While consultant contract negotiations are delayed pending resolution of issues related to medical indemnity arrangements, sig<Col N="771"/>nificant preparatory work has been undertaken within my Department in partnership with the Health Service Executive in preparation for the commencement of negotiations.</P>
        <P>The implications of the report for postgraduate medical education and training are being examined by the medical education and training group that was originally established as part of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing.</P>
        <P>In regard to the organisation of hospital services, I consider that the National Hospitals Office is best placed to build on the recommendations of the report in this area. The priority is to ensure that patients, wherever they live, have equitable and rapid access to high quality hospital care.</P>

	<P>Fluoridation of public water supplies as a public health measure is accepted as being one of the most effective methods of ensuring against tooth decay. The World Health Organisation, WHO, recommends fluoridation of public water supplies and has stated that &ldquo;fluoridation of water supplies, where possible, is the most effective public health measure for the prevention of dental decay&rdquo;. The WHO has also stated that &ldquo;people of all ages, including the elderly, benefit from community water fluoridation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The recently completed survey of oral health, covering the whole island of Ireland, shows that fluoridation of public water supplies continues to be a highly effective public health measure. It has contributed significantly to a major reduction in the incidence of dental decay in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a forum on fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum report&rsquo;s main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>In all, the report of the forum on fluoridation made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, policy and technical aspects of fluoridation and the establishment of an expert body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Irish expert body on fluorides and health held its inaugural meeting in April 2004. The terms of reference of the expert body are: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the <Col N="772"/>Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his-her request or on its own initiative.</P>
        <P>The expert body has broad representation, including from the areas of public health medicine, engineering, management, environmental protection, environmental health, dentistry and health promotion. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the body has a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests, in addition to the necessary scientific, managerial and public health inputs. The expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 179 to 189, inclusive, 247 to 250, inclusive, 257 to 266, inclusive, 268, 275 to 281, inclusive, 284 to 292, inclusive, and 319 to 323, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have seen the report which the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned from Dr. Ronnie Pollock. The report confirms that Ireland <Col N="778"/>has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world. It reviewed existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards and concluded that the services available for persons with cystic fibrosis in this country are not of the standard that they should be.</P>
        <P>The report provides an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients. It makes recommendations with regard to the numbers and categories of staff who are appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service. Following publication of the report, the Health Service Executive, at the request of the Cystic Fibrosis Association, established a working group to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland, both in hospitals and in the community. The working group is also to make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services.</P>
        <P>The working group is multidisciplinary in its composition and includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association. It held its first meeting in early April and I understand that it hopes to complete its work over the next few months. The Pollock report is one of a number of reports relating to cystic fibrosis services being considered by the group. The work of the group will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I will be glad to meet with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and the HSE to discuss the development and reconfiguration of services for persons with cystic fibrosis when the working group has finalised its proposals.</P>

	<P>The 2004 revised determinations for all health boards, after adjustment is made for the national PPARS project, totalled &euro;8,169.398 million. The net expenditure reported by health boards for 2004, per the unaudited annual financial statements, AFS, is &euro;8,195.792 million.</P>
        <P>Under the 1996 accountability legislation, health boards were required to transfer a deficit or a surplus for the preceding year to the following year. The cumulative surplus brought forward by health boards at 31 December 2003 totalled &euro;30.786 million. Accordingly, health boards included a surplus or deficit, whichever was appropriate, in their planned spending for 2004. This gave a total available spending level for 2004 of &euro;8,200.184 million. When this is compared to <Col N="779"/>the net non-capital expenditure of &euro;8,195.792 million reported in the unaudited Annual Financial Statements for 2004, the overall position for all <Col N="780"/>health boards at end 2004 is a cumulative surplus of &euro;4.392 million.</P>
        <P>The position in respect of each health board is set out in the following table.</P><Col N="779"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 128, 174 and 190 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that I have appointed Professor Brendan Drumm as the first chief executive of the Health Service Executive, following his recommendation by the board of the executive. Professor Drumm will take up duty on 15 August 2005 and, in the meantime, Mr. Kevin Kelly will remain as interim chief executive.</P><Col N="780"/>
        <P>The final transition from the previous health board structure to the single, unified, national health service took place on 15 June 2005 as planned when the executive&rsquo;s national directors took over full operational responsibility from the chief officers of the former health boards. The transition to one single, streamlined structure, under one management, has been completed and we are at the beginning of an important new phase in the health reform programme.</P>
        <P>The filling of the position of chief executive required two separate recruitment campaigns and I am advised by the executive that total recruitment costs came to &euro;186,352.92.</P>

        <Quest>if her Department has records of correspondence from any acute hospital or health board regarding the implementation of guidelines of 1995 to control the spread of MRSA; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>My Department undertook a search of the available files dealing with the issue of MRSA as a result of the Deputy&rsquo;s question. From this initial search of the files it was not possible in the time available to identify any correspondence on file from any acute hospital or health board specifically regarding the implementation of the 1995 guidelines on the control of MRSA in health care settings.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of HAIs including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA. Improving the standards of cleanliness in hospitals is a priority. One of the specific actions identified in the ten point plan to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services refers to the need to address this particular issue.</P><Col N="781"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
        <P Just="Left">In order to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including MRSA, the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, was launched by the Department of Health and Children in June 2001 and it sets out national policy in this area. Since then, approximately &euro;20 million in funding has been made available under the strategy. This SARI funding is in addition to normal hospital funding arrangements in regard to infection control.</P>
        <P>A SARI infection control sub-committee has updated the 1995 national guidelines for the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community. The key recommendations cover such areas as environmental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These guidelines are currently with the Health Service Executive for finalisation and are expected to be published in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of HAIs including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA. The SARI infection control sub-committee released national guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings during 2004. These guidelines have been widely circulated by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and are available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The prevention and control of hospital acquired infections is a priority for me and for the Health Service Executive. The director of the National Hospitals Office has engaged external consultants to carry out an independent hygiene audit of hospitals this summer. The results of the audit will be made public and will ensure that the issue of hygiene is taken more seriously by hospitals than it has been heretofore.</P>
        <P>Every hospital in the country will know that the public will have access to the results of the hygiene audit and this will encourage hospitals to perform better to tackle MRSA and help to ensure that the matter is taken more seriously. I am not happy with the standard of hygiene in hospitals and it is one of the first matters with which I asked the new National Hospitals Office to deal. I am determined that our hospitals are run to the highest possible standards. There is no excuse for low standards when huge money is being spent on cleaning programmes involving both in-house cleaning and outside contracts.</P>
        <P>We need an all out national effort in regard to MRSA. Anything that requires to be done will be done, either by way of reporting, getting correct data published and changing practices in hospitals. We will also be making money available for public awareness campaigns targeted at people visiting hospitals so that they are fully informed about best hygiene practices.</P>

        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, established on 1 January 2005, to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for progressing the bulk of the health capital programme in 2005 and in future years. The total capital provision for the health service, as announced earlier this year as part of the overall public capital programme, is just over &euro;584 million.</P>
        <P>Capital funding for the health service is now largely provided through the Health Service Executive in line with the capital investment framework 2005-09. This amounts to &euro;564 million in 2005. I am pleased to inform the House that I have this morning written to the HSE to convey my agreement to allow for the progression of its capital programme in 2005.</P>

However, I have made inquiries with the superannuation department of the HSE &mdash; shared services &mdash; eastern region. I understand that letters have recently issued to both persons concerned, setting out the options available to them. In each case the persons involved have an option to join either the local government superannuation scheme or opt for an entitlement to a gratuity to a non-pensionable person.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 175 together.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, has adequate financial resources at its disposal.</P>
        <P>The recent blood shortage was not related to funding but was due to increasing demands on the blood supply and more stringent controls and testing. Since 2001 the IBTS has introduced a series of measures to minimise the threat posed by vCJD. These measures include the exclusion from donating of people who have spent one year or more in the UK between 1980 and 1996 and anybody who has received a transfusion either in Ireland or abroad from 1 January 1980. This has resulted in a loss of 20% of existing donors.</P>
        <P>In the first five months of 2005, 4,000 fewer donors attended blood clinics throughout Ireland as compared to 2004. During this period the IBTS undertook intensive local advertising, through print media and local radio, text messaging donors, telephoning donors and sending additional notification of clinic locations. Despite this heightened level of activity, maintaining the blood supply proved difficult. Accordingly, on 9 June, the IBTS was forced to request hospitals to defer elective surgery requiring blood transfusions to allow the blood stocks build up to an appropriate level. An intensive advertising campaign was made for blood donations. This is the first time that such an appeal has had to be made since 2002.</P>
        <P>Thankfully, the response to the appeal has been excellent and stocks have now been restored to acceptable levels. The IBTS informed hospitals on 13 June that blood supplies would resume as normal on 14 June. Stock levels for the week beginning 20 June remain at an acceptable level and the IBTS will continue its intensive advertising campaign in the coming months to ensure that this position continues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, provides a template for the development of primary care over a period of ten to 15 years. Considerable work has been undertaken by my Department and the former health boards to advance implementation.</P>
        <P>There are three broad approaches required to enable the primary care strategy to be <Col N="785"/>implemented. These are revenue and capital investment by the State in order to deliver additional services in primary care; the substantial reorganisation of the resources already within the health services; and a structured role for the private sector in the development of facilities and possibly also the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>An initial ten primary care teams have been developed, with funding to enable existing staff resources within the public system to be augmented with additional health professionals. These teams are intended to demonstrate the primary care model in action and also to enable practical experience to be gained of the process involved in developing a primary care team and providing an expanded range of services.</P>
        <P>Work has already been undertaken by the former health boards to map out the proposed numbers, locations and configurations of future primary care teams and networks and the resource requirements associated with these. The Health Service Executive must complete this task to provide a firm basis for the future organisation of resources within primary care, and incorporating the significant numbers of staff and contractors already involved in the delivery of primary care services.</P>
        <P>Work is almost complete on a strategy and action plan on information and communications technology, ICT, for primary care. This will provide a basis for the development of ICT systems which support interdisciplinary primary care and which also facilitate the delivery of care in an integrated way across all sectors within the health service.</P>
        <P>All of the investment needed to enable the implementation of the strategy need not involve the public sector. Many primary care services are already delivered by private and non-State contractors. I am committed to developing policy which will stimulate private sector investment in developing facilities and services. My Department is considering how this agenda can be advanced so as to harness the undoubted potential within the non-State sector and so enable and support the delivery of integrated primary care services in line with national policy.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that no instructions have been issued by my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, or by the Department in regard to restricting the release of information to public representatives on public and private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The Government is aware of the strong public interest in increasing the openness and transparency of the process of investigation of complaints by public bodies, particularly where the complaints concern the provision of care for older or vulnerable people. The Health Service Executive has now made a policy decision that with immediate effect the reports of all completed inspections of nursing homes should be made available to members of the public on request subject to legislation on freedom of information and data protection.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, access to certain records may be denied on the basis that disclosure of the information sought could involve the release of personal information on staff members or residents of the home. The Executive has decided that following a review and the standardisation of inspection report formats and consultation with key stakeholders, that it will publish all future reports on the its website subject of course to compliance with legislation in relation to the release of information.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 101, 144 and 171 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care, including radiotherapy, to cancer patients. The Government is therefore determined to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards.</P>
        <P>The immediate developments in Cork and Galway have resulted in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. Two additional linear accelerators are being provided at the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital, CUH. The first of these linear accelerators was fully commissioned in March and the second is expected to be commissioned by the autumn. Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at CUH with sessional commitments to the south-eastern and the mid-western areas.</P>
        <P>Patients in the north-west are currently being referred for radiation oncology treatment to the recently commissioned radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, and also to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin. A consultant radiation oncologist with significant sessional commitments to the north-western area has recently been appointed to UCHG.</P>
        <P>I will be meeting the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, shortly and I have asked that North-South co-operation on cancer services be put on the agenda. In addition, further discussions are scheduled to take place later this month between the HSE north-western area and Belfast City Hospital in regard to access to radiation oncology services for patients in the north-west &mdash; mainly <Col N="788"/>Donegal. My Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive to advise the Deputies of progress on these discussions.

	<P>I, and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, signed the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 on 14 June last, and these regulations reinstate charges for inpatient services and put them on a sound legal basis for the first time in 29 years. The regulations were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 June.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 defines inpatient services as meaning &ldquo;institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied.</P>
        <P>Class 1, the first class, refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser. Class 2, the second class, refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the HSE may reduce or waive a charge imposed if it is of the opinion that, having regard to the financial circumstances of that person, it is necessary to do so in order to avoid undue financial hardship in relation to that person. This section also allows for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for <Col N="789"/>periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. It also ensures that the weekly rate shall not exceed 80% of the maximum of the weekly rate of the old age non-contributory pension payable at the time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 310 and 311 together.</P><Col N="790"/>
        <P>The latest available employment data for the health services is in respect of year end 2004. The information requested by the Deputy on health service staff, including employment growth in each of the grade categories from end 1997 up to that date, is set out in the table below. However, some caution should be exercised in comparing employment growth between grade categories owing to some changes in their composition over the period.</P>
        <P>Between 1997 and year end 2004, there was an increase in the level of employment of 30,882, or 45.5%, excluding home helps, in wholetime equivalent terms. In this context, comparing employment levels at end-December 2004 to those at end-1997, there were 40.9% &mdash; plus 2,037 &mdash; more medical-dental personnel, 116% &mdash; plus 6,892 &mdash; more health and social care professionals and 25.5% &mdash; plus 6,967 &mdash; more nurses employed in the health services in wholetime equivalent, WTE, terms.</P>
        <P>The health service employment return does not gather information on the number of staff employed in the health services on a contract basis. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The significantly increased staffing levels over the last eight years reflect the substantial service developments which have occurred, particularly in the areas of child protection and intellectual disability services. There have also been significant increases in staffing levels in acute hospitals arising from the national cancer strategy and the cardiovascular strategy. Resources must be targeted where most required and I have consistently stressed that, in the management of health service employment levels, front-line service delivery must be safeguarded.</P><Col N="789"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 100, 153 and 162 together.</P>
        <P>The National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You was launched in 2001 by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. The strategy is centred on a whole system approach to tackling health in Ireland and it goes beyond the traditional concept of health services. It is about developing a system in which best health and social well-being are valued and supported. The strategy sets out a blueprint to guide policy makers and service providers in the planning and delivery of health services over a seven to ten year period. It set national goals for better health for everyone, fair access, responsive and appropriate care delivery and high performance.</P>
        <P>There have been many reforms to our health services since the publication of the strategy, the most notable being the enactment of the Health Act 2004 which transferred responsibility for the <Col N="792"/>management and delivery of health and personal social services to the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The strategy outlined a number of action points in regard to services for older people and the executive is continuing to implement these. The Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have details of the specific services for older people being delivered now to be collated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I would like to highlight to the Deputy a number of developments since the publication of the strategy as follows: from 2002 to 2004, approximately &euro;121 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services for older people; in 2005, a total of &euro;15.228 million in additional funding was allocated to services for older people for a variety of services, including nursing home subvention, home care grants, elder abuse and the home help service; and a working group comprising all stakeholders was established by the Department to review the operation and administration of the nursing home subvention scheme following on from the publication of the O&rsquo;Shea report on the scheme. This review was launched simultaneously with the Department of Social and Family Affairs&rsquo; report on the financing of long-term care in 2003. An interdepartmental group, comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was then established in January to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. This group is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and Minster for Social and Family Affairs this summer. Home care grant schemes have been piloted in a number of areas as an alternative to long-term residential care to assist older people living at home in the community. Older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital system and those living in the community are being targeted under these schemes. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated in 2005 to the Health Service Executive for the scheme.</P>
        <P>The ten point plan aimed at improving the delivery of accident and emergency services announced by the T&aacute;naiste is being implemented now. Additional revenue funding of &euro;70 million has been made available to the Health Service Executive, HSE, in 2005 for these initiatives, which include measures to facilitate the discharge of patients from acute hospital beds to a more <Col N="793"/>appropriate setting. Under this plan there are three specific proposals relating to services for older people: an additional 500 older people are to receive intermediate care for up to six weeks in the private sector, 100 high dependency patients are to be transferred from acute hospitals to private nursing home care; and the home care package scheme is to be expanded to support 500 additional older people who have been discharged from the acute hospital sector to their own home.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 160, 169 and 253 together.</P>
        <P>The national breast screening programme commenced in 2000 and covers the eastern, midland, north-eastern and parts of the south-eastern regions of the country. There are approximately 160,000 women in the target age group in these regions.</P>
        <P>New facilities for the expansion of BreastCheck to the remaining regions are included in the health capital investment framework 2005-09. My Department recently gave approval to BreastCheck to advertise for the appointment of a design team to work up detailed plans for the design and construction of two clinical units, one at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. The selection process for the design team is well advanced. <Col N="794"/>BreastCheck anticipates that the shortlisting, interviews and fee negotiations will be complete by the end of July 2005. Discussions on manpower requirements are currently taking place involving BreastCheck, the Health Service Executive and my Department. I am confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of the national roll-out will be met.</P>
        <P>There are approximately 130,000 women in the target age group in the remaining regions. The national expansion will ensure that all women in the relevant age group in every county throughout the country will have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Following the national roll-out and when the programme is sufficiently developed and quality assured, consideration will be given to extending the upper age limit. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there is no legal obligation on the Health Service Executive to check the inspection reports of a private nursing home prior to placing a patient in that facility. However, the HSE when considering placing a person in such a facility, would have regard to the standards of care provided there. In this regard the results of inspection reports would be taken into account when assessing the suitability of such establishments.</P>
        <P>The Department is currently reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and regulations made under the Act to strengthen the powers available to the HSE. This will be a wide-ranging review which will have the rights of patients at its centre and the issues raised by the Deputy will be taken into account as part of the review.

        <P>The Deputies&rsquo; questions relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the HSE that its western area emergency ambulance service provides a service to a population of over 350,000 people from ten stations spread throughout the catchment area. There has been significant expansion of the service in recent years. For example, ten additional crews have been put in place; the number of 24-hour bases has increased from <Col N="796"/>three to five, while the overall hours of operation across all bases have increased significantly.</P>
        <P>In 2004 the HSE, western area, purchased six new high specification ambulances. In addition, two new rapid response vehicles were introduced as back up to the new fleet. Facilities have also been improved at ambulance stations in Ballina, Boyle, Clifden and Roscommon.</P>
        <P>The HSE, western area, has proposals for the establishment of additional stations in Tuam, west Roscommon and in the Achill-Mulranny area. The question of progressing these proposals is a matter to be addressed by the Health Service Executive in the context of the capital investment framework 2005-09.</P>

	<P>Under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, the Medical Council is charged with responsibility for the registration of medical practitioners and the regulation of their activities. The function of the Medical Council is to protect the public through implementing appropriate standards and controls on the medical profession. All doctors practising medicine in Ireland must be registered with the Medical Council.</P>
        <P>The establishment and operation of acute hospitals, public or private, has never been subject to statutory registration or licensing in this country. My Department is considering the need for the introduction of such provisions.</P>
        <P>Persons who avail of the services of doctors performing plastic surgery should endeavour to seek the services of reputable providers. When invasive procedures are being arranged, persons would be strongly advised to check that the services are provided by a medical practitioner who is appropriately registered with the Medical Council. In addition, before agreeing to undergo any procedure, persons should ascertain the level of follow-up medical support which will be available to them after the surgery has been completed.</P>
        <P>The Medical Council produces a guide to ethical conduct and behaviour in accordance with section 69(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act. This publication includes guidance for doctors on the required standard for practice premises and standards in regard to centres of health care. The council is in a position to consider alleged breaches of the guide in respect of doctors who are registered with it. Where a concern arises about the professional activity of a registered medical practitioner, the Medical Council has the power to investigate the circumstances of the complaint, and, if a <i>prima facie</i> case exists, to conduct an inquiry. Where a finding of professional misconduct or unfitness to practise is made against a doctor, the council has the authority to suspend, limit or revoke the registration of that individual.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a new medical practitioners Bill is currently being drafted by parliamentary counsel in order to substantially <Col N="798"/>update the provisions of the 1978 legislation. Among the many changes I propose to introduce are a clear compulsory requirement for registration for all medical practitioners, changes to the fitness to practise process, the introduction of a mandatory scheme of competence assurance for all doctors practising independently and a much increased public profile for the council. I also intend to significantly increase the non-medical representation on the council in order to best ensure that public safety and protection is given the highest possible priority by the council as it develops in the coming years.</P>
        <P>It is my belief that these and other new provisions of the Bill should afford greater protection to the public. I hope to be in a position to publish the Bill before the end of the year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is extremely concerned at the situation in Leas Cross nursing home. It is unacceptable that older people should be subjected to the type of environment portrayed by the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the House that the Health Service Executive appointed: a director of nursing to oversee its operation; a team of support clinicians, including a senior nurse manager, drawn from the HSE; a team of occupational therapists, to assess all patients in regard to seating, mobility and other related areas; a team of dieticians to assess the dietetic needs of all patients; and an independent investigating team to inquire into the allegations highlighted on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme.</P>
        <P>The director of nursing, who now manages the delivery of care in Leas Cross, keeps HSE senior management informed on a daily basis about service delivery issues.</P>
        <P>However, the HSE having reviewed the standards of patient care at the home, has decided to move public patients to alternative nursing home care more appropriate to their needs as it is of the opinion that these patients are not being appropriately cared for at the home. The HSE is also advising the families of other residents of the home that they would be well advised to consider seeking alternative accommodation for their relatives. In addition, the HSE is considering applying to the courts to have the home de-registered as it is of the opinion that the home is in breach of some of the conditions of its registration as a private nursing home and is not in a position to provide appropriate care to its residents.</P>
        <P>The HSE has also initiated a review of the current approach to nursing home inspections. This review will examine issues such as preparation work undertaken, assessment tools used, methodologies employed during inspections, guidelines dealing with announced and unannounced visits, and procedures to assess the quality of care. The reviewer has been asked to provide a report to the HSE outlining his findings, including any actions which should be taken to improve the quality of the inspection process and to identify any other issues that need to be addressed for the future.</P>
        <P>It is the intention of the HSE, that, following this review all completed inspection forms will be published on the HSE website for public information. However, with immediate effect the reports of all completed inspections of nursing homes should be made available to members of <Col N="800"/>the public on request subject to the freedom of information legislation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Generally the reduction in recent years in the number of medical cards may be attributed to the increase in the number of people in employment and also the improved economic situation nationally. Additionally, during 2003 and 2004, health boards undertook a review of medical card databases in which approximately 104,000 medical cards records were removed. Normal reviews of databases lead to deletions of medical card records as a result of duplicate entries, change of address, cases where the medical card holder is deceased or ineligibility results due to changed circumstances. Periodic reviews of medical card databases are undertaken by the Health Service Executive, HSE, to ensure their continued accuracy.</P>
        <P>In 2005 funding was provided to allow the HSE provide an additional 30,000 people with full medical cards and also to extend free access to general practitioner services under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to up to a further 200,000 persons. The reason for this initiative was to ensure that as many people as possible, particularly those on low income and with children, would be free from the worry of costs associated with accessing general practitioner services for themselves and their children.</P>
        <P>The HSE has put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for the introduction of the &ldquo;GP visit&rdquo; cards and have been requested to put in place mechanisms to ensure that targets are met. It is intended that a public information campaign will be undertaken which will indicate the process to be followed by applicants to obtain application forms and to have their eligibility assessed by the HSE. It is envisaged that the general practitioners services available to &ldquo;GP visit&rdquo; card holders will be the same as those available to patients with full eligibility under the GMS scheme. The Labour Relations Commission last night issued a comprehensive recommendation for settling a range of issues between the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, including issues surrounding the introduction of the &ldquo;GP visit&rdquo; card. I welcome the recommendation and I am hopeful that it will be accepted by the IMO so <Col N="802"/>that the &ldquo;GP visit&rdquo; card initiative can be implemented without further delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the establishment of the Health Service Executive, the chief officers, that is, the former health board CEOs, in each of its administrative areas have continued to deal with parliamentary questions in accordance with the arrangements which previously operated under the health boards. This arrangement was calculated to avoid any erosion in the accountability &mdash; as regards the timeliness or quality of replies &mdash; arising under the parliamentary question system since the health boards were abolished.</P>
        <P>The interim CEO of the executive has assured me that, following the transfer of responsibilities from the chief officers to the national directors on 15 June 2005, similar arrangements have been made in each administrative area so that parliamentary questions will continue to be dealt with in an appropriate manner.</P>
        <P>The executive recently established a parliamentary affairs division. A key function of this division involves the making of arrangements to respond to queries raised in parliamentary questions that are appropriate for direct reply by the executive, having regard to its object and functions under the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <P>The parliamentary affairs division monitors, throughout the executive&rsquo;s national directorates and administrative areas, the timeliness of replies and follows up immediately where a reply has not issued within 20 working days of receipt of the referral. The subject matter of questions can differ greatly in terms of their complexity and the extent of the detail sought. This can impact on the length of time required to assemble the information in order to reply to the query raised. The <Col N="803"/>executive informs me that, on average, 75% of all replies are issued within the timeframe referred to.</P>
        <P>As stated in the executive&rsquo;s service plan for 2005, this is a priority area of work for its corporate affairs directorate. I am satisfied that, in the organisational arrangements currently being made to complete the transition to the unitary system, due importance and attention is being given by the executive to enhancing its capacity to respond in an efficient and timely manner to requests for information from Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges for publicly funded long-term residential care. All those who were charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. It is estimated that the scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion. The decision to limit payments to the estates of those who died in the past six years reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the Statute of Limitations. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the consumer price index.</P>
        <P>I intend to bring legislation to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme before the Oireachtas in the autumn. The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs.</P>

        <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that it is the intention of the Department to put in place a more robust regulatory system as quickly as possible to protect vulnerable older people and to provide for the highest possible standards of care for older people in long-stay facilities.</P>
        <P>This process has begun by firstly reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and regulations made under the Act with a view to strengthening the powers available to the regulatory authorities. Second, the social services inspectorate will be established on a statutory basis and it is intended to extend its remit to include residential facilities for older people, both public and private. The inspectorate will be independent of the Health Service Executive and the Department. Legislation to give effect to these changes will be brought before the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
        <P>In addition, the HSE has been working on a common national approach to the inspection of nursing homes. The Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has also commenced work on examining the development of accreditation standards for residential care for older people, both public and private. In this regard it is developing a pilot programme which includes both public long-stay units and private nursing homes.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 159 together.</P>
        <P>Incontinence products are not available through the usual general medical services arrangements in place for the provision of drugs and non-drug items to medical card holders in the community.</P>
        <P>Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 provides that individuals resident in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention from the health board may not be charged extra for any service which is considered to be essential to their maintenance in the home and common practice in most nursing homes. Such services include bed and board, nursing care appropriate to the level <Col N="808"/>of dependency of the person and incontinence wear.</P>
        <P>On 26 February 2001, on the instructions of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, a letter issued to the former health boards-Eastern Regional Health Authority requesting that the necessary arrangements be put in place so that all medical card holders in receipt of subvention be supplied with incontinence wear on the same basis as if they were living in the community. This letter was not a direction pursuant to a statutory authority, there was no legal obligation on any of the health boards to implement the contents of the letter, each board could decide at its discretion how and if it would respond to the request, any board which decided to respond to the request could decide on the date to do so, and that boards could rely on article 16 of the regulations in relation to the supply of incontinence wear by nursing home proprietors if they chose to do so. Arrangements are currently in place in the majority of areas for the supply of incontinence wear to medical card holders in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>From 2003 additional funding was allocated towards the nursing home subvention scheme to assist with the costs of supplying incontinence wear to patients in private nursing homes who are in receipt of a subvention under the nursing home subvention scheme. This funding also assists with costs associated in managing the scheme and providing training and education in relation to incontinence issues.</P>

	<P>Primary community and continuing care will be delivered primarily through local health offices or LHOs based on the existing 32 community care areas. The information sought by the Deputy regarding the location of these offices is set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the HSE that, at present, there is a general manager assigned with responsibility for managing all community-based services from these community care offices. The HSE has advised that the appointment of the 32 LHO managers, and the establishment of a manage<Col N="809"/>ment structure and processes that support the primary community and continuing care service delivery across LHOs, is an immediate priority. The HSE recruitment process to appoint the 32 <Col N="810"/>LHO managers is well advanced and it is intended that all LHO managers will be in their posts by 1 September 2005. </P><Col N="809"/>

	<P>Employment levels for the health service have been adjusted since 2002 in line with <Col N="812"/>Government policy on public sector employment and service developments. The 2005 employment ceiling is 97,550. The latest available employment returns for the health services are in respect of end-2004 and are set out in the following table. The outturn, excluding home helps, at that date was 98,723 whole time equivalents or WTEs.</P>
        <P>I am awaiting detailed proposals from the Health Service Executive regarding compliance with approved employment levels consistent with safeguarding front line service delivery and achieving an appropriate balance between clinical and non-clinical employment levels in the health service.

	<P>Funding for full out of hours co-operatives commenced in 2000. Between 2000 and 2004 a total of &euro;72.882 million was allocated to the Health Service Executive for out of hours co-operatives nationally, and in 2005, &euro;31.98 million has been included in its baseline funding, <Col N="813"/>which includes &euro;5.6 million additional funding. These figures do not include the fees of the participating doctors.</P>
        <P>All areas of the Health Service Executive have expanded their out of hours co-operatives and services since 2003. Co-operatives are now found in part of all areas of the Health Service Executive, providing coverage in part of all of the Twenty-six Counties. Decisions with regard to the geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and any developments or expansions are for each area of the Health Service Executive to make, having regard to the service needs and the strategic, financial and other issues involved.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the report of the research commissioned by the Special Residential Services Board on the impact of placement in special care unit settings on the well-being of young people and their families. The research was conducted between 2001 and 2003 in two special care units, <Col N="815"/>Ballydowd in Dublin and Gleann Alainn in Cork. The operation of these units is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>Special care is a relatively new development in the Irish child care system. Special care units provide a secure environment for a small number of non-offending young people in need of special care or protection. Placement in special care requires a court order of detention. While the core qualitative sample in the study is small, the research is useful. The report indicates that the approach in special care-focused therapy, purposeful care and high quality education facilities and programmes is having a positive impact on children.</P>
        <P>The Special Residential Services Board is also cognisant that the research covers the period 2001-2003 and that the child care services including special care services have developed significantly since then. It is the HSE&rsquo;s intention to centralise the management of special care. This will address issues such as consistency of approach and continuity of care which are identified by the report. The issues which are key to the successful provision of special care include training of staff and staff mix in terms of gender, age and experience; professional understanding on the part of staff on the presenting behaviour of the child and how to address that behaviour; the quality of care plans and the continuity of service provision in terms of through-care and after-care; an atmosphere of respect and involvement that relates to the child and his-her family, and good quality leadership and management of the unit and collaborative working with the broader services and disciplines.</P>

	<P>The national cancer forum is currently finalising a new national cancer strategy. The strategy has been developed in consultation with the major stakeholders, professional and voluntary groups and the general public, and will have regard to the multi-faceted aspects of cancer control. The strategy will set out the key priorities for the development of cancer services over the coming years and will make recommendations regarding a balanced organisation of cancer services nationally, with defined roles for hospitals in the delivery of cancer care. It is anticipated that this work will be completed in the autumn.</P>

I intend to bring legislation before the Oireachtas in the autumn which will provide a clear legal framework for a repayments scheme for those who were unlawfully charged.

The scheme will also allow for repayments to be made to the estates of all those who were charged but who died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004.</P>

	<P>The policy of the Government is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home, in accordance with their wishes. To this end, home care grant schemes have been piloted in a number of areas as an alternative to long-term residential care to assist older people living at home in their communities. Older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital system and those living in the community are being targeted under these schemes. Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the Health Service Executive for the scheme in 2005. This is in keeping with a key recommendation of the review of the nursing home subvention scheme, namely that the health services develop a home-based subvention system for older people as an alternative to long-term care.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established to consider the future financing of long-term care. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O&rsquo;Shea. This group is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social and Family Affairs this summer.</P>
        <P>In addition, the total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas from 2000 to 2004 was approximately 94%. Additional funding of &euro;5 million was allocated in 2005 to the home help service to support older people living in the community, bringing funding for the service in 2005 to over &euro;131 million.</P>
        <P>I also wish to advise the Deputy that &euro;70 million has been made available to the HSE in 2005 for the ten point plan to relieve ongoing pressure on acute hospital beds and accident and emergency services. Under the plan, the home care package scheme is to be expanded to support 500 additional older people who have been discharged from the acute hospital sector to their own homes.</P>
        <P>The issues of waiting lists for the home care grant and home help hours relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to have this matter investigated and to reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <P>I presume both Deputies are referring to the arrangements available to former health board chief executive officers retiring from the Health Service Executive by 1 July 2005. These arrangements are available to chief executive officers on the basis of their unique position within the context of the transition to the new health service structures and their leading role in facilitating the transfer of accountability and a safe passage to the new structures. The arrangements contain three elements. First, payment of their severance terms, including pension, lump sum and severance pay as provided for under section 78 of the local government superannuation scheme, of which they are members. The amount due to each individual varies depending on salary and service. Second, an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment, the net amount to be equivalent to six months&rsquo; salary. The estimated total cost of this element of the package is &euro;650,000. Third, a retraining grant of up to &euro;10,000 to be paid on the basis of vouched expenditure.</P>
        <P>No payments under these arrangements have been made to date. Severance packages have not been agreed for other senior staff of former health boards.</P>

	<P>Since January 2005, I have had ongoing contacts with all political parties in Northern Ireland. I often meet political parties and others involved with the situation in Northern Ireland when they are in Dublin. It is a very helpful part of the process. I have made it absolutely clear that the Government will maintain dialogue with Sinn F&eacute;in and that is what I have continued to do. As I informed the D&aacute;il on 14 June, in addition to the well-publicised meetings on 25 January 2005 and 16 March 2005, I had meetings with Gerry Adams prior to, during and after the elections in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>New facilities for the national expansion of BreastCheck are included in the health capital investment framework 2005 to 2009. My Department recently gave approval to BreastCheck to advertise for the appointment of a design team to work up detailed plans for the design and construction of two clinical units, one at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. The catchment area of these centres will include Limerick and the mid-west region. The selection process for the design team is well advanced. BreastCheck anticipates that the shortlisting, interviews and fee negotiations will be complete by the end of July 2005. Discussions on manpower requirements are currently taking place involving BreastCheck, the Health Service Executive and my Department. I am confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of the national roll-out will be met.</P>
        <P>I understand that discussions are shortly to take place between BreastCheck and Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital medical centre concerning the centre&rsquo;s wish to provide mammography services as part of a population based screening programme. The provision of mammography tests outside of a population based screening programme is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter examined and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The report of the task force on assaults on psychiatric nurses was completed in 2003. In addition to quantifying the level of assaults and making recommendations in relation to prevention, the report contained proposals for a scheme of compensation for psychiatric nurses who have been seriously injured as a result of an assault by a patient in the workplace.</P>
        <P>Government approval would be required for the introduction of any new State compensation scheme, which would be additional to the existing serious physical assaults scheme, last revised in 2001. The serious physical assaults scheme provides enhanced sick pay arrangements for nurses assaulted at work. Medical expenses are also refunded. In circumstances where a nurse is certified permanently unfit to resume duty they may be paid five sixths of full salary until retirement.</P>
        <P>In late 2003 a draft memorandum for Government was circulated and, during the consultation process, complex legal and financial issues emerged in relation to aspects of the scheme proposed by the taskforce and their implications for the health service and the wider public service.</P><Col N="833"/>

        <P>In March 2004 the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU were advised that serious concerns that had been raised in relation to the proposed scheme. Officials from my Department have been in ongoing consultation with the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to addressing the issues raised. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the issues involved are very complex and have far-reaching implications for the health service. I am in the process of consulting with my colleagues in Government on this issue and I expect to be in a position to provide more definite information shortly.</P>

	<P>There are schemes in operation that provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for determination by the Health Service Executive. In determining eligibility, consideration is given to the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances. Income guidelines are used to assist in determining eligibility. Non-medical card holders can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that it is the intention of the Department to put in place a more robust regulatory system as quickly as possible to protect vulnerable older people and to provide for the highest possible standards of care for older people in long-stay facilities.</P>
        <P>This process has begun by firstly reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 and regulations made under the Act with a view to strengthening the powers available to the regulat<Col N="834"/>ory authorities. Secondly, the social services inspectorate will be established on a statutory basis and it is intended to extend its remit to include residential facilities for older people, both public and private. The inspectorate will be independent of the Health Service Executive and the Department. Legislation to give effect to these changes will be brought before the Oireachtas later this year.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental group, comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was established in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, including long-stay care for older people. The group is due to report to the T&aacute;naiste and Minster for Social and Family Affairs this summer.</P>
        <P>The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993 to assist people with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended to cover the entire cost of such care. At this stage it is not the intention to increase subvention rates.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a forum on fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum report&rsquo;s main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.</P>
        <P>In all the report of the forum on fluoridation made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, policy and technical aspects of fluoridation and the establishment of an expert body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Irish expert body on fluorides and health held its inaugural meeting in April 2004. The terms of reference of the expert body are as follows: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; <Col N="838"/>and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his-her request or on its own initiative.</P>
        <P>The expert body on fluorides and health is currently examining the regulations governing fluoridation of public piped water supplies with the aim of making proposals to me for the purposes of implementing the recommendation of the forum to reduce the level of fluoride in public piped water supplies. As part of this exercise the expert body is currently carrying out a census of public piped water supplies and when this work is complete the expert body will make recommendations to me in relation to the updating of the current regulations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory basis for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies is the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 [No. 46 of 1960] and various regulations made under the Act. The Act provides for the making by health authorities of arrangements for the fluoridation of water supplied by sanitary authorities through pipes. The Act also provides that the amount of fluorine added to a water supply shall not exceed one part by weight of fluorine per million parts of water.</P>
        <P>I am informed that the information sought by the Deputy is not routinely available. However, I also understand that the Irish expert body on fluorides and health is currently examining the regulations governing fluoridation of public piped water supplies and, as part of this exercise, is currently carrying out a census of public piped water supplies which will include the information sought by the Deputy. When this work is complete the expert body will make recommendations in relation to the updating of the current regulations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 to 227, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, the Registrar General, is the person with statutory responsibility for the administration of the civil registration system in Ireland. I have made inquiries of the RegistrarGeneral and the position is as set out below.</P>
        <P>The General Register Office, GRO, with the exception of its public research facility, relocated to Roscommon on 11 April last. The GRO has moved into the new Government offices in Roscommon, which include a purpose-built high-technology archival storage facility. The public research facility remains in Joyce House, Dublin 2.</P>
        <P>Considerable efforts have been ongoing to ensure the hand-over of sufficient skills and corporate knowledge to enable the new team to provide an efficient service from the new location and this has been a factor in progressing the civil registration modernisation programme, including the implementation of the Civil Registration Act 2004. I am glad to inform the Deputy, however, that the decentralisation has worked well and I would like to congratulate all the staff of the GRO, past and present, who worked hard to make the move a success.</P>
        <P>The Civil Registration Service has been engaged in a major modernisation programme in recent years, including conversion of historic records to electronic format; implementation of a new computerised registration system; and organisational reform. This work, which is key to the implementation of the Civil Registration Act 2004, is being carried out in phases and the stage has been reached where it will soon be possible to begin commencing certain provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>In the course of the preparatory work towards commencement, legal advice was received to the effect that an amendment to the 2004 Act is required. The amendment is small and technical in nature and the amending legislation required will be brought before the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date.</P>
        <P>The Civil Registration Act 2004 provides for the commencement of the various provisions of the Act on a gradual basis. It is hoped that Parts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of the Act, which relate to the administration of the service and the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths, will be commenced shortly after the amending bill has been passed.</P>
        <P>The new procedures for marriage are set out in Part 6 of the Act and include universal procedures for notification, solemnisation and registration of marriages, as well as a choice of venue for civil marriages. Before these provisions can be commenced, a substantial body of work needs <Col N="840"/>to be completed, including drafting and publication of regulations, guidelines and detailed procedures; establishment of a register of solemnisers in consultation with religious bodies; establishment of a register of approved venues for civil marriages; and the further development of the computer system to facilitate the administration of the new marriage provisions introduced by the Act.</P>
        <P>The Registrar General is unable to give a specific date for the implementation of the new marriage procedures but it is unlikely to be before the autumn of 2006. This timescale is dependent on the passage of the amending legislation referred to above. It is intended to give as much public notice as possible and a comprehensive public information campaign will be undertaken at the appropriate time.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the other provisions, relating to registration of adoptions, divorces and civil nullity, will follow commencement of the marriage provisions.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the recent study by the National Council on Aging and Older People which states that discrimination and ageism against older persons is rife in the health and social services systems; the action she plans to take in view of this report; if she will implement its recommendations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the publication of the report of the National Council on Aging and Older People, Perceptions of Ageism in Health and Social Services in Ireland. The report highlights the findings of research carried out in the ten former health boards during 2004 involving some 450 older people and 150 health and social services staff.</P>
        <P>I understand that the study sought to investigate whether older Irish people experience ageism within health and social services and, if so, to ascertain the impact of this experience. Ageism refers to deeply rooted negative beliefs about older people and the ageing process, which may lead to age discrimination.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to promoting health ageing and to an age-friendly society. The Department is also committed to ensuring that older people, who have contributed to the development of our society, are treated with dignity and respect when receiving health care services.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the provision of health care services throughout the country and must ensure that all the services it provides are age-friendly. The Department will be liaising with the HSE in relation to the recommendations in the report.</P>

	<P>My Department does not directly fund or co-ordinate health and personal social services to victims of abuse. Moneys are made available each year, formerly through the health boards, and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in funding so that now over &euro;12 million is provided annually for the provision of such services. The distribution of this funding is now a matter for the Health Service Executive. I have asked the HSE, together with my Department, to carry out an analysis of the current level of service provision in this area and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>Monosodium glutamate, MSG, food additive No. E621, is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid, which occurs naturally in the body. As a substance added to food, its main function is as a flavour-enhancing agent, it is not used as a preservative. It is sold as a fine white crystal substance, similar in appearance to salt or sugar, which does not have a distinct taste of its own. Food additive uses of MSG include its incorporation into food and its use as a condiment. MSG has been authorised for use in all member states of the European Union including Ireland, under Directive No. 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners, following a rigorous safety assessment by the EU Scientific Committee on Food, SCF. It has also been evaluated by other national and international food safety organisations, including the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFA, of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the US Food and Drug Administration. These organisations have all placed MSG in the safest category of food ingredients and have allocated it no specific acceptable daily intake, ADI. A food additive is only allocated an ADI &ldquo;not specified&rdquo; when, on the basis of the available scientific data, the total intake of the substance following consumption of a typical diet will not represent a hazard to health. If an additive is deemed acceptable for food use, an acceptable daily intake, ADI, is normally set. The concept of the ADI was established by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, JECFA, and is defined as, &ldquo;an estimate of the amount of food additive, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk&rdquo;. Directive 95/2/EC is implemented in Ireland by the European Union (Food Additives other than Colours and Sweeteners) Regulations, S.I. No. 613 of 2002.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has carried out a survey of dietary food additive intake in the European Union, the results of which were reported in October 2001. Ireland took part in this survey, the Irish estimates of food additive intake being provided by the Irish universities nutrition alliance, at the request of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. However, MSG was <Col N="844"/>not among the additives surveyed, since in a priority-setting exercise the Commission decided to exclude additives with ADIs &ldquo;not specified&rdquo; allocated by the SCF from the monitoring exercise on the basis that these did not represent a hazard to health. Reflecting the conclusion that MSG is placed in the safest category of food ingredients, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland does not plan any further survey of MSG in the near future.</P>
        <P>The scientific data on MSG do not support the conclusion that many people are seriously allergic to this ingredient in food. Were this the case, MSG would not have been approved as a food additive in the European Union or have been allocated an ADI &ldquo;not specified&rdquo;. It is however recognised that some individuals are sensitive to the presence of MSG, and may have mild and transitory reactions when they eat foods that contain large amounts of MSG, such as would be found in heavily flavour-enhanced foods. Because MSG is commonly used in Chinese cuisine, these reactions were initially referred to as &ldquo;Chinese restaurant syndrome&rdquo;. This reaction can occur about 20 minutes after a food containing MSG is eaten. However, the cause of this syndrome remains in doubt. Foodstuffs such as pizza and lasagne or spaghetti contain more glutamate and sodium than Chinese meals made with added MSG, leading to the conclusion that glutamate cannot be the primary cause of reactions to Chinese foods.</P>
        <P>The scientific data on MSG also do not support any restrictions on its use. Under the harmonised EU legislation on food additives other than colours and sweeteners, Ireland would have to provide specific justification for a restriction of use for foods placed on the Irish market, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland does not consider that there are scientific grounds for such a restriction.</P>

	<P>Part 10 of the Health Act 2004 provides for the dissolution of certain health bodies and the transfer of their functions and employees to the Health Service Executive with effect from the executive&rsquo;s establishment day. The bodies specified under that part of the Act include the Health Boards Executive, HeBE. Under Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 885 of 2004) made by me pursuant to the Act, the first day of January <Col N="845"/>2005 was appointed as the establishment day of the Health Service Executive. Accordingly, HeBE was dissolved and its functions transferred to the Health Service Executive on the establishment day.</P>

        <P>Broadly, HeBE&rsquo;s annual expenditure was allocated between project expenditure and administration. The bulk of expenditure was incurred on projects. According to its published annual report for 2004, HeBE&rsquo;s total expenditure in 2004 amounted to approximately &euro;15.6 million with the corresponding figure in 2003 being &euro;6.1 million.

	<P>I met representatives of the Neurological Alliance in May. In the course of the meeting, the representatives indicated that pending the implementation of the recommendations of the Comhairle report on neurology and neurophysiology, the appointment of clinical nurse specialists would significantly improve the services available to patients with neurological disorders. Additional revenue funding was identified in the 2005 letters of determination for the development of prioritised services, including neurology, in a number of the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s regional areas.</P>
        <P>Following my meeting with the Neurological Alliance, my Department wrote to the Director of the National Hospitals Office outlining the views of the alliance on the application of funding towards the enhancement of the clinical nurse specialist service in the discipline. The detailed application of the funding is a matter for the Health Service Executive. My Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned Dr. Ronnie Pollock to review existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards. The report concluded that the services available for persons with cystic fibrosis here are not of the standard that they should be. The report provides an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients and makes recommendations regarding the numbers and categories of staff that are appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the report, the Health Service Executive, at the request of the Cystic Fibrosis Association, established a working group to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland, both in hospitals and in the community. The working group will make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services. The working group is multidisciplinary in its composition and includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association. It held its first meeting in early April and I understand that it hopes to complete its work over the next few months. The Pollock report is one of a number of reports relating to cystic fibrosis services being considered by the group. The work of the group will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s specific questions regarding the hospital services available to cystic fibrosis patients in County Mayo relate to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>In July 2003 the Government was approached unilaterally by a firm of New York lawyers with the proposal that the Government could sue certain pharmaceutical companies in the United States arising from the manufacture of blood products that caused Hepatitis C and HIV infection to persons with haemophilia. Initial advice received from counsel appointed by the Attorney General raised serious concerns regarding the proposal. Following careful consideration of this advice, the Attorney General recommended that an independent opinion be obtained in the United States in respect of the proposed litigation. Arrangements to procure such advice are ongoing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Service Executive has been piloting home care grant schemes in a number of areas. These schemes have been targeted at supporting older people living in the community as an alternative to long-term residential care and older people who are being discharged from the acute hospital system. In the HSE eastern regional area, people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the Sl&aacute;n Abhaile and Home First pilot projects. In the HSE southern area, a similar project, Curam, has been piloted, while the Choice programme in the HSE north west area has been in operation for some time. A number of these pilots have been evaluated and the consensus is that they <Col N="852"/>have been successful in supporting older people at home.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to develop the scheme further. In addition, funding of &euro;113.75 million was allocated in 2004 for the home help service to support older people living in the community, with this funding being increased to &euro;118.75 million in 2005. In addition, as part of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ten point plan to relieve ongoing pressure on acute hospital beds and accident and emergency services, it is proposed that the home care package scheme be expanded to support 500 additional older people who have been discharged from the acute hospital sector to their own home.</P>
        <P>Regarding the individual case raised by the Deputy, the question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on figures supplied by the World Health Organisation, Ireland had, in 2003, 2.58 physicians per 1,000 of population. The EU average for 2003 was 3.45. However, the World Health Organisation has stated that international comparisons between countries should be made with caution. Health data recording and handling systems and practices vary between countries as do the availability and accuracy of data reported to the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that Government policy has been to substantially increase the number of hospital consultants. In this context, it should be noted that the number of approved consultant posts has risen from 1,440 at 1 January 2000 to 1,947 at 1 January 2005, an increase of 507, 35%. This trend will be further increased throughout the next decade in line with the recommendations of the report of the national task force on medical staffing. This report recommended that the number of consultant posts be increased by approximately 1,800 by 2013 in order to improve patient care and ensure better patient access to 24-hour services.</P>
        <P>Given the large numbers of staff employed and the unique nature of the services being delivered, a coherent, strategic approach to workforce and human resource planning needs to be developed further. This should be aligned closely with strategic objectives and the service planning process. The Health Service Executive, having responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services under the Health Act 2004, will be centrally involved in the development of an integrated workforce planning strategy for the health sector.</P>

	<P>Pursuant to the provisions of the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive was established to manage the Irish health service nationally with effect from 1 January 2005. The board is the governing body of the executive with authority to perform the functions of the executive. The executive&rsquo;s corporate headquarters is located at Oak House, Millennium Park, Naas, County Kildare.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>The overall organisational structure of the executive is based around ten directorates. Two of these directorates, namely the national hospitals office directorate and the primary community and continuing care directorate, have responsibility for delivering the general hospital services, community care and special hospital services referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>The national hospitals office directorate is responsible for the provision of all acute hospital and ambulance pre-hospital emergency care services throughout the country. It is also responsible for approving the provision of specialised treatment to patients in countries outside the State. Hospital services will be delivered through ten hospital networks, with each having a network manager with responsibility for resource allocation, performance<?oasys _jy?>management and risk assessment and management.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>The primary community and continuing care directorate is responsible for the planning, management and delivery of all primary, community and continuing care services, to maximise the health and well-being of the population. The directorate is responsible for primary care in addition to community-based health and personal social services and continuing care hospitals and services. At a local level, primary community and continuing care will be delivered primarily through local health offices located within the existing 32 community care areas, with a local manager in each office.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 308 together.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for health policy and will continue to be accountable to the Oireachtas in that regard. The Health Service Executive, as the national body with statutory responsibility under the Health Act 2004 for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, will be involved in informing the making of policy by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004, which provided for the establishment of the Health Service Executive on a statutory basis, contains a number of provisions to ensure that the executive is accountable to the Oireachtas. Under the Act, the Minister for Health and Children is required to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the executive&rsquo;s corporate plan and service plan once he or she has approved it. The executive&rsquo;s audited financial statements, together with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and its annual report, must also be laid before the Houses.</P>
        <P>Under the Act, the chief executive officer is appointed the accounting officer for the executive. This provision required the establishment of a separate Vote for the executive for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998. This means that the CEO is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts through the Comptroller and Auditor General for the appropriation accounts of the executive. The executive is also obliged to prepare a set of income and expenditure accounts for which it is accountable to the D&aacute;il through the Committee of Public Accounts. As accounting officer, the CEO will be required to attend before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
        <P>The Act also requires that the CEO attend before an Oireachtas committee to give an account of the general administration of the executive if requested to do so. Provision is also made in the legislation for the attendance of the chairperson or other employees to attend before the Oireachtas committees if requested to do so by the chairperson of the committee.</P>
        <P>There is also a provision in the Act for the making of regulations regarding the executive&rsquo;s dealings with Oireachtas members, including addressing the issue of supplying specific documents or information to Members of the Oireachtas and dealing with correspondence from Oireachtas Members. My Department is currently preparing the regulations required to give effect to that provision and I hope to have them in place shortly.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that figures are not available to estimate with any accuracy the cost of introducing a tax credit for expenditure on child care. However, in my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier parliamentary question on <Col N="863"/>tax relief for child care expenses, answered on 10 February 2005, it is tentatively estimated that if a tax credit of &euro;1,200 per annum per child, or the equivalent of an annual allowance of &euro;6,000 at the standard rate of tax, was introduced for all children under six years of age, the cost to the Exchequer would be in the region of &euro;223 million in a full year. The number of taxpayers likely to benefit from such a measure is estimated at 141,000.</P>
        <P>The additional cost if such a relief were made refundable would depend on the amount of expenditure involved, the liability of individual taxpayers and the impact on economic behaviour of making the relief a refundable tax credit. It is not possible at this point to estimate the cost of such a measure with any degree of certainty.</P>

	<P>I am advised by my officials in the Office of Public Works that fencing issues were discussed at a meeting with Kilkenny County Council officials in January 2005. The council advised that the pre-existing concrete fence along the boundary of the fill area and Riverside Drive was adequate. There are therefore no plans to change the nature of this fencing.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that by &ldquo;the amenity area at Lacken Weir&rdquo; and agreement &ldquo;to restore this green area to the way it was before the scheme started&rdquo;, the Deputy is referring to an area in the county council grounds, adjacent to Maudlin Street. The contractor is to make good the area in question, namely, have it levelled, top soiled and seeded.</P>
        <P>With reference to Maudlin Street Park, the contractor will complete minor works remaining such as installation of kerbs to the footpath, removal of ruts etc. in the coming weeks. My officials advise that the landscaping works <Col N="864"/>remaining in Dukesmeadows include the reinstatement and seeding of a strip of ground next to the roadside hoarding. Once this work is completed and the grass is established sufficiently, the hoarding will be removed, probably in early August.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2% stamp duty, levied on non-life insurance premia, is part of the stamp duty system and applies to most categories of non-life insurance business, including motor insurance. It was introduced in the Finance Act 1982 at 1% and was subsequently increased to 2% in 1993. This is a modest levy compared with that in other EU member states, most of which have such a tax which is generally levied at a significantly higher rate than in Ireland, typically between 9% and 15%.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this non-life levy is to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. It is a significant source of revenue to the Exchequer and yielded &euro;97.7 million in 2004 across all relevant categories of insurance. It is not possible to ascertain what portion of this relates to motor insurance premia. I have no plans to reduce or remove it.</P>

	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. The sale <Col N="867"/>of worms is liable to the standard VAT rate of 21%.</P>
        <P>Member states can apply the reduced VAT rate only to those goods and services which are listed under annex H of the EU sixth VAT directive. As the sale or supply of worms is not an item listed under Annex H, it would not be possible to apply the reduced VAT rate to such products. In addition, it would not be possible to apply a zero rate to such goods, as EU law precludes the addition of any goods or services to those already liable at the zero VAT rate.</P>

	<P>The term-time scheme for civil servants allows staff to take either ten or 13 weeks unpaid leave from June until the end of August. The purpose of the scheme is to allow parents with children up to 18 years of age, or those acting <i>in loco parentis</i>, to match their working arrangements with the main summer holidays of their children. Staff who are primary carers are also eligible to take term-time leave to care for a person who resides with them and who has a disability which gives rise to the need for care on a continuing or frequent basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 343 together.</P>
        <P>In April 2004, the European Commission convened a meeting with Ireland and the United Kingdom to examine the management of the wild Atlantic salmon in Community waters and, in particular, to look at the situation with regard to their interceptory fisheries of mixed stocks of salmon inside the 12-mile limits.</P>
        <P>The Department prepared a detailed submission on the Irish salmon management regime and presented it to the Commission at that meeting. I understand that the Commission fully acknowledged the management measures which the Irish Government has put in place in recent years for the protection and conservation of our wild salmon stocks. I also understand that the Commission confirmed, following this meeting, that member states have the right to regulate salmon fisheries within their own fishery zones up to 12 miles in the absence of any Community regulation.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, given the concerns that the Commission expressed about the nature of such mixed-stock fisheries, the Government agreed to work with the Commission and the United Kingdom authorities to achieve a proper Community regulation of the fisheries. To that end, the Commission was given permission by the Government to approach any experts within the relevant Irish State agencies with a view to helping it produce that report.</P>
        <P>I am advised that in his opening remarks to this year&rsquo;s annual meeting of the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, or NASCO, held recently in Vichy, France, the EU representative confirmed that the European Commission has now begun work on a report on interceptory fisheries on mixed stocks of wild Atlantic salmon in Community waters, which he stated is expected to be completed later this year. I understand that the representative further clarified that any <Col N="869"/>measures proposed for those fisheries as a result of the report would require a thorough debate within the European Union.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that, at the same NASCO meeting, a representative from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, in his general presentation on wild Atlantic salmon stocks, confirmed that, while tagging studies have demonstrated that salmon from all parts of England and Wales are exploited in the Irish coastal fishery, the levels of exploitation have, however, varied between stocks from different regions and from year to year.</P>
        <P>According to the ICES report, it therefore appears that exploitation of salmon from north-east England in the Irish fishery is negligible, that exploitation on stocks from north-west England and north Wales is currently low, but that levels increase as one moves further south in Wales and for rivers in south-west and southern England. Significantly, the representative also confirmed that such exploitation has declined in all areas by almost 60% following the introduction of new management measures in the Irish fishery since 1997.</P>
        <P>Thus, for example, before the introduction of those management measures, exploitation rates in the Irish fishery were estimated at about 28% for the River Test in southern England. According to the ICES representative, however, since the introduction of the regulatory changes, exploitation rates have fallen to 12% for that river and could reasonably be expected to fall further as those management measures are maintained in future years.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that all of this information has been made available to ICES through the preliminary findings from a joint Irish-UK scientific working group of scientists from our Marine Institute and the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries, and Aquaculture Science, with contributions from the Environment Agency, which has been assessing the recent patterns and levels of exploitation on certain UK salmon stocks in the Irish coastal fishery. That report has yet to be finalised, and I expect it in its completed form later this year.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>As that study, with the report being compiled by the European Commission, is expected to provide the first accurate analysis of the impact of interceptory fisheries on mixed stocks of wild salmon in Community waters, I believe we should await the outcome before any further conclusions are drawn in the matter. In the meantime, the Government has no proposals to review its policy on drift-net salmon fishing in Irish waters.</P><?oasys _ic0-?>

	<P>Under the Fisheries Acts, primary responsibility for the protection and conservation of inland fisheries is a matter for the regional fisheries boards, in this case, the Western Regional Fisheries Board. I am aware through that board that an aggressive alien plant species known as lagarosiphon major or curly water weed has been identified in Lough Corrib.</P>
        <P>I understand, that this weed, originally from Africa, poses a serious threat to fish and other wildlife in the area. It is thought the weed was introduced to Ireland through garden centres as a product for ornamental garden ponds.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Central Fisheries Board and the Western Regional Fisheries Board, together with Galway County Council and the national parks and wildlife service, have recently established a lagarosiphon task force. The main aim of that task force is to determine and implement all the possible options for the control and the possible elimination of this invasive alien species.</P>
        <P>I understand that the task force held its first meeting in Oughterard, County Galway, on 26 May this year and has already produced an information leaflet detailing what anglers, boat owners and the public should do to combat the spread of the weed. The task force has also issued a press release to relevant national, regional and angling press to inform the general public of the threat associated with this invasive alien species.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the agencies concerned are continuing to work together to address the problem.</P>

ComReg also issues radio operators&rsquo; certificates <Col N="871"/>of competency to persons who have undertaken an approved course and passed an examination.</P>
        <P>The maritime radio affairs unit of the marine surveyor&rsquo;s office of the Department provides technical advice and support to ComReg for both the radio licences and the radio operators&rsquo; certificates of competency.

	<P>The Marine Institute is investigating a potential case of bonamia ostrea in a wild oyster bed in Lough Foyle. The Marine Institute carried out tests for bonamia in Lough Foyle as part of its routine monitoring programme. Having identified a suspect positive result, the institute then sent further samples to the Community reference laboratory, CRL, in France for confirmatory testing, as required by EU fish health regulations. To date the CRL has confirmed the presence of a suspect organism. Final results from the CRL are expected in the week beginning 20 June.</P>
        <P>In line with the requirements of EU regulations, under Irish legislation, measures are in place which provide for the control of movements of oysters, and other shellfish, from bays around the coast. As a precautionary measure, pending the results of the CRL tests, and as required by the EU regulations regarding disease control, it is on that basis that applications to move oysters and other shellfish originating in Lough Foyle for ongrowing in areas free of bonamia will not be approved by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources at present.</P>
        <P>Within the scope of those preventative measures, movements of boats in and out of Lough Foyle are continuing at present. I am receiving ongoing advice from the Marine Institute regarding the management of the situation.</P>

	<P>In accordance with the Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations, SI 587 of 2001, all crew members of fishing vessels must undertake basic safety training consisting of personal survival techniques, elementary first aid and fire prevention, health and safety training. However, the dates for the completion of a basic safety training course depend on whether the person is a new entrant or a serving crew member. For serving crew members, the application date depends on his or her date of birth and could be as late as March 2008.</P>
        <P>The regulations do not apply to crew members who can provide evidence of having completed approved training in personal survival techniques, first aid and fire-fighting required for fishing vessel officer certificates of competency issued under the Fishing Vessels (Certification of Deck Officer and Engineer Officers) Regulations 1988, SI 289 of 1988. The code of practice for fishing vessels under 15 metres is simply reminding fishermen of those relevant legal requirements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The plan of development approval given for the Corrib gas field in April 2002 by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources was for a sub-sea development with an onshore terminal. Moreover, the developers have planning permission for an onshore terminal. Offshore processing for the Corrib gas field was not the preferred development option, as it would mean that production would be weather-sensitive, a serious drawback in the hostile environment at Corrib, and there would be greater capital and operational expenditure compared with a sub-sea development. The Deputy will accept the increased capital and operational expenditure that would be needed for an offshore terminal could have made the development uneconomic and there would also be increased safety concerns, as the offshore facilities would have to be manned.</P>
        <P>In January 2001, the developers submitted to my Department a plan of development for the Corrib gas field. That states that, regarding facilities engineering, the area in which Corrib is located is characterised by a harsh marine environment, being directly exposed to the Atlantic fetch, a lack of existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure and the presence of active fishery industry interests.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the plan of development sets out the proposed concept &mdash; onshore terminal &mdash; and the alternative offshore concepts that were considered.</P>
        <P>The offshore alternative concepts were eliminated in the plan of development due to a number of considerations, including the following. The water depth and hostile nature of the environment at Corrib do not favour the use of a fixed steel jacket or guyed tower; the latter has not been used outside the benign environment of the Gulf of Mexico. The floating production concepts are similarly not ideally suited to extended field life in the prevailing harsh environment, with large-bore, high-pressure gas export risers being a particular design issue. Remote control buoy technology has not been developed for the extreme environmental conditions experienced at Corrib. Development of an acceptable, reliable system could not be guaranteed within the pro<Col N="876"/>posed project time scale. All the proposed manned facilities options incur high operational expenditure and have increased adverse safety implications, particularly with respect to offshore transfer of personnel. High capital cost of all the floating or fixed platform options combined with the requirement for extensive gas transport infrastructure rendered the options sub-economic with predicted Corrib reserves and envisaged gas sale price. The relatively dry nature of the Corrib gas, eliminating the need for offshore processing, and high reservoir productivity, reducing the number of wells, allow the use of much simplified production facilities with high reliability. That permits the practical adoption of sub-sea production technology for Corrib.</P>
        <P>In December 2000, my Department requested from the developers the results of its alternative concept studies. Those were examined and reviewed in January 2001 by the consultant petroleum engineer advising my Department. He advised the Department that the developers of the Corrib gas field should not be required to change or consider changing the Corrib development scheme.</P>
        <P>Prior to the making of any decision on the consent to install and commission the onshore pipeline, a number of steps have been taken to allay the fears of residents, and especially those who live near the pipeline. First, I have commissioned an independent review of the design standard for the onshore pipeline. That report was widely distributed. Second, I have published the quantified risk assessment, QRA, version F, for the onshore pipeline. Third, I have commissioned an independent review of the QRA.

	<P>Although the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter for the fully liberalised private sector, the delivery of broadband is dependent on access by the sector to suitable infrastructure. Unfortunately, investment by the sector in broadband infrastructure has failed to keep pace with the demand for broadband services.</P>
        <P>Since March 2002, the Government has been addressing the infrastructure deficit with the investment of upwards of &euro;200 million of European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, and State funding under the National Development <Col N="877"/>Plan 2000-2006 in a series of initiatives that will make possible the delivery of broadband in all parts of the country. The keystone of the regional broadband programme is the metropolitan area networks, MANs, initiative, under which 120 towns and cities are being provided with high-capacity optic fibre trunk networks.</P>
        <P>Broadband can be delivered by a number of different technologies, including digital subscriber lines, DSL, fibre, cable, fixed wireless and satellite. While DSL is currently the most popular broadband technology, with 84% of the market, each of these technologies has a part to play in the rollout of services. The MANs are capable of delivering bandwidths that are many hundreds of times greater than the old telephone networks, and will be capable of handling all foreseeable broadband demands for many years into the future.</P>
        <P>The MANs are being managed for the State on an open-access basis, and allow the sector to offer the full range of broadband services at realistic prices. Full details of the MANs programme and my Department&rsquo;s other broadband initiatives, including the county and group broadband scheme and the broadband for schools project, can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>. There are now more than 160,000 broadband users in Ireland, an increase of more than 400% since early last year, and I am confident the target of 500,000 that I have set the industry can be achieved by 2007.</P>

	<P>I understand an interim reply, as well as an acknowledgement, was sent to the Deputy. While the document predates the Freedom of Information Act, my Department considered that it should be dealt with in the context of the principles set out in the Act. This required consideration of issues concerning commercial sensitivity and also the views of the main parties to the report. That consideration was completed in the first half of May but, regrettably, the absence on annual leave of a key official delayed finalisation of the matter.

	<P>Funding of &euro;2 million is available for the programme for funding of small harbours within the overall 2005 fishery harbours development programme. This programme is under consideration at present. The Department receives proposals from local authorities on an ongoing basis. It is difficult to provide a breakdown of the number of applications received in the Department as this changes from year to year. The estimated cost of the number of applications received far exceeds the amount of funding available. Proposals received from local authorities are screened by the Department on the basis of a number of selection criteria. Local authorities tend to prioritise their proposals and the prioritisation does not remain the same year on year.</P>
        <P>Funding for piers, excluding fishery harbour centres and other major harbours, for the counties in question is set out in the following table. The figures include local authority contributions of 25% funding which is required for the majority of the projects.</P>

	<P>The harbour at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its maintenance and development is a matter for the local authority in the first instance.</P>
        <P>In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost of the Ballycotton harbour development plan. The proposed development was estimated to cost a total of &euro;6 million.</P>
        <P>Cork County Council applied for funding in 2002 under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development including a marina at Ballycotton, County Cork. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, their application <Col N="879"/>could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call.</P>
        <P>No funding was available for the grant scheme in 2003 or 2004. The findings of the mid-term review of the regional operational programmes recommended reallocation of funds to other priorities.</P>
        <P>The Ballycotton Harbour Development Association recently submitted a summary of an updated proposed development for Ballycotton Harbour to the Department. The proposed development consists of ten phases over a year and a half and is estimated to cost a total of &euro;3.07 million.</P>
        <P>The allocation for the fishery harbours development programme is &euro;20.55 million for 2005 and a programme for the funding of small harbours within the overall programme is under consideration at present. The fishery harbour programme involves co-funding by the local authorities and the updated proposal for development at Ballycotton would have to be submitted by the local authority. In this case Cork County Council would be required to submit its updated proposal to the Department and be prepared to contribute 25% funding to the project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has, on a number of occasions, made known its concerns to the US Government regarding the treatment and status of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. I reiterated these concerns at meetings with the US National Security Adviser, Steven Hadley, and Deputy Secretary of State, Robert Zoellick, in Washington on 16 March. The United States is well aware of the Government&rsquo;s view that those detained at Guantanamo Bay should be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law. These concerns are shared by our EU partners.</P>
        <P>In expressing these views the Government fully recognises the danger posed by terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda. Together with our EU partners, we are committed to countering all forms of international terrorism. However, it is vital that the highest standards of international human rights and humanitarian law are maintained as we work to counter terrorism.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that the International Committee of the Red Cross has regularly visited the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay since early 2002 for the purpose of monitoring that persons held there are treated in accordance with applicable international laws and standards. I welcome the recent release of a number of detainees from Guantanamo Bay and hope that further releases will follow. I also welcome the investigations which have taken place into alleged abuses of detainees.</P>
        <P>The closure of this facility has become a matter of political debate in the United States. A decision in this regard is a matter for the US authorities and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene. However, I am sure that in their consideration, the US authorities will seek to take account of international public opinion on the matter. I assure the Deputy that in the Government&rsquo;s future contacts with the US Administration, we will continue to raise the need for detainees to be treated in accordance with international law, for alleged abuses to be fully investigated and for persons found guilty of abusing detainees to be punished in accordance with the law.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I particularly appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s interest in the immigration issue in Washington. That issue, and particularly the question of our undocumented people, has the highest priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>In addition to the ongoing work of the Irish Embassy and the consulates in sensitising opinion in the US Congress to our concerns, the Government misses no opportunity to raise the matter in personal contacts with senior US politicians. The Taoiseach and I discussed the issue with President Bush in the White House on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. I raised the matter also with senior Senators and Congressmen during my visit to Washington in February.</P>
        <P>Among those I met then were Senators Kennedy and McCain, who, as the Deputy will be aware, introduced a comprehensive immigration reform Bill on 12 May. The Government has warmly welcomed this draft Bill and regards it as a positive contribution to the debate on immigration reform which, since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, has become an increasingly sensitive and divisive issue in the US. I also met at the time Congressman Sensenbrenner, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, under whose remit immigration matters fall.</P>
        <P>Our ambassador to Washington and his officials maintain frequent and ongoing contacts with the major congressional figures involved in immigration reform and with their aides, and monitor closely all developments regarding reform legislation. These contacts, which will be intensified even further in the period ahead, include the offices of Congressman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Hostetler, chairman of the House Sub-Committee on Immigration. The embassy&rsquo;s particular priority in the period immediately ahead will be to lobby strongly in support of the Kennedy-McCain Bill and to encourage the White House to become actively involved in support of the reform process.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently visited Washington as part of a visit to the US in connection with the issue of undocumented persons and used the occasion to make known to Congressmen the concerns across the political spectrum here on the matter.</P>

        <P>The EPAs are intended first and foremost as instruments for development to foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy, with due regard for their own political choices and their own development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication. They combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework, while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states.</P>
        <P>For instance, recent discussions between the European Commission and the Southern African Development Community, SADC, which has many of the features of a customs union, focussed on how the least developed SADC member countries would be affected by further trade integration under the EPAs. This overall approach addresses the particular concern of Ireland and other member states that development and poverty reduction should be the principal objectives of the EPAs.</P>
        <P>As far as the impacts of liberalisation of trade are concerned, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to article 37(7) of the Cotonou Agreement which states that the negotiations on the EPAs:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries, and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As trade is a European Community competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and the six regional groupings of ACP states. The Commission provides the Council with regular updates on the progress of the negotiations. In this regard, I welcome Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s statement that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations the development dimension is placed first.</P>
        <P>Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations. At the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 24 May, for instance, I drew attention to the concerns which have been expressed, including by <Col N="884"/>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, that the EPAs are not sufficiently development focused. I emphasised that it will be important for the Commission to reassure member states that it is addressing these concerns.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for trade policy. An officer of that Department represents Ireland at meetings of the 133 committee. This committee normally meets once a month at the level of full members. An officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs also attends meetings of the committee on a regular basis. Given the importance for Ireland of trade and trade relations with other countries, including those which are programme countries for Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme, my Department works closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Food, in preparing for meetings of the 133 committee and on questions relating to trade generally, including the EPA negotiations.</P>
        <P>All the programme countries in Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral aid programme &mdash; Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Timor Leste &mdash; are ACP states. In each of these countries, Ireland works in close co-operation with our partner Government, other donors, the private sector and civil society to ensure coherence in our approach across a range of sectors. Among the issues discussed are the impact of EU policies, including EPAs, and the integration of least developed countries, LDCs, into the international trading system. This approach will help build the economic infrastructure in the LDCs which will help employment generation and, ultimately, long-term sustainable development. I do not, however, have the level of detail being sought by Deputy McGrath on employment in particular industries in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>In common with most other countries in the southern Africa region, South Africa is Mozambique&rsquo;s main foreign investor and strong trade links have developed between the two countries in recent years. It would not be appropriate for me to express a view on which specific industries in Mozambique, or indeed any other third country, could sustain competition from South Africa.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</P>
        <P>The allocation to Vote 29, international co-operation, for 2005 is &euro;470.8 million, an increase of &euro;70 million on the 2004 figure. As a result, total official development assistance for 2005 is expected to amount to approximately &euro;545 million when contributions from other Departments have been taken into account. This represents the highest allocation in the 30-year history of the Irish aid programme.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Government has agreed to provide further increases of &euro;65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. These substantial increases mean that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, &euro;1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance. This three-year multi-annual commitment, incorporating substantial annual increases, gives my Department a sound basis to carry forward the long-term planning which is so important for development work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that the EU has recently agreed new targets in regard to ODA. These provide that the EU 15 will reach a new collective target of 0.56% by 2010, while member states which have not yet reached a level of 0.51% undertake to individually reach that by 2010. Member states also undertake to achieve the UN target of 0.7% by 2015. The newer member states, which joined after 2002, have lower targets.</P>
        <P>The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target. The issue of how best to meet the target, and in what timeframe, is under ongoing and active review.</P>

        <P>Following the announcement on 4 May 2005 of the closure of the plant in Dungarvan, I met the Waterford county manager on 10 May 2005. At that meeting, I asked that particular emphasis be put on upskilling the existing workers where necessary and on creating an enterprise culture in the area. I also asked that emphasis be put on developing indigenous industry in the area with a view to expanding existing companies. An interagency forum has been set up to address the situation following the closure announcement. The forum, which is being chaired by the county manager, had its first meeting on 13 May 2005 and is meeting at fortnightly intervals.</P>
        <P>Prior to this, phase one of the site development had been completed on IDA Ireland&rsquo;s industrial park in Dungarvan and the first client had been secured. I am satisfied that the combined efforts of the industrial development agencies, local interests and the forum will continue to address the needs of Dungarvan.</P>
        <P>While I have had no direct discussions with the management of the company in question or the workers concerned, senior representatives from Enterprise Ireland, including the chief executive, have held meetings with the company over the past months to discuss its future strategy. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with the <Col N="889"/>company through its restructuring programme on new product development and in developing its markets to assist the company to meet its new targets.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has been in consultation with the workers concerned and is leading the interagency forum&rsquo;s response to the workers&rsquo; needs in respect of training, development and education. Detailed arrangements are in hand to engage with the workforce when agreement has been reached between the company and staff representatives.

        <Quest>the reason the Health and Safety Authority refused to investigate a fatal road traffic accident which took place on the Culdaff Road, County Donegal, on 12 June 2001 and which resulted in the death of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I express my sincere sympathies to the victim&rsquo;s family on their tragic loss. The remit of the Health and Safety Authority is confined to the investigation of occupational accidents. I understand that this matter was reported to the Health and Safety Authority on 3 June last. The authority contacted the Garda superintendent&rsquo;s office in Buncrana about it and it was confirmed to the authority that this was a traffic accident which had been fully investigated.</P>

	<P>Shannon Development is the statutory agency with responsibility for indigenous industry in the mid-west area which includes north Tipperary. As Shannon Development owns the factory units, there is no rental cost due from the agency. Rent charged by Shannon Development to tenant companies is based on the market value for the unit, having regard to its size and location, and varies accordingly.</P>
        <P>The total number of factories and industrial units owned by Shannon Development in north Tipperary is 85, of which 35 are vacant, 31 for three years or less and four for a longer period. A more detailed breakdown can be provided to the Deputy if requested.</P>

	<P>My Department does not grant-aid such developments directly. Enterprise Ireland has, in the past, managed schemes supporting community enterprise centres.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland approved funding of &euro;123,133 to Ballinasloe Area Community Development Limited for the development of an enterprise centre under its community enterprise centre, CEC, programme for 1989 to 2001, of which &euro;107,904 has been paid and the balance of &euro;15,229 is being processed for payment. A further &euro;38,000 was approved towards the employment of a centre manager under its 2002 CEC programme. The first moiety of this grant of &euro;19,000 has also been paid. I understand that Ballinasloe Area Community Development Limited did not submit a proposal for the development of five new units adjacent to its existing centre in Ballinasloe although it did submit a different proposal which was unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland completed two public calls for proposals from local communities under the CEC 2002 programme. This scheme, announced in 2002 with a fund of &euro;8 million, was a competitive scheme and all the funds have now been fully allocated. Enterprise Ireland is analysing information on 120 Enterprise Ireland supported community enterprise centres nationally to assess the impact that these centres have had both locally and nationally and to determine what role such centres may have in the future with regard to community led enterprise development.</P>

	<P>A total of 12,305 new jobs have been supported by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in the six Border counties over the past five years and details are set out in the following table.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has set a high level performance target for the BMW region, of which the Border counties are an integral part. This commits IDA Ireland to try to achieve a target of 50% of all new greenfield jobs to be located in the Objective One area during the period 2000 to 2006. In this regard, substantial progress has been achieved to date. In 1999, prior to the start of the current national development plan, about 25% of all new greenfield jobs were located in the Objective One area. This rose to an average of 44% in the period 2000 to 2004.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy for 2005 to 2007, transforming Irish industry, which I announced on 4 May 2005, places a strong emphasis on increasing even further the number of new start-ups in the regions and increasing the growth rate of these companies. The agencies&rsquo; policy objectives for balanced regional development are reflected in the structure of their funding offers. The maximum grant levels are higher in the BMW region than in the southern and eastern regions and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable.</P>

	<P>As stated in the question, the judgment in this matter was received on 14 June 2005 and the document runs to 33 pages. The detail of this judgment is being studied by my legal advisers and officials at present. When that process is completed I will consider the next appropriate steps that are open to me. In the meantime I believe it is prudent not to engage in discussion of the content of the inspector&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>While these matters are being considered I wish to assure the Deputy that work is continuing within the labour inspectorate with regard to employment rights compliance in the company concerned. It is my understanding also that other Departments or related offices are proceeding with their respective interactions with the company.</P>

	<P>A decision to fund a client company is a day-to-day matter for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I am directly involved. Enterprise Ireland has informed my Department that Eurocollege Institute of Education, as an internationally traded service company, falls within the remit of Enterprise Ireland. Eurocollege Institute of Education received payments of &euro;2,382 in 2003 and &euro;160,000 in 2004 from Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland publishes payments made to its client companies in conjunction with its annual report. Information on funding approvals is not published, however, because of the commercial sensitivity that attaches to the initial phase of many projects. All funding approved by Enterprise Ireland is subject to a legal agreement and the conditions in the agreement must be met before funding can be drawn down. Enterprise Ireland is not in receipt of a further, formal application for support from the company.</P>

The Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to extend my Department&rsquo;s existing contractual arrangements with An Post gave rise to a procurement complaint being lodged with the European Commission in 2000.

	<P>Child benefit is payable generally to the mother in respect of children who are under 16 years of age, or aged between 16 and 19 and either disabled or in full-time education. Child benefit is paid up to the date certified by the school or college that the child is attending, which in most cases is the end of the academic year in June. The child benefit year runs from June to May and in cases where a child is certified as being in full-time education to June, a payment is made for the month of June by either a renewal book, containing a single voucher, or directly into the customer&rsquo;s bank account.</P>
        <P>The procedure regarding family income supplement, FIS, is where a person has a claim for an only child and that child reaches 18 in April or May a form is issued which is to be stamped by the school. Where the child is sitting the leaving certificate, family income supplement is paid until the end of June. Otherwise FIS is paid until the end of May. Where there are other children in the household, the fact that the child reaches 18 does not affect the FIS payment and it continues to be paid at the same rate until the end of the normal 52 week payment period unless the child signs on for unemployment payment in his or her own right.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 402 together.</P><Col N="898"/>
        <P>My Department has overall responsibility for the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need intensive help and advice in coping with their debt problems. The service is operated by 52 independent companies throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The MABS programme provides money advice to individuals and families who have problems with debt and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. The service places an emphasis on practical budget-based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low cost credit particularly in their local credit union.</P>
        <P>The MABS service has been allocated &euro;13.62 million to ensure the continued development of the service in 2005. This represents an increase of &euro;2.22 million or more than 19% on the 2004 allocation. The allocation this year includes a sum of &euro;1 million to address two particular issues.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that where severe hardship exists in cases of over-indebtedness, MABS customers receive the most appropriate assistance to deal with the situation. The MABS service is considering ways in which support can be provided directly to MABS customers who have particular difficulties with debt problems and to establish a mechanism where this can be dealt with in a practical way. It is envisaged that a specific fund will be established for this purpose which would be administered at a remove from the local money advice and budgeting service. The arrangements are being finalised and I expect to be in a position to announce their commencement in the autumn. This fund will be made available only where conventional avenues of support cannot be of assistance and only in cases of extreme hardship.</P>
        <P>I intend to have a fully automated payment system put in place on a national basis which will allow MABS employees to make direct payments to creditors on behalf of customers and also provide detailed statistics upon demand. These statistics will be invaluable in aiding the future development of MABS by providing a greater understanding of the issues surrounding indebtedness. This new payment system, MABSIS, will be implemented by July 2005. MABS is centred on the needs of the customer and it is vital that the various needs of all customers are met in innovative ways. These initiatives will add another positive dimension to the role of MABS.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the fact that Ireland has the second highest level of child poverty in Europe at 15.7% (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The figure for child poverty in Ireland of 15.7% based on 50% of median national <Col N="899"/>income in 2000 was referred to in the recent Combat Poverty Agency &ldquo;Ending Child Poverty&rdquo; policy statement which, in turn, was drawn from a recent UNICEF report on child poverty.</P>
        <P>As I restated when I launched the agency&rsquo;s statement, tackling child poverty continues to be among my key priorities. Strategies to address child poverty and the measures to give effect to them are set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and in the national children&rsquo;s strategy. The importance of tackling child poverty is reflected in the fact that Ending Child Poverty is one of ten Sustaining Progress special initiatives. One of the key strategies for reducing child poverty is the reduction of the numbers of parents who are unemployed. Our aim is to continue to maintain high levels of employment and to remove obstacles to taking up employment, especially for lone parents and parents with large families.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure to tackle child poverty by my Department has been the substantial increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.50 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Child benefit is paid to more than 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.9 billion in 2005. It delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status.</P>
        <P>Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families, including lone parent families, at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. To address the situation of those children who are most at risk of poverty I am giving serious consideration to the introduction of a second tier of supports, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. A study is being carried out by the NESC on the possibility of amalgamating social welfare child dependant allowances with family income supplement payments, in an effort to channel extra resources to low income families without creating disincentives to employment. In addition, a sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion is examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families and will shortly present its report.</P>
        <P>My Department is also participating in an interdepartmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of <Col N="900"/>services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children. The causes of poverty among children and its effects are multifaceted requiring a multi-policy response. A wide range of data is required to effectively monitor, evaluate and develop such policies. It is for that reason my Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the National Children&rsquo;s Office, are jointly funding a national longitudinal study on children. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study, which is expected to commence later this year.</P>
        <P>Assisting and supporting vulnerable families and their children is one of our main challenges as a society. Through the initiatives we are taking to combat poverty and social exclusion, the Government is giving priority to ensuring that vulnerable families and their children have the share of life chances and quality of life which our prosperity as a nation demands.</P>

        <Quest> his views on the fact that, according to the Combat Poverty Agency policy statement on child poverty, lone parents here have the highest replacement rates and levels of marginal taxation in Europe which is conducive to the formation of poverty traps for lone parents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The findings of the recent Combat Poverty Agency, CPA, policy statement Ending Child Poverty, are based on an analysis of income support packages for families in 22 industrialised countries. The statement indicated that Ireland has the highest replacement rate for lone parents in the 22 countries studied, replacement rates are often defined as the ratio of social welfare benefits to wage-indexed gross earnings, and that these rates are a product of the relatively generous lone parent income support package in Ireland. However, the value of this support is diminished by shortcomings in service provision, especially with regard to child care.</P>
        <P>To continue to make progress in tackling child poverty and poverty in general, the Government is accelerating the implementation of proposals that will address problems that are contributing to child poverty. Particular emphasis is placed on the three critical areas of increased and targeted child income supports, measures to encourage lone parents back to education, training and work and the delivery of additional child care places.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion is examining obstacles to employment for lone parent families, with particular emphasis on income supports, employment, education, child care and support programmes and information. This group is scheduled to report to <Col N="901"/>the Cabinet committee on social inclusion by the end of July.</P>
        <P>We must also look closely at income supports and at how we can adjust those supports to better address the social problems that can arise for those who receive these payments. In this regard, my Department has established a working group to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Issues being addressed include the contingency basis of the one-parent family payment, cohabitation, individualisation, maintenance and secondary benefits. The findings of this group will feed into the work of the senior officials sub-group.</P>
        <P>I am also giving serious consideration to the introduction of a second tier of child income supports, aimed specifically at families in greatest need. A study being carried out by the National Economic and Social Council is examining the possibility of amalgamating social welfare child dependant allowances with family income supplement payments. The objective is to provide an integrated channel for resources to low income families without creating disincentives to employment. It is intended that the outcome of these reviews will contribute to final concrete proposals designed to better support and encourage lone parents in achieving a better standard of living, employment and education opportunities, and a better future for themselves and their children. These will be the main criteria against which recommendations in the reports will be judged. I am committed to reforms that will improve the quality of life for lone parents and their children by offering them respect and support while avoiding poverty traps.</P>

        <P>In the budget for 2001, the Minister for Finance announced a multi-annual programme of increases in child benefit to the value of &euro;1.27 billion over three years, subsequently extended to five years so that the monthly rates payable in respect of the first and second child would increase to &euro;149.20 per month and to &euro;185.40 for the third and subsequent children. Sustaining Progress indicated that the final phase of the planned increases in child benefit rates would be completed in 2004 and 2005. The completion of this programme will be a matter to be considered in the context of the December budget.</P>

	<P>My Department takes a number of measures to ensure that people are aware of possible entitlement to the family income supplement, FIS. These include advising all newly awarded one parent family payment recipients, advising all employers annually in PRSI mailshots and examining entitlement in all awarded back to work allowance cases. Information on FIS is contained in all child benefit books and can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website. In addition, the scheme has previously and extensively been advertised through local and national media outlets, including newspapers and radio, as well as through poster campaigns and targeted mailshots.</P>
        <P>Improvements to the family income supplement scheme, including the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme. My Department will continue to closely monitor the performance of the scheme in terms of uptake and ensure information on all of the Department&rsquo;s schemes is disseminated to the widest possible audience so that people may avail of their entitlements.</P>

	<P>The legislative basis for the application of immobilisation devices to vehicles that are illegally parked on <Col N="903"/>public roads is set out in section 101B of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as inserted by section 9 of the Dublin Transport Authority (Dissolution) Act 1987. Regulations entitled the Road Traffic (Immobilisation of Vehicles) Regulations were made in 1998 to give effect to that section. The regulations include a provision that identifies those classes of persons who may be authorised to apply and remove immobilisation devices and determines that such persons shall consist of members of the Garda, traffic wardens and any person appointed in writing for such purposes by a local authority. As the regulations do not determine that decisions to appoint authorised persons are reserved for the members of local authorities, the making of such decisions is an executive function.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Irish driving licence regulations are required to operate within the framework of a harmonised EU system. The criteria essential for recognition of licences from other countries are testing and licensing regimes, which meet the requirements of the EU directive on driving licences, and reciprocal recognition of Irish licences. Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement with the United States of America for the exchange of driving licences due to the diverse nature of the driver testing and licensing regimes in the different states in the USA. On taking up Irish residence a person who holds a driving licence issued in the USA must obtain a provisional licence and undergo a driving test to obtain a driving licence. Temporary visitors to Ireland who hold a national driving licence or an international driving permit may drive here for the duration of their visit. The driver licensing requirements in the USA are a matter for the USA licensing authorities.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan in its current form is a draft consultation document that is likely to be significantly amended before it is finalised. However, it does contain major commitments with regard to the accessibility of Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles for people <Col N="904"/>with mobility and sensory impairments. I am happy to inform the Deputy that practically the entire urban bus fleets of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are comprised of low floor, fully accessible vehicles. The only exceptions are a small number of older vehicles in Cork, which are not part of the regular bus fleet. Under the sectoral plan the company will continue to purchase only fully accessible vehicles for its urban services.</P>
        <P>The sectoral plan notes that in recent years Bus &Eacute;ireann has begun introducing low floor wheelchair accessible buses on a trial basis on some commuter routes previously served by inaccessible vehicles. It is hoped to note further progress in this area when the plan is being finalised. At present the inter-urban services provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann are inaccessible for people in wheelchairs. This is because, to date, the company has not been able to source suitable accessible vehicles. This problem is not unique to Bus &Eacute;ireann and European-wide efforts are under way to address the issue. In that regard, Bus &Eacute;ireann is participating in an EU research study into the scope for developing accessible coaches and long distance buses.</P>
        <P>The sectoral plan states that Bus &Eacute;ireann will begin the process of replacing its inter-urban fleet with wheelchair accessible vehicles as soon as suitable vehicles become available. I am engaging with the public transport accessibility committee, which operates under the aegis of my Department, to ensure that the members of the committee are fully consulted with regard to the contents of the sectoral plan.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The DTO initiated a pilot programme for six safer routes to school projects during the course of the period 2002 to 2003. These were in Griffith Avenue involving four separate schools: Donabate, two schools; Malahide, one school; Bray, one school; Lucan, one school; and Shankill, one school. Subsequently, the schools in Lucan and Shankill decided not to continue participating in the initiative.</P>
        <P>This pilot programme was designed to show what needs to be done to achieve a better balance in the modes used to travel to school. The pilot programme consisted of: implementing a set of infrastructure improvements in the road environment surrounding each school; and organis<Col N="906"/>ational and consultation activities intended to show school management and parent committees how to manage the mobility needs of the children attending the school.</P>
        <P>The total cost of the programme was &euro;1.66 million, predominantly for the infrastructure changes, for example, pedestrian crossing, cycle paths, cycle parking facilities within school grounds, bus lay-bys, etc. No moneys have been expended on projects during 2005. The DTO contributed considerable in-house resources to managing the initiative through extensive liaison with stakeholders and through the preparation of documentation, surveys etc.</P>
        <P>The following table shows the breakdown of moneys allocated to each school project, and also the outcome in terms of changes to behaviour and mode choices made by pupils and their parents. The table shows that the results of the pilot programme are encouraging. The main finding of the pilot project was that a school requires a well-developed and interested parent-school team to bring the initiative to fruition. Simply providing infrastructure without the managerial effort of parents, pupils and school managers is likely to fail.</P>
        <P>The DTO is examining the potential of widening the scope of the initiative by arranging for the inclusion of a school travel theme within the existing green schools programme. The green schools programme is run by An Taisce and is already present in over half the schools across the country, with the rate of subscription growing. The programme has the potential to assist working groups involving parents, pupils and staff to develop a school travel plan to increase the numbers of pupils walking, cycling or taking the bus to school and to reduce the number of cars coming to the school.</P>
        <P>I have asked the DTO to advise me as to how this initiative might be advanced, with a view to getting implementation in a wider range of schools throughout the country.</P><Col N="905"/>

	<P>There has been no reduction in funding available under the local development social inclusion programme in 2005. Funding of &euro;42.144 million and &euro;45.7 million was provided in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2004 and 2005 respectively. I have been informed by ADM that it does not directly fund this group.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, one of the functions of Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body established under the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, is to examine the possible restoration of the Ulster Canal. At this time, no decision has been taken to proceed with the restoration of the Ulster Canal and, in view of the current &ldquo;care and maintenance&rdquo; mode in which the North-South bodies are operating, the Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of advancing the issue at this time.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, a study was commissioned which estimated the cost of the restoration of the full Ulster Canal at approximately £90 million stg based on year 2000 costs. Matters arising in regard to the project, including the question of whether a phased or partial approach might be feasible, remain under consideration by my Department and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 to 429, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (amendment) Regulations, 2001 contained in SI 538 of 2001 introduced, <i>inter alia</i>, a statutory consent system for afforestation. The regulations cover the consultation procedures for both prescribed bodies and the general public, together with environmental impact assessment procedures for afforestation.</P><Col N="911"/>
        <P>The types of cases processed under SI 538 are those where the site is within a proposed NHA, SAC, SPA or national park, contains an archaeological site or feature with intensive public usage or is within a prime scenic area in the county development plan, or is within an area listed in the inventory of outstanding landscapes.</P>
        <P>Applications subject to the public consultations under SI 538 are advertised in the relevant local press indicating reference number, county, townland, district electoral division and area to be planted. Interested parties are invited to seek further information in relation to any observations or submissions they may wish to make. In addition, any application for afforestation of an area in excess of 2.5 hectares is subject to public notification whether or not it is covered by the provisions of SI 538. Notification is made through the newspapers circulating in the district of the proposed afforestation and includes information similar to that outlined above for public consultation cases. In addition, all applications are thoroughly examined by the forest inspectorate of my Department, which includes specialists in the area of archaeology, ecology and landscape-architecture and are referred as required to the various prescribed bodies.</P>
        <P>A total of 6,606 applications for funding have been processed by the Forest Service of my Department since the introduction of SI 538 in 2001, of which 6,189 were approved for funding. A total of 545 of the applications received were subject to the provisions of SI 538, of which 473 were approved for funding. Of those applications which were subject to SI 538, applications in NHAs, SACs, SPAs and national parks accounted for 331; areas containing an archaeological site or feature with intensive public use came to 127; while prime scenic or amenity areas in a county development plan or listed in an inventory of outstanding landscapes came to 353. As will be seen a considerable number of the applications would have multiple referrals.</P>
        <P>Conditions of approval of applications are not recorded in a register at present. The conditions are recorded on the individual files and must be strictly adhered to in order to form the basis of grant payment. This information is not published after a decision has been made, nor does any information appear at present on the Department&rsquo;s website. However, information in relation to the decisions is freely available to the public on request and my Department is actively looking at ways of improving the flow of information in the context of the greater flexibility which will be offered by the new IFORIS system when introduced later this year.</P>
        <P>In relation to applications processed under SI 538, the information given to the prescribed bodies includes the following details: (1) environmental considerations relating to the site; (2) species proposed; (3) general site data, for example, elevation, soil type etc.; and (4) oper<Col N="912"/>ational proposals, that is, drainage, stocking, access, fertiliser weed control etc. A map of the site is also given. Information on the content and rationale of decisions relating to these applications is available to the referral bodies on request.</P>
        <P>The number of applications in excess of 2.5 hectares processed since SI 538 was 5,782. All were subject to the public notification or consultation system described above, as appropriate.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000, SI 127 of 2000, provides that adequate care and attention must be maintained with regard to the health and welfare of farm animals. In March of this year my Department issued a notice under regulation 7 of the above regulations requiring the person concerned to comply with certain conditions in relation to the welfare of sheep kept on his holding. As these conditions had not been complied with and the condition of the sheep continued to deteriorate my Department was obliged to issue a notice on 7 April under regulation 10 of the above regulations seizing the sheep concerned and removing them from the farm.</P>
        <P>In accordance with normal practice, as provided for in regulation 10(4) of the above regulations, any funds accruing from the disposal of these sheep will be paid to the farmer concerned less the costs incurred by my Department in connection with the seizure and disposal of these animals.</P>

	<P>The premises referred to are owned by a private company. It is the responsibility of the directors and management of a company to manage property owned by it and to ensure that its property is safe and does not constitute a danger to the public. The timing for the disposal or retention of the tanks referred to and any material held therein is also a matter for the directors of the company. Should the company resolve to remove the tanks or any residue of material therein, my Department would have a supervisory role in the removal of the product and the cleaning of the tanks on the property. In the meantime, my Department carries out checks of the storage facilities on a regular basis.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland implemented the single payment scheme in January 2005. The special beef premium scheme, along with the slaughter premium scheme, were the only schemes where the deadline for receipt of applications was 31 December 2004. This meant that as many farmers as possible submitted their applications in late December 2004 in order that they could benefit from the special beef premium. Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.4 million animals were lodged, of which almost 1.4 million were quota animals, that is, first age-bull animals. The application figure in each of the three previous years was 1.9 million animals.</P>
        <P>The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and following a widespread public consultation process. A very persuasive factor in this process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states who fully decoupled would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns, both in terms of total numbers of animals applied <Col N="914"/>upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case.</P>
        <P>I am fully aware of the impact that the overshoot reduction will have on farmers who claimed on more than 25 animals. I am seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner. I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions during various meetings. My Department also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter on 25 April 2005 and a meeting between my officials and the various services of the Commission&rsquo;s DG Agri took place last week. The matter has also been discussed with the Commissioner&rsquo;s cabinet and with the most senior officials of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to avail of every opportunity to press for appropriate measures to be put in place to alleviate the difficulties encountered by Irish beef farmers as a result of the ending of the special beef premium in 2004.</P>

	<P>The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category C. Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under the livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002. The application under this category is being processed at present and he will be notified of his eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications received are processed.</P>
        <P>In excess of 17,500 applications have been received under the national reserve at the Department&rsquo;s office in Castlebar. In view of the applications received and the documentation submitted, it will be some time before a decision is <Col N="915"/>reached on whether the person named is entitled to an allocation from the reserve.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 452 together.</P><Col N="920"/>
        <P>The price of milk paid to dairy farmers is a commercial matter between milk producers and milk purchasers and I have no direct role in this area. Milk prices are influenced by a number of factors, both internal and external. These include the structure of our domestic dairy operations, the prices paid in international markets for dairy products, the type and final destination of product and the overall operation of the EU market support mechanisms.</P>
        <P>The Luxembourg agreement in 2003 provided that the intervention price for milk products would reduce in the period 2004-2007 and these reductions would be compensated by the introduction of a direct payment. In 2004 farmers were compensated to an amount of &euro;60 million or 1.2 cent per litre. Further compensation of 2.4 cent per litre, amounting to &euro;120 million, will be paid this year as part of the single farm payment and this will rise to 3.6 cent per litre equivalent, or &euro;180 million, in 2006. This payment, taken together with the market value of milk has resulted in a higher return for dairy farmers in 2005.</P>
        <P>As regards market management at EU level, I have consistently challenged the reduction in support level implemented by the Commission in recent months in view of the negative effect these will have on the dairy sector. I secured strong support for my position from a number of member states at the May Agriculture Council meeting. In my view, it is crucially and strategically important that the EU consolidates its international market share while challenging competition on its domestic market. I have urged the Commission to maintain a competitive combination of aids and subsidies to achieve these objectives.</P>
        <P>As regards the maintenance of commercial dairy farms, the Agri Vision 2015 committee concluded that following the reductions in intervention prices for dairy products and given the preference for part-time farming, dairy farm numbers are expected to decline. However, I strongly believe that if the dairy sector is to maintain a competitive position we must look at increasing the scale of operations, reducing costs where possible, and encouraging a profitable future in the sector based on market returns.</P>
        <P>The Luxembourg agreement has extended the quota regime until 2014-15 and, working within that framework, I have made changes to the milk quota regulations which will allow dairy farmers to plan ahead with greater certainty, thereby enabling the restructuring programme to operate more effectively having regard to the need for more competitive milk production.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland implemented the single payment scheme in January 2005. The special beef premium scheme, along with the slaughter premium scheme, were the only schemes where the deadline for receipt of applications was 31 December 2004. This meant that as many farmers as possible submitted their applications in late December 2004 in order that they could benefit from the special beef premium. Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.4 million animals were lodged, of which almost 1.4 million were quota animals, that is first age-bull animals. The application figure in each of the three previous years was 1.9 million animals.</P>
        <P>The decision to opt for full decoupling was arrived at following careful consideration of all options and following a widespread public consultation process. A very persuasive factor in this process was the suggestion that farmers in those member states who fully decoupled would not be disadvantaged during the transitional period. The level of overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns, both in terms of total numbers of animals applied upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner. I have already raised the issue with the Commissioner on a number of occasions during various meetings. My Department also forwarded a detailed submission to the European Commission dealing with this matter on 25 April 2005 and a meeting between my officials and the various services of the Commission&rsquo;s DG Agri took place last week. The matter has also been discussed with the Commissioner&rsquo;s cabinet and with the most senior officials of the European Commission.</P>
        <P>I am continuing to avail of every opportunity to press for appropriate measures to be put in place to alleviate the difficulties encountered by Irish beef farmers as a result of the ending of the special beef premium in 2004. Given the current position with regard to the processing of the 2004 scheme and the ongoing discussions with the Agriculture Commissioner on the overshoot, it is not possible at this stage to be definitive about the issues raised by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it has proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision has been made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>As participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming had retired before the start of the reference period in 2000, they are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, a concession agreed with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming. Only landholders actively engaged in farming can receive entitlements from the national reserve.</P>
        <P>It was open to participants in the current early retirement scheme, who would have farmed during part or all of the reference period, to activate entitlements in 2005 and lease them to their existing transferee. If the transferee did not want the <Col N="924"/>entitlements, the transferor, the retired farmer, who has already activated the entitlements has until 2007 within which to lease or transfer the entitlements with land to another farmer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 451 and 456 together.</P>
        <P>The EU preliminary draft budget for 2006 in respect of milk and milk products is currently under negotiation and I have signalled my disquiet on the level of funding proposed for the sector.</P>
         <?oasys _ic20-?><P>I am anxious the dairy sector is provided with sufficient resources to ensure adequate support in meeting both internal and external market challenges. The draft budget reflects the Commission view on how the market is likely to perform and the consequent demands for export subsidies in the market and the level of product aids required under the disposal schemes currently available.</P>
        <P>In this regard I have strenuously opposed recent reductions in dairy processing aids and export subsidies proposed by the Commission, which have resulted in lower spending on the budget for milk and milk products. These EU market management measures are essential components in enabling the dairy industry compete on world markets. In my contacts with the Commissioner and during the Council discussion on 30 May I emphasised that unless these supports were viewed in a market rather than a budget context, they would be less effective in meeting their commercial objectives and would prevent EU processors and exporters from availing of current opportunities on the world market.</P>
        <P>Stability in the current period is essential so that the industry is in a position to consolidate its international market share, develop its product portfolio and respond to further trade liberalisation under the next WTO round. I am committed to the maintenance of the range of market measures currently available so that the <Col N="925"/>EU dairy sector is fully equipped to export surplus dairy products in the more competitive world market that will emerge after the Doha round is finalised.</P>

	<P>Agreement was reached in August 2004 on a framework which sets out the overall outline and structure of the next World Trade Organisation agreement. The detailed implementation of the framework agreement is the subject of on-going negotiation at technical and political level with the aim of concluding an agreement at the WTO ministerial conference in December 2005.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy insofar as the EU&rsquo;s internal market supports are concerned. My priorities for the further negotiations are to ensure that: the arrangements for the liberalisation of market access will protect the interests of Irish producers and processors on domestic and EU markets; the phasing out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the framework agreement, thereby ensuring equal competition for all exporters on the world market; and the phasing out period for export subsidies will be as long as possible to allow Irish producers and exporters time to adjust.</P>
        <P>My overriding objective will be to ensure that the terms of a new agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

	<P>Commission Regulation 1215/2003 sets down the EU requirements with regard to mechanical classification. In addition, national legislation was adopted in Ireland in 2004 which further details the requirements for its operation, including the type and level of penalty for any infringements.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, two levels of inspection concerning the operation of the mechanical classification <Col N="926"/>system are carried out by my Department at the slaughter plants. A classification supervisor visits each slaughter plant to ensure that all of the requirements regarding classification are in order. In the early stages of mechanical classification the frequency of these visits was set at once per week. The frequency is currently maintained at twice per month. From January to May of this year, a total of over 400 inspections, at this level, were carried out.</P>
        <P>In compliance with EU regulatory requirements, a more detailed inspection is carried out by a national standards panel. For these inspections, a very detailed assessment of the operation of the machines is carried out, including an analysis of the accuracy of classification, using the system of points and tolerances as utilized in the original authorisation test. Since the installation of the machines, in November 2004, almost 200 inspections of this nature have been carried out and over 14,000 individual carcasses have been checked.</P>
        <P>These inspections have shown that the mechanical classification system is operating well within the requirements of the EU regulation and that the calibration of the equipment is satisfactory.</P>

	<P>The position is that the persons concerned, a woman and her three children, arrived in the State in November 2001 and claimed asylum. Their asylum applications was examined, in turn, by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, both of whom concluded that the persons concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. These positions were conveyed in writing to the persons concerned.</P>
        <P>The persons concerned were notified of my decision to refuse them a declaration of refugee status by letter dated 30 December 2002. They were informed in this letter of the three options open to them at that point, namely, to leave the State before their case was considered for deportation, to consent to the making of deportation orders in respect of them or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why they should not be deported or why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Their case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, having <Col N="928"/>due regard for the representations submitted by and on behalf of the persons concerned. Consideration was given to all representations received on this family&rsquo;s behalf, including those from the Castleblayney committee. On 11 February 2005 deportation orders were made in respect of the persons concerned. The orders were served on them by registered post together with a covering letter requiring them to attend at the offices of the Garda national immigration bureau in order that travel arrangements could be put in place to effect their return to their country of origin. The persons concerned were deported from the State on 14 March 2005 by charter flight.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the asylum applications and requests for leave to remain in the State made by the persons concerned were examined comprehensively and fairly. As a result, it is not my intention to further review this case. In regard to the consideration process generally and the making of deportation orders, I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 66 of 12 April 2005.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy was informed in my reply to her previous parliamentary question on this subject, &ldquo;the central tenet of the visa process in this State has been and continues to be that the onus is at all times on the applicant to satisfy my Department that it would be appropriate to issue them with a visa. In the case of the applications in question, the applicants failed to do so.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>With regard to any fresh applications that may be submitted by the applicants, they would first need to address the specific omission of a birth certificate in relation to the child named on application No. 1547219.</P>
        <P>It is important to state at the outset that it will not always be possible for an applicant to address the concerns raised by my Department. The reality is that not every individual is, for one reason or another, eligible or suitable for the grant of a visa. Were it to be the case that every application could ultimately result in the grant of a visa, there would be little point in operating a visa system in the first place. However, the visa application process and, where applicable, subsequent entitlement to appeal, provides individuals with the opportunity to demonstrate to my Department that they themselves are in fact both eligible and suitable for the grant of an Irish visa.</P>
        <P>Every visa application is assessed on its own merits, having regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the appli<Col N="929"/>cant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of remaining in the State. The Department&rsquo;s approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. Common examples of previous abuse include individuals who although granted a visa to come on short visits, overstayed with a view to establishing themselves permanently in the State.</P>
        <P>In this specific case the failure of the applicants to satisfy my Department that they would necessarily observe the conditions of the visas applied for, were they to issue, directly resulted in the refusal of the applications. The onus is on the applicant to provide the appropriate documentation and information, unique to an individual, which will allow a visa officer make an informed assessment of the immigration risk posed, if any, by the applicant. Only the applicant can decide how best to present this information in order to create a generally satisfactory impression of their bona fides. They must demonstrate that their intentions are as stated and that they have, for example, sufficient obligations to return home so as to guarantee their observance of the conditions of the visa. This information may include, for example, evidence of social, economic, family or professional ties in their country of origin, or prior travel histories to other jurisdictions operating similar immigration systems as Ireland, such as the United Kingdom or the United States, or indeed many of the other EU member states.</P>
        <P>As these applications were refused in January 2005, the timeframe during which an appeal could be lodged has expired. Consequently, it is not possible to facilitate any further action in relation to these applications.</P>

        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State before the date of the application and a total of four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight years preceding that period. For the purposes of calculating this residency, no period may be reckoned <Col N="930"/>in respect of which a non-national either was required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State but did not have such permission, or had permission to remain for the purpose of study or for the purpose of seeking to be recognised as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>My officials have sought confirmation from the person concerned that he has the necessary reckonable residence in the State on the date he applied. To date, he has been unable to produce such confirmation and my Department&rsquo;s letter dated 10 May 2005, setting out the exact details that are required, has not yet been responded to. I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy when I have made a decision on the application.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 461 and 462 together.</P>
        <P>The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 provide for notification to, and inspection by, the Health Service Executive of pre-school child care services. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cr&egrave;ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.</P>
        <P>Information provided to the Department of Health and Children by the Health Service Executive indicates that the number of places known to be notified for pre-school children at the end of December 2004 was 80,127. This is based on notifications to and inspections by the Health Service Executive, formerly the health boards. The number of pre-school places broken down by category of service as requested by the Deputy is not routinely available. My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has indicated that he will ask the Health Service Executive to provide this information directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>Because child care is provided by a mix of community based not for profit groups and private providers, together with the childminding sector which largely falls outside the scope of the child <Col N="931"/>care regulations, there is no mechanism for gathering statistics of the actual numbers and age range of children who avail of child care in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Central Statistics Office conducted a survey of child care arrangements by families as part of the national quarterly household survey cycle and found that 73,000 families with pre-school aged children and 67,000 families with school going children regularly avail of non-parental child care arrangements, which was defined as any form of child care other than that provided directly by parents or guardians themselves which is availed of on a regular weekly basis during the normal working week. This would encompass care by paid and unpaid relatives, paid carer or childminder, centre based child care such as a cr&egrave;che or Montessori and other forms of child care. However, this research does not quantify the numbers of children availing of childcare.</P>
        <P>The equal opportunities childcare programme provides funding for the development childcare services through the two regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The total funding available for the programme is &euro;499.3 million. A considerable amount of data regarding the equal opportunities childcare programme and its impact is routinely collected. This data indicates that since 2002 the numbers of children attending centre based childcare services supported under the programme has risen from approximately 17,800, in 2002, to more than 35,400 in 2004.</P>

	<P>As you are aware, the rejection by ballot of the proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service resulted in the closure of the Curragh place of detention as a cost reduction measure. This possibility had been clearly flagged to staff for some time prior to the vote on the negotiated deal.</P>
        <P>Following the closure of the Curragh place of detention, 65 staff, of mixed grades, were due to be redeployed. The staff concerned were given time to indicate their preferred location for re-assignment and this was extended at the request of the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. To date, 31 of these staff have been given their permanent reassignment. It is expected that the remaining 34, who are currently temporarily assigned to the <Col N="932"/>Midlands Prison, will be notified of their permanent assignment within the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>My Department has also effected 29 consequential long standing transfers to and from a number of institutions, including Arbour Hill, Cloverhill, Cork, Midlands, Mountjoy, Wheatfield and Portlaoise Prisons and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. Every effort is being made to accommodate staff, as far as practicable, with a location of their preference or a suitable alternative. However, the needs of the service still have to remain our priority.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State in December 2001 and claimed asylum. He was requested by registered letter to attend the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for interview on 15 May 2002 pursuant to his application for refugee status in the State. He failed to present on that occasion. A follow up letter issued to him by registered post rescheduling his interview for 15 July 2002. He again failed to present as requested. Pursuant to the provisions of section 11(9) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, the application of the person concerned was deemed to be withdrawn. A notice dated 18 July 2002 issued from the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommending that the person referred to by the Deputy should not be declared a refugee.</P>
        <P>He was notified of my decision to refuse him refugee status by registered letter dated 6 September 2002 and afforded three options, namely, leave the State before his case was considered for deportation, consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him, submit to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform within 15 working days written representations setting out reasons why he should not be deported or why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. No representations were received either from or on behalf of this person.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement). On 7 August 2003 a deportation order was made in respect of him. The order was served on him by registered letter dated 2 October 2003. The removal from the State of the person concerned is therefore now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB.</P>

        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 16 May 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for asylum on 30 September 2003. His application was considered at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner who concluded that the person concerned did not meet the criteria for recognition as a refugee. This position was communicated to the person concerned by letter dated 30 November 2004. The person concerned appealed this recommendation to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal who, following an examination of the person&rsquo;s appeal, affirmed the earlier recommendation. The outcome of this appeal was communicated to the person concerned by letter dated 19 May 2005. The decision of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was to affirm the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
        <P>This person&rsquo;s file has been forwarded to my Department&rsquo;s ministerial decisions unit and he will, in accordance with the usual practice, be informed that the Minister concurs with the recommendation made in this case, that is, not to grant refugee status. The person concerned will also be informed of the options open to him under the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, that is, to leave the State before his case is considered for deportation, consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him, make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons why he should not be deported or why he should be allowed remain temporarily in the State.</P>

        <P>If the level of the worker&rsquo;s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for FIS payments, the application for a visa is generally refused. In this case it was evident that the level of income would come within the ambit of qualifying for FIS payments.</P>
        <P>It is open to the applicant to appeal the decision to refuse the visa, within two months of notification of the refusal of the visa to the applicant. The material in support of the appeal should address the reason for refusal.</P>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State as an unaccompanied minor in September 2002 and claimed asylum. His application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. My decision to refuse him a declaration of refugee status was communicated to him by registered letter dated 30 April 2004. This letter advised him of the three options open to him at that point: to leave the State voluntarily before his case was considered for deportation; to consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him; or, to make written representations, within 15 working days, setting out the reasons why he should not be deported, that is, why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was considered under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 &mdash; prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>&mdash; having due regard for all representations received on his behalf. A deportation order was made in respect of the person concerned on 13 December 2004. This order was served on the person concerned by registered letter dated 7 February 2005. This letter made the person concerned aware of the requirement that he present himself at the offices of the Garda national immigration bureau on a specified date in order that arrangements could be made for his removal from the State. He presented at the Garda national immigration bureau as required.</P>
        <P>Although the person concerned was a minor when he first entered the State, he turned 18 years of age in May of this year and is now being treated as an adult. However, my Department gave an undertaking, on 4 April 2005, to the Health Service Executive, in whose care the person concerned then was, that he would not be removed from the State until after he had completed his leaving certificate examinations in June 2005. However, the deportation order remains in place and its enforcement is an operational matter for the Garda national immigration bureau.</P>

He was refused refugee status in the State following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.

        <P>Representations for temporary leave to remain in the State were made on behalf of the person concerned by his legal representatives.

	<P>The CONNECT project was launched in 2000 as part of the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s training and development programme. The project was established in Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit with the support of the National Training and Development Institute, NTDI. A process of internal review during 2002, prompted a refocusing of the project prior to its roll-out to further institutions. In particular, the review identified the need for new management structures so as to better support the project&rsquo;s sentence management processes in the delivering institutions. The review process inevitably impacted on the target dates in the original roll-out schedule. While the CONNECT project is being extended to Limerick Prison, the projects at Mountjoy Prison, the D&oacute;chas Centre and the training unit have been affected by the current industrial relations and financial restrictions.</P>
        <P>These will resume operations, if and when, there is a successful outcome to the current industrial relations process with the Prison Officers <Col N="941"/>Association, POA. As the Deputy will be aware, the members of the POA recently rejected the proposal for organisational change in the prison service. In the current circumstances, therefore, it is not envisaged that the refocused CONNECT project will be extended to all prisons by the originally envisaged target date of the end of 2006.</P>

	<P>The applications in question were for the stated purposes of allowing four non-EEA nationals travel to the State to visit a relative who is resident here.</P>
        <P>In assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa, for example, if it is unlikely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin. The applications in question were refused on 16 March 2005 because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department in support of the applications, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. It is open to the persons in question to submit fresh applications supported by current documentation should they still wish to travel.</P>

        <Quest>the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been compensated in the past ten years regarding their involvement in shooting incidents; the reason there is such a delay with respect to impending cases; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1995, almost 3,000 Garda compensation files have been opened under the provisions of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945. The information requested by the Deputy with regard to shooting incidents in the past ten years is not readily available. The information could be <Col N="945"/>obtained only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources and, accordingly, cannot be ascertained within the timeframe for answering this question.</P>
        <P>In general, there is no one reason why delays may occur in the progressing of an application for compensation under the Acts. A backlog of applications occurred a number of years ago due initially to two judicial review cases which changed the manner in which claims are processed and then because of the death of the Garda surgeon and the time taken in replacing him with the Garda chief medical officer.</P>
        <P>Delays may also occur from the late submission by a member of his or her application to my Department. The initial delay in making the application by a member may range from over three months to several years following the date of the incident. The majority of late applications are from one to three years, approximately.</P>
        <P>There are also delays in receiving all medical reports, particularly final medical reports from the applicants or their legal advisers. It is the practice of the Garda chief medical officer not to give an appointment to see the applicant until all relevant medical reports, including final medical reports, have been received in order that a comprehensive report can be formulated.</P>
        <P>Within my Department it can take time to make necessary additional inquiries because of the seriousness of the injuries received and the circumstances of the incident. However, every effort is made to keep administrative delays to a minimum. I agree that applications for compensation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts should be dealt with within a reasonable timeframe and that delays in processing applications for compensation should be avoided where possible. In this regard, my Department has taken steps to devote additional staff resources to deal with such applications.</P>
        <P>Within my area of responsibility, I am taking steps to establish a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na compensation tribunal, along the lines recommended by the committee set up in 1997 to review and make recommendations on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945.</P>
        <P>The background to this initiative is that the committee set up in 1997 consisted of representatives from the Departments of Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, Garda management and two Garda associations &mdash; the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association. A medical practitioner who had experience of life assurance work was also on the committee which was chaired by an independent chairman. The committee presented its report to the then Minister on 28 August 1997.</P>
        <P>The committee made 14 recommendations which included the repeal of the existing Acts and <Col N="946"/>the setting up of a new Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na compensation tribunal on a statutory basis. The tribunal will operate along the same lines as the criminal injuries compensation tribunal, the main difference being that garda&iacute; would be compensated for &ldquo;pain and suffering&rdquo;. It is envisaged that trainee garda&iacute; who suffer malicious injuries prior to attestation would be covered under the new scheme and that claims already refused under the existing Acts as being minor would be allowed go before the tribunal.</P>
        <P>The establishment of a Garda compensation tribunal has been agreed by the Garda staff associations. My Department is in consultation with the law officers about certain issues arising from the introduction of a compensation tribunal.</P>

	<P>The applications referred to by the Deputy were for the stated purposes of allowing two non-EEA nationals travel to the State for a short term visit.</P>
        <P>In assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa, for example, whether it is likely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in his or her country of origin. The applications in question were refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied with the application, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed evidence of how they intended supporting themselves financially during their proposed stay in the State, or of obligations to return home following the proposed visit. The applications were refused on 16 February 2005.</P>
        <P>An appeal in respect of the applications was received on 3 May 2005. However, based on the additional information supplied, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently, these applications were refused on appeal on 27 May 2005. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, fresh applications must be lodged should the applicants still wish to travel.</P>

	<P>The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State on 13 March 2002 and applied for asylum. She was refused refugee status in the State following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. She was informed of these recommendations by letters dated 10 October 2002 and 10 February 2003 respectively.</P>
        <P>A notification under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999 issued to the person concerned on 28 March 2003 advising her of my decision to refuse to give her a declaration of refugee status and setting out the options open to her at that point; namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why she should not be deported.</P>
        <P>Representations for temporary leave to remain in the State were made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representatives. The case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), having due regard for the representations received, following which, on 11 May 2005, a deportation order was made in respect of the person concerned. She was notified of this decision by letter dated 10 June 2005. That letter made her aware that she was required to present herself, on 16 June 2005, at the offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau in order that arrangements could be made for her removal from the State. She presented as requested and is due to present again on 23 June 2005 at 10 am.</P>
        <P>The person concerned arrived in the State as an adult, accompanied by her parents and they all independently applied for asylum. Each of these claims was examined in a comprehensive and fair manner. Additionally, the case made by the person concerned for leave to remain temporarily in the State was examined in detail, following which the decision was taken to issue a deportation order in respect of her. There is no basis for requesting the Garda National Immigration Bureau to postpone the enforcement of her deportation order. Accordingly, the deportation order remains in place and its enforcement is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am further also advised that the personnel strength of the Tipperary Garda division as at 16 June 2005 was 313, all ranks, compared to 297 as <Col N="950"/>at 1 January 1998. This represents an increase of 16, or 5.3%, in the number of personnel allocated to Tipperary division since that date.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P>With regard to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Tipperary division will be considered in the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing where they will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, 213 garda&iacute; and civilian staff are scheduled to move to Thurles by 2008. In advance of this, my Department is currently in the process of identifying, from the central applications facility, civilian personnel for transfer to the Garda central vetting unit and the Garda criminal records office, the two units which have been selected for early decentralisation to Thurles. Temporary accommodation for these offices has been identified at the Tipperary technology park in Thurles. The sketch scheme has been signed off for this temporary accommodation and it is expected to have these units in occupation by end September 2005.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in respect of the complete move, a site has been identified in Thurles to facilitate construction of suitable permanent accommodation for all the units which are being decentralised. The terms of the sale are now well advanced and, when the site has been acquired, the Office of Public Works will prepare a brief of requirements for the accommodation to be provided.</P>
        <P>In addition, a working group has been established under the chairmanship of the Assistant <Col N="952"/>Commissioner, strategy and services, to examine and draft a brief of requirements for the new Garda IT centre at Thurles. A determination will be made in due course as to the specific posts that will be required for the setting up of this centre.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that applications for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP 2000-2006, were submitted by a number of groups in the areas in question to my Department some time ago.</P>
        <P>The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the current programme. Following discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available for the period 2005-09, in the context of the 2005 budget.</P>
        <P>This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;499.3 million and the amount set aside for capital developments to &euro;205 million. The availability of the additional capital funding will enable me to make capital grant assistance available to groups which can show that they address significant child care service gaps and where their project proposals represent good value for money when considered in relation to the current guidelines on building costs.</P>
        <P>In light of this, some groups in the areas in question which have applied for capital grant assistance, were advised in December 2004, that while their projects had not been prioritised for immediate funding at that stage, they would be reconsidered for possible support in the future. The assessments on some of these projects have recently been completed by Area Development Management Limited, which administers the grants on my behalf. They are now under consideration by the EOCP appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, following which I will make a final decision on funding for the groups. The applicants will be informed of the outcome in due course.</P>
        <P>Of the total funding committed to date, almost &euro;5.5 million has been committed to child care projects in the Ballyfermot area. Since budget 2005, I have announced a record allocation totalling some &euro;66 million in capital funding to community based not for profit groups, in two tranches, one in December 2004 and another on 4 March 2005. I hope to make further significant <Col N="953"/>capital allocations in the very near future and thereafter during the remainder of 2005.</P>

	<P>The visa application in question was for the stated purpose of allowing a non-EEA national travel to the State for a short term visit.</P>
        <P>In assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa, for example, whether it is likely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in his or her country of origin.</P>
        <P>In the case in question, the visa officer was not reasonably satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant demonstrated that he would observe the conditions of the visa applied for. Additionally, the visa officer concluded that the applicant had not demonstrated sufficient evidence of a clear, pre-existing link between the applicant and the sponsor. There is a general reluctance to approve visas for persons whose sole reference in Ireland has never met them or has met them only once during a brief visit abroad. The application was refused on 19 November 2004.</P>
        <P>A letter was received from a solicitor representing the applicant on 24 January 2005 stating an intention to appeal. However, no appeal was received within the permitted timeframe. A letter issued from my Department to the solicitor on 11 May to this effect, informing them that the opportunity to appeal had now passed.</P>
        <P>It is of course still open to the person in question to submit a fresh application for a visa. Any such application should be accompanied by appropriate up to date supporting documentation which will address the concerns of the visa officer.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda <Col N="954"/>authorities that currently the area referred to by the Deputy is policed by garda&iacute; attached to the Dublin metropolitan region west division and the Dublin metropolitan region south division. The personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region west division as at 20 June 2005 was 679, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region south division as at 20 June 2005 was 563, all ranks.</P>
        <P>In addition, the divisional task force, divisional traffic units, district detective units, district patrol cars and mountain bicycle units from both divisions patrol the area. There are also currently two community garda&iacute;, one from each division, allocated to the area. Local Garda management is satisfied that there is no diminution of policing service and that as a result of being dealt with by the two Garda stations the area in question is being provided with an enhanced policing service.</P>
        <P>I understand that current policing plans for the area are predicated on the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of local residents. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that this strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of a policing service to the area in question.</P>

        <P>Where a person has been convicted in court, the court assessed all the evidence available to it before reaching a verdict. Decisions of a court can be appealed.</P>
        <P>Where people opted to pay a fixed charge, they accepted that they had committed an offence. The High Court decision does not imply that an offence was not committed. Payment of a fixed charge is an option offered to drivers and acceptance of the offer is not a finding of guilt. A determination of guilt can only be made by a court.</P>

	<P>All applications for asylum in the State are processed in accordance with the provisions of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, and in particular having due regard to the definition of a refugee in section 2 of that Act which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">A refugee is a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons <Col N="956"/>of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications and appeals for refugee status. These two offices are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, which considers applications for refugee status at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers appeals from negative recommendations of the commissioner.</P>
        <P>Decisions on asylum applications are made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform upon receipt of the recommendation or decision of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a person who has failed the asylum process and who has been refused refugee status in the State is informed in writing that it is proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him or her and he or she is given the following options: to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why he or she should not be deported; to voluntarily leave the State; or to consent to deportation.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of each case under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), a decision is taken whether to deport or to grant temporary leave to remain in the State. Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, requires the Minister to consider 11 factors, including representations received by or on behalf of the person, family and domestic circumstances, employment prospects etc., in deciding whether to make a deportation order or to grant temporary leave to remain in the State. Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement) requires the Minister to satisfy himself as to the safety of returning a person, taking into account protection issues other than those as specified above, before making a deportation order.</P>
        <P>The safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, <Col N="957"/>including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries.</P>

These include requiring all planning authorities to address the regulation and control of the location of licensed premises in their development plans; requiring applicants for retail licences, including off-sales licences, to present proof of planning permission and certification of compliance with planning conditions and fire safety standards to the District Court; extending the jurisdiction of the District Court to all retail licences and giving specified notice parties, including the health authority and members of the public, the right to object to the grant of a licence; streamlining the system for renewing licences and clarifying the right of members of the public to object to renewal in any particular case on stated grounds; strengthening provisions designed to combat sales to under-age persons by, for example, requiring all off-sales premises to have written policies and control procedures; supplementing existing offences relating to under-age consumption of alcohol with a new offence of being in possession of a forged Garda age card; and increasing the levels of penalties and sanctions, including a proposal that all temporary closure orders should involve closure for a minimum of two days.</P>
        <P>My proposals will also allow the Garda to object to applications for new retail licences on the grounds of an undue risk of public nuisance or a threat to public order or safety. In addition, the proposed Bill will contain provisions for dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises, as well as combating the sale and supply of alcohol to under-age persons.</P><Col N="958"/>
        <P>Finally, the current exemption under the planning and development code whereby an existing retail outlet may be converted into off-sales premises without any need to obtain specific planning permission for the development will be addressed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that no application for a Garda CCTV system has been received in respect of Carrick-on-Suir or Tipperary town by the CCTV advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems. It should be noted that 17 CCTV schemes, including Clonmel, are either at installation, tender or planning stages. The expansion is being implemented on a phased basis. Phase 1 involves Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick, phase 2 involves Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford and phase 3 involves Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. Phase 1 has been completed in 5 of the 6 locations.</P>
        <P>The installation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The Garda authorities have been giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme and to reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. The proposed redesign of the tender document provides an opportunity to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest possible extent, making use of the technical and project management expertise of the private sector. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achiev<Col N="959"/>ing implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>As a first step in this process, the Garda authorities have placed a request for tender document on the Government e-tenders website, seeking tenders for consultancy services for the procurement, supply and implementation of town centre CCTV systems to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Six tender proposals have been received and are being evaluated. In order to procure the most rapid delivery of the systems, the Garda is endeavouring to establish the most appropriate procurement model available. This process will involve the successful tenderer examining all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including the installation, operation and management of systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff in relation to the town scheme and Garda station premises and an assessment of the civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda.</P>
        <P>The successful tenderer must examine and recommend the procurement model that is considered to be the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost-effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. It is the ambition of the Garda to maximise the outsourcing of all processes in making Garda town centre CCTV systems available in the most efficient and effective manner. The inclusion of other town centre locations in the programme of Garda CCTV systems will be considered in the context of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

	<P>The visa application in question was for the purposes of allowing the wife of a non-EEA national employed in the State under the employment permit scheme to travel to the State to reside with him. When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer considers, among other factors, whether the level of salary of the worker comes within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In this regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment are used as a guideline. If the level of the worker&rsquo;s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for family income supplement payments, the application for a visa is generally refused, as in this case. Having reference to the relevant criteria, the applicant&rsquo;s husband did not demonstrate that he was in a position to support his wife fully without recourse <Col N="960"/>to public funds. The application was refused on 24 February 2005.</P>
        <P>An appeal was received in respect of the application on 4 May 2005, accompanied by additional documentation, including a P60 for 2003. However, a P60 was also submitted for 2004 covering just 18 weeks of employment. It was not clear why it did not cover the full year as the applicant&rsquo;s husband stated that he is in full-time employment. As the additional documentation did not fully address the concerns of the visa officer, the application was refused on appeal on 6 May 2005. As each application is entitled to just one appeal, no further action in respect of this application can be facilitated. It is still open to the person to submit a fresh application for a visa. Any such application should be accompanied by appropriate up-to-date supporting documentation that addresses the concerns of the visa officer.</P>

	<P>The powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau were strengthened by the enactment in March of this year of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005. The Act makes further provision in respect of the recovery and disposal of the proceeds of crime. It amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. It substantially bolsters the powers of bureau in the continuing battle to target the proceeds of all types of crime and extends those powers to the proceeds of white-collar crime and corruption. The Act&rsquo;s substantial provisions extend the proceeds of crime legislation to cover foreign criminality and corrupt enrichment. It also includes a number of technical provisions relating to court procedures, search powers and evidence. It extends the powers of the bureau to deal with foreign civil forfeiture recovery agencies such as the Assets Recovery Agency in the UK. The Act gives additional powers to the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners to seize cash suspected to represent, directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any criminal conduct &mdash; not just drug trafficking as previously &mdash; and to seize such cash anywhere in the State and not just in cases where it is being imported into or exported from the State.</P>

	<P>The Law Reform Commission recently published its final report on public inquiries, including tribunals of inquiry. The report contains almost 60 recommendations about tribunals of inquiry and a draft tribunals of inquiry Bill. The report is being examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a matter of urgency. I intend to bring proposals to the Government in the near future seeking approval for the preparation of a comprehensive Bill that will consolidate and reform current tribunals legislation. The proposed legislation will utilise the framework provided by the report of the Law Reform Commission and will, to the greatest extent possible, incorporate the report&rsquo;s recommendations. It will also include the reforms to give effect to the Government decision to try to reduce the legal costs payable by the State arising from tribunals.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Department of Finance, that the costs of the tribunals and inquiries which have commenced since 1995 amount to &euro;179.621 million, as at the end of April 2005. The cost of the tribunal on the beef processing industry, which commenced before 1995, was &euro;26.380 million. Much of the latter costs would have been paid during the period in question, but some element would have arisen before 1995.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 512 and 525 together.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that for an institution to be eligible to be considered for inclusion in the Schedule to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, it must have been subject to inspection or regulation by a public body. Some 128 institutions are listed on the original Schedule to the Act. In November 2004, I signed an order for a further 13 institutions to be added to the Schedule. As the religious ethos of an institution was not part of the criteria prescribed under section 4 of the Act, the Department of Education and Science did not require full details of the religious ethos of all the institutions listed. From records held in the Department, however, it seems that 19 institutions in the Schedule were non-Catholic facilities, of which one was multi-denominational, five had a Protestant ethos and 13 were run by the State.</P>

The introduction of the scheme will involve the provision of approximately 340 additional permanent posts in primary schools from September. A further 320 posts will be provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until they leave the primary school system. The general allocation for the school in question is 20 part-time hours. The Department of Education and Science has received a proposal from the school about the deployment of its allocation.

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year, as well as to a staffing schedule, which is outlined in Primary Circular 15/05 which was issued to all primary schools recently. This system <Col N="964"/>is in line with the guidelines agreed between the Department of Education and Science and the education partners.</P>
        <P>The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2000-01 school year consisted of a principal and 14 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 413 pupils on 30 September 1999, and one learning support post. Its staffing for the 2001-02 school year consisted of a principal and 14 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 371 pupils on 30 September 2000, and one learning support post and the services of a resource post based in the school. Its staffing for the 2002-03 school year consisted of a principal and 13 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 370 pupils on 30 September 2001, and one learning support post and the services of a resource post based in the school. Its staffing for the 2003-04 school year consisted of a principal and 13 mainstream class teachers, based on an enrolment of 356 pupils on 30 September 2002, and one learning support post and the services of a resource post based in the school.</P>
        <P>In the current school year, the staffing of the school consists of a principal and 12 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 328 pupils on 30 September 2003. It also has a learning support post and the services of a shared resource post based in the school. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will consist of a principal and 11 mainstream class teaching posts, based on an enrolment of 311 pupils on 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. If some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use a school&rsquo;s teaching resources to facilitate smaller numbers in other classes. School authorities should ensure there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes. The differential between the largest and smallest classes should be kept to a minimum. To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeals board is in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in the Department&rsquo;s Primary Circular 19/02.</P>
        <P>The board of management of the school in question has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board under developing school criteria. As the relevant application form outlined, the appeal will be considered by the appeals board at its meeting of October 2005. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter. I am sure the Deputy appreciates that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>

Educate Together strongly welcomed the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as <Col N="966"/>in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.</P>

	<P>The school in question is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the Giving Children an Even Break programme. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school benefits from an additional ex-quota teaching post, additional capitation grants of &euro;38.09 <i>per capita</i>, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects. Designated disadvantaged schools are included in the home school community liaison scheme and the school has access to the services of a shared home school community liaison co-ordinator. Under the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, the school benefits from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for pupils who are considered to be at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The level of funding provided under the scheme is commensurate with the number of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils in the school, which is not considered to be eligible for additional teaching staff under the scheme, based on the level of concentration of &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; pupils within its enrolment.</P><Col N="967"/>
        <P>A new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be given resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of the new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until they leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is two teaching posts and five part-time hours. The school may also be entitled to retain part-time hours under transitional arrangements to cater for the needs of individual pupils with high incidence special educational needs until they leave the school. I can confirm that the school&rsquo;s resource teaching allocation under the new scheme is based on its status as a girls&rsquo; school &mdash; the first post is allocated at 195:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are disadvantaged schools which are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. The school is ineligible for such additional staffing and does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality Of Opportunity In Schools, which I launched recently, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme that will bring together and build on a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting in the next school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key element of the new action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process, which is being conducted on behalf of the Department of Education and Science by the educational research centre, is under way. Questionnaires were issued to all mainstream primary schools and were due to be returned to the centre by 31 May 2005. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group that includes representation from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network. Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban and 300 rural primary schools and 150 post-primary schools will be included in the school support programme. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the <Col N="968"/>school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>

	<P>The school in question never had an allocation of one resource teacher for every 80 pupils as the Deputy suggests. It is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the Giving Children an Even Break programme. Under the disadvantaged areas scheme the school benefits from an additional ex-quota teaching post, additional capitation grants of &euro;38.09 <i>per capita</i>, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects.

	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary and secondary schools under two separate schemes. One is the 1978-79 scheme under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. These secretaries are paid directly through my Department&rsquo;s payroll. The 1978-79 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.</P>
        <P>The 1978-79 scheme has been superseded by a more extensive school support grant scheme towards the funding of ancillary services in schools including secretarial services. The scheme is flexible in nature giving boards of management and schools discretion as to the manner in which secretarial services are provided.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant programme provides grants to schools that are not directly linked to any pay scales. Therefore the level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 529 and 530 together.</P>
        <P>The practice of looking after the personal and social well-being of children under the care of a school, encompasses a wide variety of issues, including health, social and moral education, behaviour management and emotional support. My Department provides a range of supports which assist the pastoral care systems in place in individual schools.</P>
        <P>At primary level, the curriculum in general is designed with a view to enabling the child to live a full life as a child and to realise his or her potential as a unique individual; to develop as a social being through living and co-operating with others and so contribute to the good of society and to prepare for further education and lifelong learning. This is achieved through a broad range of subjects which develop different aspects of the child from social, personal and health education, religious education, physical education through to the academic aspects of the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Similarly within the second level curriculum, social, personal and health education, SPHE, provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills which can play an important role in encouraging a positive self-image. The key emphasis is on promoting <Col N="972"/>self-esteem and physical and mental/emotional well being, and responsible decision making. Self management, communications, physical and emotional health, coping with loss, handling conflict, substance abuse, personal safety, relationships and sexuality are covered. Implementation of SPHE in schools is assisted by a full time support service which operates on an integrated basis in collaboration between the Department of Education and Science and the health boards.</P>
        <P>Pastoral care teams in second level schools provide important assistance in promoting students&rsquo; well-being and in ensuring that potential difficulties can be identified early. Guidance counsellors, home school liaison co-ordinators, chaplains, class year tutors and the services of the national educational psychological service, NEPS, can play an important role in this respect. In recognition of the vital importance of guidance in our school system, I recently announced the allocation of 100 additional posts for guidance from the commencement of the 2005-06 school year. This extra guidance provision will enable students to develop skills that will lead to effective choices and decisions about their lives.</P>
        <P>The class teacher is also a significant catalyst in enabling schools to respond to educational and pastoral challenges. Teaching is an activity that contributes to the full development of the human person. My Department is committed to that development and to the delivery of an education that is relevant to individuals&rsquo; needs and which creates a socially inclusive society.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department has issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their teaching allocation under the new general allocation model for the 2005-06 school year. The letter also includes details of any clustering arrangements that may apply. The three schools in question have been arranged in different cluster arrangements under the new model.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that one of the objectives of the general allocation model is to maximise the extent of full-time permanent posts available to support the needs of pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs and learning support teacher requirements. Clustering facilitates the assignment of experienced teachers as well as allowing for better training of resource teachers on the basis that permanent posts will retain teachers for longer periods. This ultimately benefits the pupils.</P>
        <P>To this end, schools, particularly those with small enrolments, have been grouped in clusters where possible. In general, the permanent post <Col N="973"/>allocation clustering arrangements cannot be altered unless in exceptional circumstances such as geographical location.</P>
        <P>Part-time hours have been provided for schools in cases where it was not possible to form a cluster of general allocation hours. Schools that have been allocated part-time permanent hours may be aware of a local school(s) with part-time permanent hours that when combined could form a full-time permanent post. It is open to any such schools wishing to form a cluster by combining these hours to contact my Department&rsquo;s special education section in writing with details of their proposal. It should be noted that these arrangements apply to staffing associated with the general allocation model only.</P>
        <P>Where it is not possible for schools to form permanent posts under the general allocation model, such schools may, for the purposes of creating temporary full-time posts, form clusters to combine permanent part-time hours allocated under the general allocation model with hours allocated for individual children with low incidence disabilities, or transitional hours retained for children with high incidence disabilities. Again, any schools wishing to form such temporary full-time posts should contact my Department&rsquo;s special education section in writing with details of their proposal. This arrangement will apply for the 2005-06 school year only and is being facilitated on the understanding that, as pupils with an individual allocation of hours leave the school at the end of that school year, the full-time temporary posts will be adjusted to the appropriate reduced level of part-time hours.</P>
        <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that the schools in question have submitted a proposal regarding a revision of the clustering arrangements that had been notified to them. The proposal involves dissolving the cluster arrangements notified to them and creating a new permanent teaching post among the three schools. My officials are currently examining the proposal and will be in further contact with the school authorities as quickly as possible. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue at an early date. It is also intended that this circular will address issues that have been raised by schools with my Department since the system was notified to schools in mid-May.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs supports and decides on the level of support appropriate to the school.</P>
        <P>Seventy-one special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents. My officials have been in contact with the NCSE regarding the pupil in question. The NCSE has advised that the pupil was sanctioned the services of a shared special needs assistant, SNA. The decision was based on the relevant documentation submitted with the application. I understand that the school is of the opinion that the pupil should have the services of a full-time SNA.</P>
        <P>The NCSE will undertake to review the decision on the level of SNA support granted on foot of a request from the school or parents-guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision. The NCSE has outlined this process in its circular 01/05 which issued to all primary schools. It is, therefore, open to the school to submit further documentation to the SENO in support of the application for full-time SNA assistance.</P>

        <P>The school planning section of my Department has received the local inspector&rsquo;s report on the proposed amalgamation of the schools to which the Deputy refers. The next step is to carry out a technical inspection of schools and sites in question to establish which, if either, of the existing schools would be suitable as a host for the amal<Col N="975"/>gamation or if a new site is required. Officials in school planning section of my Department will be in contact with the school authorities when a date is confirmed for the technical assessment.</P>
        <P>The final decision on any amalgamation rests with the patron, subject only to my approval.</P>

	<P>While a number of full-time special needs assistants, SNAs, have availed of unpaid leave of absence, there is no formal career break scheme in place at present. SNAs are employed directly by the managerial authority of each school and currently, any decision to grant leave of absence without pay for a period of at least one year is a matter for the relevant school authority.</P>
        <P>My Department requires the managerial authority to have due regard for the exigencies of the school and possible negative effects in permitting such an absence. The welfare and educational needs of the pupil(s) must take precedence over all other considerations. Applications are currently sanctioned on the basis that the absence is of a minimum duration of one year commencing on the first day of the school year. Any application for an extension of the period of unpaid leave beyond one school year, is reviewed by the managerial authority on an annual basis. The combined periods of unpaid leave of absence granted to an SNA shall not exceed five years.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners. In the current school year the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy comprises of a principal and ten mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 273 pupils at 30 September, 2003. In addition, the school has two learning support posts and three resource teaching posts.  In accordance with the staffing schedule which issued recently to boards of management, the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will be a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 238 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system, an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 19/02 which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeals board met on 14 June and will meet again in July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>The closing dates for appeals for the forthcoming July and October meetings are 24 June and 7 October 2005, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The application form is available from primary payments section or on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is currently engaged in discussions with Educate Together in regard to annual funding. The provision of some additional <Col N="978"/>funding in 2005, to meet the immediate issues of concern to Educate Together, is under discussion along with their longer term needs. The current level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patrunachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.</P>
        <P>In regard to support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage. My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for state-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.</P>

	<P>Before the introduction of the Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle programmes, certain schools with disadvantaged status were awarded concessionary ex-quota teaching posts under the disadvantaged areas scheme. The posts were awarded on a permanent basis, and accordingly a number of schools continue to benefit from this additional teaching resource. The following schools in County Wicklow were granted ex-quota concessionary posts under the disadvantaged areas scheme: Sisters of Charity national school, Bray; St. Peter&rsquo;s national school, Bray; St. Joseph&rsquo;s national school, Rathnew; St. Ernan&rsquo;s boys&rsquo; national school, Rathnew; and Glenealy No. 1 national school, Glenealy. In addition, a full-time temporary concessionary post was sanctioned for Newcourt special school, Bray, in August 2002 to facilitate the integration of pupils with St. Andrew&rsquo;s NS, which is on the same campus, and other local primary schools. The post supports pupils who may wish to access a local mainstream setting to gain access to particular subjects for the State examinations and who also may wish to learn in an integrated setting alongside their peers.</P>

	<P>I have stated on a number of occasions that I believe that placing comments about teachers on the Internet is extremely unfair. Every student would complain if his or her teacher went on a website and put up his or her report or went to the local supermarket and stuck it on the notice board. No teacher would do that to a student and, therefore, it is not appropriate for a student to do it to a teacher. Not all the comments on the website are negative &mdash; a significant proportion of them are positive. Nonetheless, it is not appropriate for an individual in any profession to have his or her work commented upon on the Internet by anonymous commentators. The worldwide web is international and my Department has no means available to it to shut down this site.</P>

This school is heavily oversubscribed as a result of a significant number of pupils enrolling from outside its catchment area, including from the primary schools to which the Deputy refers. This development can impact negatively on those who are entitled, as of right, to a place in a particular school by virtue of the fact that they reside in the area and attend the appropriate feeder schools. It also invariably impacts negatively on the school or schools which these pupils should rightly attend and in which considerable capital investment has been made for this purpose. It is a matter for all school authorities, in the context of their enrolment policies, to limit enrolment to within their defined catchment areas to ensure that such situations do not arise.</P>
        <P>Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal <Col N="981"/>that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment of a student. An appeal will generally not be admitted unless it is made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent or student concerned. However, a longer period for making appeals may be allowed as an exception where it is accepted that circumstances did not permit the making of an appeal within the 42 day limit. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the school was previously in a clustering arrangement with four other schools. As a result of the allocation of additional resources to schools in the cluster, it was necessary to revise the clustering arrangements. The revised clustering arrangement means that the school will no longer be clustered with the previous base school. It is a matter for the board of management of the new base school to determine the teacher who will fill the general allocation post to service the revised cluster. The posts being provided under the new general allocation scheme are designed to ensure each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs such as hearing impaired will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</P>
        <P>With regard to which pupils in the school with high incidence special needs and learning support needs will receive support from the resource teacher, this decision will be made at school level. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs respond better with one-to-one tuition. <Col N="982"/>Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The response needed depends on the child.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have sanctioned the provision of an additional temporary classroom for the school to which he refers. The classroom will be in place for September 2005 to meet the anticipated demand for pupil places as identified by the school authority. Going forward, it is proposed to provide a new 16 classroom school to meet the long-term accommodation needs of the area. In this regard, the property management section of the Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been instructed to explore the possibility of acquiring a suitable site for this development.</P>

The Deputy will be aware that, where an immediate need arises for temporary accommodation to be provided to cater for an increase in enrolments straight away, the school can apply to my Department for temporary accommodation. Where a future need for permanent extra school places arises, the provision of extra permanent accommodation is considered under the new planning model for educational infrastructure which ensures, in future, school provision will be decided only after an open and transparent consultation process.</P>
        <P>The main feature of the new model, being introduced initially on a pilot basis, is the publication of area development plans, which will set out a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area into the future. Included in the pilot is the area around N4-M4, which incorporates the locality referred to by the Deputy. The publication consultation process on this plan was <Col N="983"/>recently completed and the Commission on School Accommodation hopes to be a position to publish its final plan shortly.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts will be provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>The posts being provided under the new general allocation scheme are designed to ensure each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs such as hearing impaired will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support.</P>
        <P>Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with support appropriate to their needs.

Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The response needed depends on the child. The school in question has been allocated one full-time post and 2.5 part-time hours under the general allocation system.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that EU Directive 2003/20 requires seat belts to be used where they are fitted. This directive must be transposed into national law by 9 May 2006. Separately, proposals to extend the requirement for seat belts to be fitted in all new vehicles, except for city buses used in stage stop routes, have been developed at EU level. When the directive is adopted, all new school buses being registered from a future date, yet to be determined, will require to be fitted with seat belts. It is not expected that this directive will provide for any mandatory retrofitting of seat belts in existing buses.</P>
        <P>The question of the fitting and the mandatory use of seat belts on school buses, outside of these legislative requirements, is at present under consideration in my Department.

        <P>Whatever conclusion is reached, the provision of seat belts on school buses, if that is what is <Col N="988"/>recommended, would have to introduced on a phased basis having regard to the logistical difficulties involved in sourcing right-hand drive buses equipped with any appropriate seat belts and the fact that not all the buses in the current fleet may be suitable for the retrofitting of seat belts.</P>

It would be premature to provide figures regarding the cost of replacing the fleet with seat belt fitted vehicles until the entire matter, including retrofitting of vehicles with seat belts, is examined and costed.</P>

	<P>The pension scheme for staff of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is at present being operated on an administrative basis pending approval a draft superannuation scheme for the board. The pension arrangements of the staff are in accordance with the model scheme of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>The model scheme, which is a standard public service scheme, needs to be updated to take <Col N="989"/>account of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001. It has not been possible to complete this work to date because discussions between union groups and management groups in the public service regarding the implementation of the Act have not been completed.</P>
        <P>Discussions are now at an advanced stage and it is expected that a circular giving full effect to the pensions provisions of the Part-time Work Act will be shortly issued by the Department of Finance. The formal approval of the Department of Finance will then be sought for the draft NEWB scheme, as updated to take account of the necessary provisions for part-time workers.</P>
        <P>Special provision will be made in the NEWB scheme &mdash; and such provision is regularly required when new schemes are being introduced &mdash; for the school attendance officers who have transferred, in accordance with section 40 of the Education (Welfare) Act, to the NEWB from employment by local authorities. The superannuation arrangements of the staff in question will not be less favourable than the arrangements which applied to them under the local government superannuation scheme.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the military authorities that on 15 September 1961, Trooper Patrick Mullins and Corporal Michael Nolan were killed in action in the Congo when their armoured vehicle was hit by anti-tank fire from armed elements. While the remains of Corporal Nolan were recovered, those of Trooper Mullins were not. An investigation into Trooper Mullins&rsquo;s death by the military authorities at the time concluded on 29 January 1962 that he was killed in action at Ave Du Cuivre, Lubumbashi, Elisabethville, Katanga, in the Republic of Congo as a result of the hostile action outlined. Trooper Mullins is classified by the military authorities as &ldquo;dead, presumed to have been killed&rdquo;.</P>

Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing. Some equipment was also missing. The attackers are unknown. Extensive diplomatic and military efforts to locate him have proved fruitless to date. Private Joyce is classified as &ldquo;missing in action presumed dead&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>The long-standing approach to motor taxation in Ireland involves determining the taxation category of a vehicle by reference to factors such as engine size, vehicle weight, type of vehicle and the purposes for which it is used. Motor tax for private cars is related to engine capacity and in this regard offers a degree of flexibility in the cost of tax. A seven seater vehicle with a lower engine capacity would, therefore, be liable for a lesser rate of motor tax than one with a higher engine capacity. It is not, therefore, proposed to review the basis of assessment for motor tax as proposed in the question.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 571, 575 and 576 together.</P>
        <P>The improvement and maintenance of non-national roads in its area is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Various documents have issued to road authorities relating to road works. These include my Department&rsquo;s guidance document, Surface Dressing, the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s Specification for Road Works and the Department of Transport&rsquo;s Traffic Signs Manual. My Department published Guidelines on the Depth of Overlay to be Used on Rural Non-National Roads in 1999. Since then, local authorities have been regularly reminded of the need to apply surface dressing to dense bitumen macadam overlays as soon as is practicable for skid resistance purposes.</P>
        <P>My Department has no function relating to national roads. Responsibility for national roads is a matter for the relevant road authority and the National Roads Authority, which operates under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Transport. Donegal County Council has advised my Department that the specific case referred to in <Col N="992"/>Questions Nos. 575 and 571 is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings and, accordingly, while all road fatalities are greatly to be regretted, it would not be appropriate to make specific comment at this stage.</P>

	<P>The 1990 regulations banning the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal were originally made to address the winter smog situation prevalent in the Dublin area at that time and have since been extended to 15 other areas taking account of the analysis of air quality monitoring data and also of population size. On foot of these criteria, the ban applies to two towns in County Wicklow, that is, Bray and Arklow, but not to Greystones.</P>
        <P>A June 2002 voluntary agreement between my Department and the Solid Fuel Trade Group provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the delivery of significantly cleaner standards for bituminous coal and pet<Col N="994"/>coke on a phased basis. Under this agreement, there is at present a temporary moratorium on the designation of further coal ban areas during the life of the agreement except where required to ensure adherence to air quality standards. The agreement also provided for an initial review by end 2003 and a final review by end 2004, with the ambition of setting further targets from 2005 onwards.</P>
        <P>My Department reviewed the operation of the voluntary agreement in 2003 but the final review due by the end of December 2004 was postponed following the granting of a moratorium on the step down to 2004 sulphur levels in petcoke for the 2004-05 heating season. The moratorium was requested by the trade group and was granted to help the industry through a difficult interim supply period, triggered by exceptional levels of demand for petcoke tonnages internationally which made the sourcing of lower sulphur fuels problematic for the industry.</P>
        <P>The agreement is now undergoing its final review and discussions are under way with a view to exploring further how to maximise environmental benefits from the solid fuel sector. It is not proposed to pre-empt the outcome of these discussions by extending the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal before completion of the final review.</P>
