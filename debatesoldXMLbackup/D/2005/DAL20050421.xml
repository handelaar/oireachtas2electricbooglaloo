    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for a national cervical cancer screening programme for all women in Ireland between the ages of 25 and 60, the 90% reduction of the risk of cervical cancer with regular screening, the steady annual increase of 1.5% per year in deaths in the Republic of Ireland from cervical cancer in every year from 1978 and the sharp decrease in cervical cancer rates since the 1960s and 1970s in every other country that introduced cervical screening programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to arrange for the appointment of a permanent consultant radiol<Col N="2"/>ogist to Mallow General Hospital and the provision of a CT scanner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement and be questioned on why he intends to permanently close Fort Mitchell Prison, Spike Island, given the large levels of public expenditure which in recent years have been spent on upgrading facilities at the prison to bring about the highest possible standards found in any Irish prison, higher than many still in operation, his undermining of the excellent education service that existed at the prison and his refusal to consider any scope for future development on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the pending industrial relations crisis in our prisons following the decision of the Irish Prison Officers Association to reject proposals for organisational change within the Prison Service and the response of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to that decision.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="3"/>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the wide-ranging recommendations contained in the second annual report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: the cutback in grant aid to many community cr&egrave;ches, resulting in an increased child care crisis, where the present high cost of cr&egrave;che places will be further exacerbated by the increased shortage of places, and the need to put in place a proper child-centred children&rsquo;s policy to restore the freedom for parents to play a greater role in child rearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 16, Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 <i>[Seanad] </i>&mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 17, Land Bill 2004 <i>[Seanad] </i>&mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 2, Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken not later than 1.30 p.m. and the order shall not resume thereafter. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the resumed Second Stage of No. 16 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, the conclusion of Second Stage of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 agreed to? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is four years since the Taoiseach announced that the needs of consumers would be a high priority for the Government. Today a leaked report from the consumer strategy group confirms that Irish consumers are being ripped off and that Government policy is hopelessly inadequate for dealing with this issue. Will we see continuing prevarication from Government, with report after report on issues of consumer protection piling up, or will we see action from the Government? Will the T&aacute;naiste accept the Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; legislation on a consumer enforcer, a key recommendation of the group, and implement it rather than delaying the House with lengthy redrafting? We should act on these issues instead of leaving consumers exposed to constant rip-offs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, tabled a question to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment asking when this report would be published and for details of it to be given to the House. The Minister replied that he expected the report to be published in the coming weeks. The details of that report are in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. That is a grave <Col N="4"/>disservice to the House and an insult to it. Repeatedly the Government makes announcements outside the Houses but it was brazen to tell a Member during Question Time that a report would be published in the coming weeks and then leak its contents to a national newspaper. It is something I am asking you, Sir, to voice a view on; otherwise, this House will be entirely irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of changing the rules of the House, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking your view, as Chairman of the House, on the notion that a Member could be told that in coming weeks the details will be published when the same Minister obviously briefed the newspapers on the contents of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the House, Deputy. It is not a matter for the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment intends publishing the report in conjunction with the Government&rsquo;s decision on some key recommendations in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the T&aacute;naiste read <i>The Irish Times</i> today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had two discussions at Cabinet, both this week and last week, on some of the key findings in that report and the Minister is to come back to the Government with a memorandum for decision shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be a series of findings where we will examine X, think about Y and set up another discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot have a debate on it. I call Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or consultation group on Z? Will decisions be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Every day brings some new revelations about the Gama Construction scandal and the fact that 1,400 workers were exempted from paying social insurance here &mdash; three quarters of all workers so exempted over the past three years. Will the T&aacute;naiste pledge that there will be a debate in the House as soon as the High Court matter is resolved? The T&aacute;naiste sat on this scandal for three or four years, having encouraged this company here in the first place and accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You have made your point, Deputy. Allow the T&aacute;naiste answer on the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a flimsy internal investigation in her own Department when it is clear that the official did not go outside the door to ask any of the workers concerned if the allegations were true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you cannot go on in this vein. You have made your point. The normal course in this House is to allow questions on debates that are promised. As the leader of a party I have allowed you ask the question on a debate. We cannot have the debate now. Please allow the T&aacute;naiste answer your question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with you, Sir. I am not asking for the debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>But you are having the debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to commit to a debate where we can fully probe her responsibility for the gross exploitation that took place, and now it turns out that the Irish Exchequer was being cheated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;both in tax and social insurance terms. They were not paying tax either, Sir. Did you know that, a Cheann Comhairle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot have this form of behaviour every Thursday morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They were not paying tax or PRSI and the T&aacute;naiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>You were allowed submit your question to the T&aacute;naiste. The T&aacute;naiste has been called to answer your question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;was responsible for invigilating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone signed the 1,400 exemptions for Gama Construction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, allow the T&aacute;naiste reply. The T&aacute;naiste has been called.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A Cheann Comhairle, I hope you will allow me to respond. First, Deputy Rabbitte should be aware that I had nothing to do with this company coming into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, you did.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="6"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Who signed the exemptions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry, Deputy Stagg. I had nothing to do with this company coming into Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course you did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Who brought them in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Ministers, and the responsible Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I always encourage investment here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless of who they are or what they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and, by and large, it has been extremely successful. Second, Deputy Stagg should be aware that SIPTU negotiated on behalf of these workers and assured the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that all was well. All of those workers were members of SIPTU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What investment is the T&aacute;naiste talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste keeps talking about investment. What investment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, please allow the T&aacute;naiste reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They were getting our contracts but they were not paying tax or social insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the T&aacute;naiste know they were not paying tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Third, I remind Deputy Rabbitte that there were many occasions when I was lobbied by Deputies, including Deputies in his party, to give work permits to certain companies here that were in breach of labour law and I refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In breach of labour law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and I refused to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a very serious allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact. There were some people running restaurants here who were not paying appropriate wages. There was lobbying to give them work permits&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste exempted them. They were not paying tax or insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and I refused to do so, notwithstanding the lobbying. I will not stand over any company treating its workers disgracefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste stood over it for three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Someone signed the 1,400 exemptions from tax and PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton, please allow the T&aacute;naiste conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That scheme applied to many companies, as the Deputy is aware, and not exclusively to this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 1,900&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I had nothing to do with that, by the way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is three quarters of everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the T&aacute;naiste to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 1,400 out of 1,900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not be lectured by a party that supported an amnesty for tax cheats. The Deputies should not lecture me about anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope we will have a debate on the Gama Construction report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation is urgently required to deal with the haemorrhaging from this country of the potential for renewable energy, given that the Airtricity company is pulling out of the Arklow wind-farm with the loss of a project worth between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million. The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is listed for this term. Will the T&aacute;naiste indicate whether the Government intends to seriously engage with that issue? Its policy on renewable energy is hostile. Will the Government put that wrong to right? When will that legislation be dealt with and will it deal honestly and rigorously with that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That legislation will be brought forward this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be any good?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Once again I have listened to the moral indignation of the T&aacute;naiste. She was the major shareholder in a company that has left many small family businesses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, have you a question appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="8"/>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with debts of &euro;20 million. Will she arrange to have them paid? She was the major shareholder of IFI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never been a shareholder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise, Deputy Timmins. I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste talks about Gama Construction but for more than two years she left many small family businesses without payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Timmins, allow your colleague to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should put moral indignation in its proper place. Her Government was the major shareholder &mdash; 51%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you are out of order. I call Deputy Durkan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government was the major shareholder but it has put many of these families out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Timmins, I ask you to resume your seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years later they have not received any payment. That puts Gama Construction in the ha&rsquo;penny place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation, in view of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s report, when will the electronic communications (miscellaneous provisions) Bill come before the House because there are pertinent matters that need to be dealt with? Arising from a matter on which I did not get clarity yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash; the broadcasting Bill &mdash; I am anxious that the Bill be brought before the House as a matter of urgency to allow us discuss the free promotion on the national broadcasting service&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for a Second Stage debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of a fundraising effort for a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate in the European elections.</P>

	<P>He is a good guy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill will be brought forward this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>Will he include the Minister of State in it as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>To provide for the establishment of health information and quality control, may I <Col N="9"/>ask the T&aacute;naiste when the health Bill will be introduced?</P>

	<P>This year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>On promised legislation with regard to the illegal charges, can the T&aacute;naiste clarify whether the grant of administration would have been carried out on probate? Can access be gained to the estate of a deceased person with a view to repayment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. I call Deputy Upton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a question on promised legislation. It is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is being examined. I understand the point the Deputy is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a grey area and I ask the T&aacute;naiste to seek clarification on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years ago I raised the issue of permit schemes and asked if legislation to deal with them was proposed. There is a new scam afoot now, which is the equivalent of a financial chain letter. In that regard, when will the gaming and lotteries Bill be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The Deputy has made a very valid point. There are also scams involving consumers, many of which appear in Sunday newspapers where one is invited to make a long call to be told whether one has the secret number to win a fortune, and the call costs much more than what one would win. There is a need for legislation but I am not sure the gaming and lotteries Bill will deal with that area. Perhaps we should examine it but it is not possible to say when that legislation will be forthcoming.</P>

I spent half a day being briefed by the Department when I went there and met Mr. Kelly every day that I was in Hawkins House. At no stage did anyone seek to tell me about the matter. While it is true that meetings were postponed, it was because I had to deal with legislation in the House, as is frequently the case.

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004:" RHead="Second Stage (Resumed)">
    <Title>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004 <?oasys _cf1-?>[<?oasys _cf2-?>Seanad<?oasys _cf1-?>]<?oasys _cf3-?>: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a few remarks on the Bill. As the House will know, serious questions have been posed of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently. These <Col N="14"/>have ranged from harsh criticism by Mr. Justice Morris of misbehaviour and mismanagement by certain garda&iacute; in Donegal to the failure to tackle the spread of drugs nationwide, declining crime prevention and detection rates and a rising clamour of public discontent about Garda professionalism and commitment.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who is representative of a generation which has great respect for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the many dedicated men and women in the force, especially the Garda Commissioner whom I hold in high regard. The time has long since come, however, for a root and branch review of the culture, role, structures and operations of the Garda. In the context of this need, the publication of the Bill, which broadly I support, represents a missed opportunity. I am also doubtful if Garda management has the training and skills to deploy professionally and efficiently Garda resources to best effect. The snail-like pace of the civilianisation programme is not a cause for confidence. I quote Mr. Denis Bradley, vice-chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, who said while giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights just a few days ago that he would not start from the point at which the Bill did if the aim were to go where he thought it should.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Mr. Bradley made a number of important points in his analysis of the Bill which are worth repeating due to his experience and expertise. He lamented the absence of a police authority between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the appointment of the Commissioner and senior Garda officers. He pointed out that the Conroy report, which dates back to 1968, made such a recommendation. He stressed the importance of establishing a political but independent group of people to act together to make senior appointments to maintain a distance between Government and the police. He referred in particular to our tendency to adopt &ldquo;a terrible centralism&rdquo; in which power is centralised, hierarchical and mostly male. No organisations in the world are more centralist, hierarchical and male than police services in which most decisions are taken at the top or in the centre and in which those in charge seldom devolve power if they can avoid doing so. According to Mr. Bradley, if power is not devolved within police structures and through civilian involvement and engagement as well as through oversight of policing, the police will remain centralist and very distant from the community.</P>
      <P>The need for a Garda authority and effective liaison at local level are connected issues. If provided, both would serve the imperative to move from a centrally directed service to one which is not only aware of and responsive to the needs of the community it serves but accountable to it. Community policing is not achievable unless there is community oversight.</P><Col N="15"/>
      <P>Two years ago the police in Northern Ireland drew up a document entitled Policing the Community in Northern Ireland. It emphasised that what is needed is a cultural change within policing itself. Such change should take into account, in the words of Ronnie Flanagan, that &ldquo;policing is too big to be left to the police themselves&rdquo;. If the community is not formally engaged with and does not have an ownership stake in policing, there is a danger of complete alienation between the police and the majority of citizens.</P>
      <P>Mr. Bradley&rsquo;s final point was to remark on the tendency to debate the respective merits of effective policing, judged by a police force&rsquo;s own performance indicators and other criteria, and the sort of policing the community wants. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Senior police officers will tell one that what the community wants is not effective policing. They will say, for example, that patrols on the street do not deliver effective policing. They will say that there are better and more professional ways of policing. The community, on the other hand, will say they want police officers walking the street and there is this supposed clash.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The reality is that these are not polar opposites. Both sides are right, but the police and the community are looking for two different things. The police officer wants effective policing and he is right in saying the man or woman on the beat does not provide this. The person who lives on the street, however, who wants garda&iacute; on the beat is also right because what he or she is talking about is the fear of crime. In other words, police can be very effective and professional in what they do but they must also meet the needs of people, much of it through new and effective community policing.</P>
      <P>Five years ago my colleague, Deputy Howlin, published the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals for a Garda authority and Garda ombudsman. At that time we said that dissatisfaction with the structures under which the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates exists and must be acknowledged. Dissatisfaction relates to the extent to which the force responds, is seen to respond and is capable of responding to legitimate community concerns. It includes widespread unhappiness with the working of the Garda complaints board and the adequacy of its governing legislation. It extends to the manner in which the force dealt with controversies such as <?oasys _dc20-?>the McBrearty, Carthy and Dean Lyons cases. This situation poses challenges to effective policing in Ireland. The challenge must be met head on.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>Confidence in effective, efficient and accountable policing is a critical component of any normal democratic society where the rule of law prevails. That is why, for example, the reforms of the police force in Northern Ireland proposed in the Patten report were so central to the peace process there. Of the Patten proposals only seven or eight were in any way controversial. The rest, and there were 175 in total, were regarded as sensible and <Col N="16"/>practicable. While we in the Republic of Ireland were keen to press upon politicians in Northern Ireland the importance of the Patten proposals, we have been slow to realise that if implemented, they will put policing in Northern Ireland on a much more modern footing than that of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>It is time we established an independent commission on policing in Ireland. It should be similar to the independent commission on policing which was set up under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999 to create, in the words of the Agreement, &ldquo;a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland with a police service capable of attracting and sustaining support from the community as a whole&rdquo; The terms of reference of the commission would require the identification and the setting up of new structures to ensure accountability, independent scrutiny and, above all, partnership with the community. Its methodology would involve a comprehensive consultative process. A wide-ranging public debate on policing in the 21st century should be initiated. The commission would take that debate to the highways and byways of the country. It would engage communities in local parish halls the length and breadth of Ireland. Equally, those professionally involved in policing practice and theory, including the Garda itself, would be consulted and best international practice would be ascertained.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The findings of the Patten commission constitute a valuable resource and reservoir of methodology and material that can be drawn from and adapted. The Patten commission was given 12 months to conduct its work. The new commission could complete its work in six to nine months. It is crucial that the process is comprehensive and inclusive. A lasting new police culture of service can only be delivered if a strong sense of participation, responsibility and ownership is engendered through the consultative process.</P>
      <P>It is the Labour Party view that there is need for a Garda authority to oversee the operation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at national level, to set objectives and priorities, adopt policing strategies and annual plans with the Garda Commissioner, conduct interviews and make promotional appraisals, negotiate the annual policing budget with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, monitor and evaluate Garda performance and produce an annual report for the Minister. The Garda authority would be answerable to and would appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights and the Committee of Public Accounts as required.</P>
      <P>The Government has rejected the proposal for a new Garda authority made up of individuals representative of the community as a whole. Such an authority would have introduced public accountability into the operations of the force. The lack of such an authority to act as a bulwark between the Commissioner and the Government means that there will continue to be an inappropriate degree of political interference in senior Garda appointments at every level above those <Col N="17"/>of Garda, sergeant and inspector. The failure to legislate for a Garda authority represents another missed opportunity. I thought this Minister might have taken that courageous step.</P>
      <P>The relationship between the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being placed on a formal if not an entirely open and transparent basis. The Commissioner will have direction and control of the force, will be Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and will have power to enter into contracts. He will be accountable to the Minister for his functions. The Minister may issue written directives &ldquo;concerning any matter relating to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rdquo;, but the directives must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 22 envisages that the contents of a directive might be kept secret and the fact that it had been made would be disclosed instead. That information of itself would be inadequate.</P>
      <P>It goes without saying that a police force which is constituted to serve the people should be accountable to the people. Therefore, the discredited in-house Garda complaints machinery should be dismantled immediately. In saying that, I do not reflect in any way on the excellent people who work for the board. An independent Garda ombudsman should be established to ensure that Garda behaviour in the course of duty is above reproach at all times.</P>
      <P>As the name suggests, the Bill provides for a compromise, a half-way house proposal. On the one hand, the three member commission is to be appointed on the nomination of both Houses and can only be removed by joint resolution of the Houses. Its independence is guaranteed. It will have power to conduct investigations on its own initiative and examine and report on Garda policies, practices and procedures, even if the conduct of individual members is not culpable. When investigating complaints that may involve offences, its officers&rsquo; powers will include, &ldquo;powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest&rdquo; of garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, while the ombudsman commission will have power to appoint its own staff and will inherit the staff of the former Garda complaints board, it will also have power to engage the temporary services of serving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Those members&rsquo; service as officers of the ombudsman commission will count as continuing service in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for purposes such as pension, seniority and promotion. These seconded officers will have power to act as investigating officers in regard to complaints against their past, and future, colleagues. That is a mistake. This enabling provision, set out in section 66, has the potential to undermine the real and perceived independence of the commission. It should be abandoned and removed from the Bill. I hope the Minister will agree to do that on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a valid complaint, the initial step of obtaining and preserving all relevant evidence is entrusted under section 81 to members of the Garda. This function should instead be vested in <Col N="18"/>the officers of the ombudsman commission. In the absence of a complaint, by or on behalf of a specific and identified individual who claims to have been directly affected by the conduct to be investigated, the commission has no power to investigate a matter if it suspects a garda may have committed a criminal offence or breached discipline.</P>
      <P>Chapter 4 of the Bill, dealing with co-operation between the force and local authorities and with arrangements for obtaining the views of the public, is welcome as a considerable strengthening of the Minister&rsquo;s original two short sentences in the general scheme. It goes a long way towards the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals for policing liaison committees, which were in turn drawn from the Patten report. Those important sectors of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which specifically relate to working with the people in a community context, namely, community policing and neighbourhood watch, remain the &ldquo;cinderellas&rdquo; of the Garda, decades after their establishment. They are under-resourced, understaffed and underpromoted. There is no career structure in community policing and, as Denis Bradley pointed out:</P>
      <P LI="1">Culturally, they are seen to be less effective as police officers. They lose part of their status because they are seen as the soft side of policing rather than the effective side.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is a tragedy that this mindset persists within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Department officials, dedicated and diligent as they are, appreciate the extent of the anti-social behaviour phenomenon that is ravaging so many of our communities. I appreciate that it is not as major an issue in the middle class areas in which those of us who inhabit this House and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, mainly, live. However, in large tracts of Ireland, not only urban Ireland, this is the single greatest issue affecting very many neighbourhoods and communities, where there is a virtual breakdown of the fabric of society. The amount of resources being put into community policing is entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>The strategic approach to community policing is inconsistent and, as Denis Bradley said, culturally the garda&iacute; are less effective as police officers. They lose part of their status because they are seen as the soft side of policing rather than the effective side, but nothing could be further from the truth. Where the community policing experiment works and is deployed to effect by the Garda authorities, it is a tremendous success. Local communities are deeply indebted to the small number of community garda&iacute;, men and women, in their areas and they have the highest respect and value for the work they do.</P>
      <P>However, there does not seem to be an appreciation of the extent to which these communities are under siege. I have raised on a number of occasions in the House the plight of old people, men and women living alone, people who are different and immigrants targeted for <Col N="19"/>persecution and harassment by young thugs out of control. This reflects the breakdown of parental responsibility. In some cases the parents are more dysfunctional than those who are marauding, joyriding and terrorising local communities, and it is not being dealt with. The areas are not being policed. The community allocation is inadequate.</P>
      <P>In the early stages of this Bill&rsquo;s preparation I raised with the Minister the desirability of police liaison committees at local authority level. He has acknowledged that and I thank him for enshrining it in the legislation. It needs, perhaps, to be adapted to the metropolitan area to have regard for complexity of policing, population densities and so on, but it is a good initiative. I have no doubt, however, that unless the police liaison committees are established and required to answer in front of the media in county council chambers, where the work is monitored and assessed over a period, this issue of anti-social behaviour will come back again and again. The Minister and his Departmental should tackle it now and the deployment of resources for community policing ought to be addressed.</P>
      <P>It is the Labour Party view that community policing requires new structures to be anchored at local level to be effective. These structures must reflect a partnership between the police and the community. Local government administered by local authority officials and local public representatives is the obvious choice of location for new partnership structures. Local government requires co-operation at a far more immediate level than one single policing committee to deal with, Fingal County Council, for example, which covers an area of approximately 173 square miles and has a population of almost 170,000.</P>
      <P>Section 32 allows for a joint policing committee in respect of each of the 29 counties, five cities and 80 towns. However, major metropolitan suburbs are ignored and this should be looked at again. A strategic policy committee based on the county council or county borough would bring together the local public representatives, local authority officials, senior garda&iacute;, representatives of State agencies and community and business interests. Together and in consultation with the new Garda authority they would prepare a county or city policing plan. Second, a smaller area committee would prepare an area policing plan. This policing plan would be agreed by local public representatives, the senior officer from each Garda station, community and business interests and local authority officials for the area. It would be approved by the Garda authority.</P>
      <P>The community policing forum would be the basic unit of interface between the public and the Garda. It could operate within a geographical remit of one Garda station or more, or a local electoral area or part thereof. Local needs would determine time and place. It would be a forum for public representatives, local Garda officers, resident associations, community groups, <Col N="20"/>members of the public and local authority officials to assemble in committee or in open forum as circumstances warrant. Residents could articulate their concerns, observations and experiences of crime in their communities. Crimes against the person, alcohol and drug abuse, crimes against property, vandalism and anti-social behaviour would be discussed and noted. Factors giving rise to these criminal activities and strategies to tackle them would be identified. Allocation of policing work would be agreed within the forum. In some instances the local authority would be asked to take action through such means as improved lighting, extinguishment of rights of way over laneways and warnings or eviction of tenants.</P>
      <P>An independent co-ordinator would liaise with the Garda, the local authority and the community and business groups to ensure that agreed policing and other delegated work was carried out and that the various groups and individuals were kept informed of progress on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the Bill is to repeal all the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts, other than those dealing with Garda compensation and the acquisition of premises. The Bill provides that the existing force will continue in being and, for the first time, sets out its statutory functions. It provides, however, that nothing in the Bill affects the common law powers, immunities, privileges and duties of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This naturally raises the question as to what exactly is the status of an individual member of the force at common law.</P>
      <P>Is a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a constable, enjoying common law powers and immunities? The word &ldquo;constable&rdquo; has never been used in any of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Acts. If the member has common law powers, is he or she subject to control in their exercise? Is the Commissioner, the Minister or the State liable for their wrongful exercise? Indeed, when statutory powers are conferred on a member of the force, are they exercisable by him or her at personal discretion, as an individual garda, or is the member subject to the direction and control of superior officers, as a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na? If a superior directs a member to arrest someone and he or she does not personally have any grounds for suspecting that the individual is guilty of an offence, is the arrest lawful? This is a fundamentally important question. The answer is uncertain and is at present the subject of a Supreme Court appeal. It is regrettable the Minister did not take the opportunity to provide clarification.</P>
      <P>Section 41 provides that the State is civilly liable for the actionable wrongs committed by individual garda&iacute; &ldquo;in the course of performing the member&rsquo;s functions under this Act&rdquo;. This is odd, not least because the Bill does not set out any functions of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as opposed to functions of the force, for which the State could become liable. The section firmly places the State&rsquo;s liability for the wrongs of a <Col N="21"/>garda within the context of an employer-employee relationship, in so far as statutory functions are concerned. However, it remains unanswered as to who, if anyone, is liable for wrongful acts committed by a garda in the performance of non-statutory or common law functions.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind the proposal in section 14 to admit unpaid but trained volunteers to the rank of garda in the force, to assist it in exercising its functions is not explained. It requires further elaboration and justification. The section does not even state that volunteer garda&iacute; are to be unpaid, part-time, or both. It is worth noting in this context that few garda&iacute; live in working class areas of Dublin. Garda&iacute; do not live in those areas or go to mass, the pub or the bookmakers in those areas. They do not do the normal everyday things others in those areas do. The question then arises for community policing, as to the extent one can draw people from within a community to assist in policing their own community. The Government has no proposals in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>In County Mayo, people are becoming more aware of the reduction in Garda numbers based in small rural stations. From speaking to people locally, I note garda&iacute; are being drafted from the smaller rural stations into the larger urban centres in County Mayo. This does not go down well with the people of Mayo. As taxpayers, we deserve and have the right to the resources necessary to ensure the proper provision of a police service. I pay tribute to the garda&iacute; in County Mayo who do a splendid job under trying circumstances. Demands are increasing on the Garda due to the growing problems in the larger urban centres. However, there is a case for supporting policing in rural areas. It goes back to the debate on balanced regional envelopment and stemming the drift of people away from rural areas into large urban centres. The onus is on the Minister to support rural policing.</P>
      <P>Some 26 years ago, when I first moved to Mulranny, the local garda lived in the village, ensuring a Garda presence day and night there. This has been replaced with the &ldquo;man-in-the-door&rdquo;, an intercom system, linked to a Garda station in Westport which one must use to make a complaint. Very often garda&iacute; are not available and, from making inquiries on the matter, it is obvious the force is not there on the ground. We can never underestimate the value of having a garda on the street, where he or she has the opportunity to meet the community, be seen as part of its everyday life and as being available for whatever situation arises. The garda on the street can predict situations before they arise and play a preventative role that may avoid individuals receiving criminal records. The garda on the street will know the young people in the community, allowing him or her to have a quiet word with parents, publicans or other parties to prevent misdemeanours. This is a valuable asset to any community, particularly in a rural area. It is a slippery <Col N="22"/>slope when garda&iacute; are taken away from rural areas because there is less crime there than in urban areas. In time rural areas will be left without a proper Garda presence, resulting in an increase in crime levels for which society will be the loser. There is a great onus on the Minister to ensure resources are provided for rural areas.</P>
      <P>Considering the shortage of garda&iacute; on the beat, I tabled a parliamentary question on the number of garda&iacute; deployed on desk and other administrative duties. I asked if, due to the nature of this work, a major part of it could be done by non-Garda personnel to allow more garda&iacute; to be at the coal face. The Minister replied that the Garda authorities, responsible for the detailed allocation of resources including personnel, stated 373 garda&iacute; were employed in administrative posts. These 373 garda&iacute; should be on the beat. The Minister could not give me a breakdown of the age profile of these garda&iacute; as it would take up many resources. I argue this would be a good use of resources. If more garda&iacute; could be on the beat rather than pen-pushing, communities would be all the richer. Deputy Gregory, speaking on his experience in inner city Dublin, also pointed to the lack of garda&iacute; on the beat. The Minister must address this issue.</P>
      <P>I accept the Government approved the civilianisation of administrative posts in the Garda on a phased basis. It includes administrative posts at headquarters, branches in the various offices, locations, divisions and districts and the transfer of finance functions from Garda district clerks to civilians and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer. However, there is a need for the Minister to follow up his proposal to increase the strength of the Garda force to 14,000 members. While he claims this will happen on a phased basis, the problems on the ground continue, becoming greater every day.</P>
      <P>It is important that people see the Garda as a force to which they can relate and part of community life. Its members should be seen to be individuals with whom people can have a quiet word rather than someone who is just there in emergencies. This gives the wrong impression. Young people will get up to all sorts of devilment, as we all did in our time. However, if there is someone to guide us on the right road, we have much better chance of coming out better. People speak of the social aspects of crime and the effects of living in an area with high crime levels. If the supports are not available for communities, whether it be community centres, youth workers or the friendly garda on the beat, young people have less of a chance. Getting the Garda to be part of the community is essential.</P>
      <P>The Army and garda&iacute; provide security for the transport of cash by security companies on behalf of the banks. The banks appear to be unable to police this themselves. Previously, I asked the Minister if this should be 100% funded by the banks. That appears to be happening now and I welcome it.</P><Col N="23"/>
      <P>Given the availability of modern technology, particularly GPS to track vehicles, the recent robbery of the security vehicle should not have occurred. A simple GPS tracking device would have ensured the people driving the vehicle would not have stopped for coffee because it would have been known at the base and they would not get away with it. There has been sloppiness in the system for a long time but for as long as the Government is paying a large part of the bill it will continue. There are also money marking devices available, such as explosive pellets which will explode if a security box is opened.</P>
      <P>The practice of the Garda and the Army supporting the security of the banking institutions should be self-financing and the Minister must ensure this. There are problems in the community and it is unacceptable that resources are used in this manner. When resources are finite or scarce, those that are available should be used effectively. Garda&iacute; pushing pens at a desk or supporting the security of rich banks, which should provide their own security, is a waste of resources and must be changed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. A measure that consolidates and modernises legislation is welcome. Legislation in this area dates back to 1924. The objective of the Bill is to support the efficient and effective operation and administration of a modern police force. It is important the Garda is supported. The Bill will ensure a good relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government and the Oireachtas, which is welcome. It also provides for appropriate independent inspection and complaints investigation mechanisms which will command and maintain the confidence and respect of the public and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is most important.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provides a good service. Garda&iacute; are regularly on the front line without the resources to do their job adequately. What is the rate of &ldquo;blue &rsquo;flu&rdquo; or sick leave among garda&iacute;? It must be quite high in areas where resources are scarce and where garda&iacute; are under great pressure, are assaulted and are going on duty in fear for their lives. This is a major problem. If resources are being denied to the force and it leads to a greater incidence of sick leave absence and people leaving the force prematurely, it is a waste of resources equal to that of having garda&iacute; on pen pushing duties or engaged in guarding the banks, which can well afford to do it themselves.</P>
      <P>We must support the garda&iacute; in doing their job. Garda&iacute; were demoralised by the situation in Donegal. The report of the Morris inquiry made for forceful reading and exposed a new dimension of the situation. The need for an independent complaints procedure, whereby garda&iacute; are not judging garda&iacute; is a fundamental requirement. I welcome its introduction in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There would be greater respect for the law and law enforcement if the system was seen to be fair. The Minister should consider instituting a twilight zone, as it were, whereby somebody who is one <Col N="24"/>or two kilometres above the speed limit would not get the same penalty points as somebody who is greatly above the limit. In such situations a driver might be trying to stay within the limit but errs by being slightly over it. A twilight zone would bring fairness to the system.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem with parking meters. When the concept of maintaining clearways is seen as a money making venture rather than as a means of promoting traffic flow, it gives people a different perspective. There should be a sense of fairness. When laws are not working or are not being enforced, people will take advantage of that.</P>
      <P>With regard to the problem of people driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, if parents can test their children for drugs there is no reason that such a facility should not be available to garda&iacute;. Young people now feel they can drive with abandon under the influence of cannabis or some other drug aside from alcohol because they believe they will escape detection. The Minister should address this issue.</P>
      <P>The concept of community policing and involving garda&iacute; in the community is extremely important and I welcome any move to implement it. Involving elected representatives in policing is also important. I welcome the fact that there will be meetings between local garda&iacute; and public or community representatives at local level.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with alcohol and off-licences. People are adopting continental habits whereby they are more inclined to drink at home. Off-licences are thriving but pubs, as a result of hidden charges such as insurance costs and the like, are finding it hard to make ends meet. On previous occasions I have suggested the use of a barcode whereby the supplier of a product could be traced. If somebody purchases alcohol for a young person, it could be traced back to him and he would have to account for supplying it. Youngsters getting alcohol, even directly, from off-licences is a serious problem but the alcohol could be traced by using a barcode. I understand there is provision for such a system in the legislation but it is not being enforced. It should be enforced.</P>
      <P>The Government wrings its hands and speaks about what can be done to stop the abuse of alcohol. One action that could be taken is a ban on advertising alcohol but the Government has taken a soft approach on this, which is probably for revenue reasons.</P>
      <P>The problem of road deaths must be confronted. Many of them are caused by speeding. If there was an element of fairness in the law, people would be more compliant with it. The problem of people driving under the influence of alcohol and other drugs must be examined. The incidence of people driving under the influence of drugs other than alcohol is underestimated. The Minister should consider conducting an audit to determine the actual number of such incidents, particularly among young people.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for many useful changes. We must ensure there is a proper standard of <Col N="25"/>policing. This will only be done through the use of adequate resources, which has always been the problem. The Government acts in a reactive fashion. When there was a spate of robberies of older people, steps were taken such as placing a Garda checkpoint on the Shannon, which did not make a big difference. Once the crisis is over, the resources just seem to disappear. It is important that we support the Garda by providing the adequate resources they need. There is great pressure on garda&iacute; to have a certain number of prosecutions, which cannot be right. This should not be about prosecutions, but about people abiding by the law in their own interest. The laws are made in the Oireachtas and garda&iacute; enforce them. The idea should not be to catch people out, but to uphold the law.</P>
      <P>Whether people live in urban or rural areas, they deserve a certain minimum standard of policing. For that to happen, adequate resources need to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to place on record my appreciation of the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire. In 20 years of public life as a Deputy and a councillor, I have worked with a succession of chief superintendents, superintendents, Garda officers and garda&iacute;. I have always valued their work. I understand the difficulties within which they must work and I have always appreciated their co-operation and efforts to provide a police service in the area. I cannot say that I have always been happy with the outcome of every issue raised, that every problem was resolved, or that every complaint was addressed adequately. However, the garda&iacute; have an increasingly difficult role to perform in our changing society. They deserve the support of the public and of public representatives in carrying out that work and in turn, the public is entitled to high quality public service policing from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to debate policing and the related issues of crime, anti-social behaviour and what is happening in society. I welcome the fact the Bill acknowledges some of the proposals for reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that were made by the Labour Party a few years ago. These proposals were published in a document by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, when he was the Labour Party spokesperson on justice. To be fair to the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform, he did acknowledge those proposals when he introduced the Bill in the House. However, I am disappointed the Bill does not go as far in reform as the Labour Party had proposed. I ask the Minister to take seriously the recommendations and suggestions which were being made to improve this Bill and which were articulated this morning by the leader of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>This Bill is before the House at a time when there is a growing problem, to which we must face up, concerning crime, public order, personal safety and anti-social behaviour, which is occur<Col N="26"/>ring right across our society. It has been most acutely manifested in urban areas where there are high levels of disadvantage. However, it is by no means a problem exclusive to areas of disadvantage or to urban areas.</P>
      <P>The economic crisis was the big problem that had to be addressed 20 years ago. If someone was asked 20 years ago what had to be addressed by way of public policy, he or she would have said we needed to get people to work, halt emigration and get the economy going so we could resolve many of the social problems. Thankfully, we have largely resolved that economic question and we now have a thriving economy and long may that continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no thanks to the Minister of State. It is thanks to the people who get up every morning, go out to work and generate the resources that keep this country going. Frankly, I am sick and tired of Ministers clapping themselves on the back for the work which the ordinary people of this country are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I was only trying to be civil. It is just a pure coincidence that we have been there for 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State needs to examine his conscience over why it is that when the resources are being generated, his Government cannot get the health and education services right and cannot guarantee that ordinary people will be safe in their own neighbourhoods. The biggest problem is no longer centred on the economy but on society. We can analyse why that is so. It seems that, with our increasing wealth, we have generated a society where everything is about the self. There is a new culture of the individual and of individuals being mediated between each other by the market. There is less of an emphasis on issues like neighbourhood, community, society and even good behaviour. The result is that we have seen a disintegration of society in many parts of this country.</P>
      <P>As Deputies, sometimes we have an obligation to reflect the reality of what is happening in our constituencies. This week, I spoke to the chairman of a residents&rsquo; association who told me of an incident that happened on his estate recently. A man walking to the pub on a Friday evening was attacked and had his arm broken. I met a mother who told me of an assault on her son two years ago, when a rock was thrown at his head. He was in hospital for several weeks suffering from possible brain damage, yet his case has not yet appeared in court. I spoke to another mother whose 15 year old daughter had her hair set on fire with a cigarette lighter as she was travelling home from school on the bus. I spoke to a parent who told me she could not let her seven and eight year old children out to play on their own street because of the bullying, intimidation and physical <Col N="27"/>abuse they were receiving. I spoke to another constituent whose car was damaged maliciously in his own driveway.</P>
      <P>There seems to be an attitude in the Government that there is an acceptable level of criminal activity and that this will always be with us. It does not always have to be with us. We all agree that we adhere to the concept of freedom. Freedom is about more than the absence of a political oppressor. It is about more than economic exploitation. Freedom is the right of an individual to go about his or her business without being molested or attacked. It is about the right of a young male to be able to go out on a Friday night without fear of being attacked on his way home. It is about the right of a child to travel on public transport, be it from school or from some recreational activity, without being attacked. It is about the right of a woman to walk at any time of the day or night in her city, her streets or her neighbourhood without fear of molestation. That sort of freedom is being denied to too many citizens and it is not being vindicated by the actions of the Government.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the problem arises when people seek Garda assistance in such cases. I do not want my contribution to be regarded as having a go at the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because it is not. I have already put on record my appreciation of the work of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. When an incident arises, however, and I ask constituents if they reported it to the garda&iacute;, they often say they did not do so. This is because they were afraid to report an incident due to recriminations that might occur as a result. Typically, I am told the person does not want to report it because he or she does not want a stone through the window. Alternatively, I may be told it was not reported because nothing was done when previous incidents were reported, and that there is no point reporting it. When somebody does report an incident to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na I am often told that it took the garda&iacute; too long to get to the scene of the incident to deal with it.</P>
      <P>That raises the issue of Garda numbers and the way in which they are deployed. Three years ago, the Government promised the country it would provide 2,000 additional garda&iacute;, but they have not yet been provided. In many parts of the country the Garda presence is inadequate. I agree with Deputy Cowley that the closure of rural Garda stations should not be happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not happening. If the Deputy is citing facts, he should acknowledge that the new garda&iacute; are already in the training college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in the Government saying it wants to develop rural areas and build up the population, which I agree with, while at the same time closing post offices, Garda stations and other services that are required in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="28"/>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no Garda stations being closed and the Deputy knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There are very few garda&iacute; in villages around the country where there used to be a Garda presence. The Minister should ask anyone how long it takes a Garda to get from the Garda station to the scene of an incident. There is a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>To correct the Deputy, Garda stations are not being closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be better if the Minister listened to what the problems are, rather than trying to defend the indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am just correcting a few issues that the Deputy has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a problem of garda&iacute; getting to the scene of an incident on time. When I ask people what happens when they report something to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, they often say the garda&iacute; came and took detailed notes but left the impression that nothing could be done. They say there is no point in going after the people because the evidence is too hard to get and even if they get the evidence and go to court, they will be let off with a caution under the Probation Act. That kind of message is very demoralising for somebody who has been assaulted, whose car has been damaged or whose home has been broken into.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that nothing can be done or that there is no point in doing anything in such cases. Many of the problems that are arising in communities could be dealt with under the Public Order Act that was passed by the House a few years ago but, frankly, I do not think the legislation is being enforced. Last summer, I was impressed when President Bush was here. One could not turn a corner in this city without coming across a Garda presence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We had an entire phalanx of garda&iacute; with water cannon on the Navan Road to police a few hundred youngsters on a protest. It leaves one wondering where the Garda presence is, when young people on a night out are subjected to physical assault and verbal abuse on the streets of our cities. This brings the whole idea of public service policing into disrepute. People become so frustrated that such issues are not being dealt with by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they asking armed criminals, who masquerade as political activists, to do it. That is happening and it cannot be ignored.</P>
      <P>While it remains broadly unacknowledged, there is a safety issue concerning members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Unfortunately, many of the types of circumstances which garda&iacute; have to investigate &mdash; sometimes in small numbers &mdash; are threatening. A greater emphasis needs to be placed on ensuring the safety of garda&iacute; when they <Col N="29"/>are dealing with such circumstances. Why, for example, did the Government even entertain the notion that the perpetrators who shot and killed garda&iacute; in the course of their work should benefit from provisions for early release from prison? Apart altogether from the political implications, it was wrong in terms of the message it sent out about the responsibility of the State and the Government to protect garda&iacute; by ensuring their safety when policing the streets.</P>
      <P>These issues are interlinked and are not capable of being dealt with solely by a policing response. That is why I strongly support the idea of local policing committees that would bring together the various agencies that work with troublesome elements in society. It is necessary to adopt such a new approach to the way in which our society is protected and policed. In doing so, we must acknowledge that there are difficulties in areas other than policing. For example, there is a difficulty concerning school discipline, which has been compounded since the Education Welfare Act was enacted. Currently, it is difficult for the authorities to apply sanctions for indiscipline at school. That is why the school authorities, along with other agencies, need to be involved in the proposed policing committees.</P>
      <P>Local authority estate management legislation needs to be examined also. Local authorities can apply sanctions where an offence is committed within a housing estate by a local authority tenant but they can do nothing where the offensive behaviour is perpetrated by somebody who is not a local authority tenant or where the activity occurs outside the housing estate. The offender may, for example, be a tenant purchaser or be living in private housing. Consequently, the legislation needs to be re-examined in that context.</P>
      <P>The health services also need to be examined in this regard and, in particular, the way in which we are dealing with the problems of psychiatric illness. This area needs to be faced up to because there have been cases where serious crimes have been perpetrated by people who, it has subsequently been discovered, were under some form of psychiatric care. We need to look afresh at the way in which such care is being provided, with a view to ensuring the priority is to protect public safety at all times.</P>
      <P>There is also a problem concerning substance abuse and I agree with Deputy Cowley that the advertising of alcohol should be banned. Over the years, we have had to take dramatic steps concerning different types of activity and behaviour and this is one that needs to be examined as well. When the Minister stops clapping himself on the back for all the good the Government is doing, I urge him to look at the Labour party proposals regarding police liaison committees. The form in which their establishment is proposed in the legislation mirrors local government structures that are no longer appropriate to 21st century Ireland and which remain unreformed. That is another day&rsquo;s work, the need for which is highlighted in the area under discussion. By all means let us <Col N="30"/>have a policing committee in a town of 10,000 or 15,000 people. However, the idea that one would not have a policing committee in a large conurbation of perhaps 50,000 people, in some Dublin suburbs for example, simply because they are parts of larger local authorities, needs to be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>My final point involves a constituency-related issue, namely the way in which Garda divisions and districts are organised. They need to be reconsidered with a view to how areas are developing. In my constituency we have three Garda superintendents, one each in Blackrock, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Bray. The latter Garda district covers about half of east Wicklow while another part of the county is covered from the southern end, from Arklow, and the remaining part from Naas, I understand. A great deal of development is currently taking place in south Dublin and north Wicklow, and the manner in which those Garda district boundaries have been defined needs to be looked at. In my constituency, one part of Ballybrack has its policing service provided from Cabinteely Garda station, which is answerable to D&uacute;n Laoghaire, while the policing service for the remainder of Ballybrack is provided from Shankill Garda station, which answers to Bray.</P>
      <P>I know boundaries of divisions and districts must always be set somewhere, but they currently cause operational difficulties. They need to be looked at in consultation with the Garda authorities so they reflect the coherence of areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important Bill, which along with my colleagues in the Green party, I welcome. As my colleague Deputy Cuffe, our party spokesman on justice, said, confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be restored. Public perception of the Garda is not as positive as it could be. At local level, while there are gripes about the Garda, people do not have a great many complaints about individual members of the force. I count among my personal friends many Garda members and I acknowledge the great work the force has done in upholding law and order since its inception, as well as the positive contribution it has made. That cannot be underestimated, but we must consider why confidence has dwindled and how it can be restored. I note that the clergy, journalists and politicians are held in lower esteem than garda&iacute;, so we must keep matters in context.</P>
      <P>We have heard the revelations from the Morris tribunal. Earlier today, Deputy Rabbitte also outlined the case involving Dean Lyons. Throughout the State, there are many examples of Garda impropriety, real or alleged, and of Garda incompetence or lack of training. I will give some examples, though on the whole the force does a very good job. At an anti-war protest outside Leinster House a few years ago I saw a sergeant kicking some protestors on the ground. I also saw <Col N="31"/>one of the protestors kicking the sergeant, so it is important to keep matters in context. Two days later, a close relative of mine who was protesting peacefully with a pot and a pan, was kicked in the face by a garda. I do not know if that was intentional, but these incidents must be mentioned.</P>
      <P>Another relative told me of a case involving a friend who is a taxi driver. I say this with some degree of caution as one can never be quite sure if a secondhand story is an urban legend. Allegedly, a taxi driver dropped a customer at his home in a north Kildare suburb. The customer ran off without paying his fare and the taxi driver gave chase. A local garda told the taxi driver he was a garda and told him to let the customer go. The taxi driver continued to give chase. The garda then intervened and got the fare from the customer. It turned out the customer was a brother of the garda. The incident was reported to the local Garda station and an investigation was promised. A couple of nights later, the garda involved arrived at the taxi driver&rsquo;s home to say he was investigating the case, even though his Garda station had nothing to do with the area where the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>These are everyday examples of members of the Garda not doing their jobs to the highest standard and not living up to the oath they have taken. However, they are isolated cases. Not so isolated, and increasing, are incidences of institutional racism.</P>
      <P>The debate on this Bill is a broad one and I want to contribute as broadly as possible. In publishing the Bill, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has played it pretty safe. We need real reform of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While there are moves to establish the Garda ombudsman commission, other issues need to be considered in more detail than given in the Bill. They include Garda training, recruitment, accountability, paper work, IT and most importantly, Garda numbers and resources.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of whether the Bill proposes any real change in the existing system of political appointments of senior Garda officers. No additional independence or new system of transparency is mentioned. Several sections of the Bill are of concern to my party. Some sections give very broad powers to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which I would prefer this Minister would not have. Section 23(2)(<i>c</i>), for example, directs the Garda Commissioner to have regard to any relevant policies of the Minister or the Government. I hope the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains an independent police service in order to retain the relatively high levels of public confidence it has, and to fight against the fall-off in that confidence. There is a need for an independent, credible police service. The Bill must allow for full accountability and genuine independence.</P>
      <P>Section 7(4) states that in performing its functions, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na shall have regard to <Col N="32"/>the importance of upholding human rights. My colleague Deputy Cuffe suggested we should add to that: &ldquo;and ensure fair and equal treatment and respect for all&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will comment later on the Garda training issue, particularly with regard to recruits in Templemore, but will first consider some of the discretionary powers alluded to earlier. I mentioned the reference to human rights, as noted in the Bill on page 11, section 7(4), line 36. The objective of the Garda is to prevent crime and preserve peace and public order. While the section covers the area of upholding human rights it needs to be further expanded to exclude discrimination. Discrimination in this sense means, for example, discrimination against ethnic minorities or religious groupings.</P>
      <P>The audit report of the Garda human rights working group raised important issues. While credit is due to the Garda Commissioner and the force on their initial response, we must ensure they deal with all the outstanding issues. For example, the independent audit found that procedures in practice can lead to institutional racism, particularly with regard to Nigerians, Travellers and Muslims.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough, as the Garda Commissioner said, to give a broad promise that by the end of 2007 all the proposed measures will be implemented. It will take longer unless the whole ethos of what makes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is radically changed. Some of their proposals, for example, are the plans to deal with institutional racism and racist crime. Recently, we had a situation on a local 25A bus where a Portuguese national EU citizen married to a lifelong Lucan resident was subjected to consistent racist abuse on the bus. Garda&iacute; say, initially at least, they cannot do anything about it. It might require more person hours to track the people living in the area to check for witnesses. There is, obviously, a higher level of priorities, which I understand. However, unless these issues are nipped in the bud and a zero tolerance approach is adopted and unless trial case studies can show garda&iacute; standing up for people suffering from racist abuse, public confidence will continue to fall. The same applies to human rights impact assessments as outlined in the audit report. There should also be more support for Garda staff who report human rights abuses because we all know peer pressure is strong.</P>
      <P>As a Deputy from a multicultural constituency I would like to see members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of African or Asian descent or garda&iacute; who are Muslim or from the Indian sub-continent. Quite a number of my constituents were not born in Ireland, yet few garda&iacute;, if any, have parents from outside the State. We need to see more of them in the force in order to give confidence to rapidly growing communities that they can depend on the Garda.</P>
      <P>The need to work with the Traveller community is a separate issue. I know of instances where criminal Traveller families have terrorised <Col N="33"/>other Traveller families. The culture of the Traveller is not to report to the Garda, but to move away from feuds. More needs to be done in that respect, possibly in terms of how sensitively we deal with Travellers in terms of their cultural background in order to build more liaison between the Traveller community and members of the force.</P>
      <P>Section 55 sets out 11 specific situations where the disclosure of information can reasonably be considered to be harmful. Grounds (j), for example, refer to information that &ldquo;affects adversely the international relations or interests abroad of the State, including those with Northern Ireland&rdquo;. We believe the wording is way too broad, that it can be interpreted in any which way and may have unknown economic or diplomatic effects we will not be able to quantify.</P>
      <P>One of the important parts of the Bill is section 14 that states that the Garda Commissioner &ldquo;may appoint persons as volunteer members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist it in exercising its functions&rdquo;. Volunteers should get exactly the same training as other garda&iacute; before exercising these Garda functions. I would also like to see more civilian members of the force involved in office duties so that garda&iacute; can do the job they were trained to do. This issue has caused difficulty in the past and is not covered under the terms of this Bill <i>per se</i>. It and the issue of volunteer members should be covered. If we have volunteer members and civilians working in clerical positions, they should all receive the necessary training so they can step into the breach if required.</P>
      <P>Section 122, which relates to security officers, states that an authorised body may designate a person as a security officer if satisfied that &ldquo;the person is a suitable person to exercise the powers of a security officer under this section in relation to specified premises&rdquo; and if &ldquo; the person has received adequate training for that purpose&rdquo;. We would like to see human rights training inserted in section 122 (2)(<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>) for all volunteers as part of that training. We do not want a separate structure. Perhaps a volunteer should not have to spend as long in Templemore, but they should have a training module with the same type of training as garda&iacute;, including human rights training.</P>
      <P>Currently, the majority of human rights training carried out at Templemore is interpreted human rights training in so far as people are trained to train. Human rights training is too important to be second-hand. It should be direct and should be enshrined into the thinking of a garda. My friends in the force have often told me that on becoming garda&iacute; they cannot think about people&rsquo;s social background or circumstances or what caused them to commit a crime. They are not supposed to have sympathy that would impact on their job. Human rights training is not sympathy. Human rights recognise rights enshrined under Irish and EU law and under UN charters. For that reason training in human rights is important for public confidence. We do not <Col N="34"/>need one eejit on May Day or one at an anti-war protest to be heavy-handed for lack of proper training. That is all I will say on this. Garda&iacute; need to have a good reputation if they are to continue their job in the economic circumstances over which this Government has largely presided, circumstances that have caused a number of social problems.</P>
      <P>The Green Party has a number of concerns, mentioned by Deputy Cuffe, related to section 58 with regard to the three members to form the Garda ombudsman commission. We want these positions advertised publicly. We would prefer one member because that would be someone identifiable, similar, for example, to Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
      <P>I would like to have had time to mention sections 86 and 91 but will move on to the broader picture for the time remaining. Deputy Gilmore referred to the economic boom and its fruits earlier and had an altercation with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, on the matter. I believe the economic boom as presided over by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats is a system of hire purchase in that we purchase from the future what we spend today. We will pay it back in terms of social problems that have been caused by prosperity.</P>
      <P>I speak in broad terms about anti-social behaviour, but I am also talking about the breakdown in family values that leads to situations that encourage criminal activity. I am talking about the lack of investment in our education system. I know record amounts of money have been invested in it, but given the Progressive Democrats in particular consider strongly the economic value of everything, I am sure nobody would argue that although it may seem exorbitant to invest an extra &euro;500 million, for example, into the education system, this actually saves the country in 20 years time from the cost of imprisoning people or from the cost of paying social welfare to people who were not educated to as high a standard as they could have been.</P>
      <P>This is the reason we need to nip the social decline in the bud now. We need to ensure that one in seven children do not leave primary school with reading and writing difficulties. They are the people who will not go on to do their junior or leaving certificates or go to college. They are the ones who get lower paid jobs. They are the ones who are more likely to get involved in crime. The Progressive Democrats look at these matters in economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Deputy&rsquo;s opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not going to play the bleeding heart violin, this kind of pinko lefty claptrap that gets thrown at the Green Party. I will not go on about the circumstances. However, the State will have to fork out a great deal of money on prison spaces unless it forks out slightly less now on an education system second to none. The <Col N="35"/>Government should invest in primary education and proper child care facilities. Social problems are one of the main seeding factors in crime. The potential crimes of ten or 20 years time can be nipped in the bud today by making the appropriate investment.</P>
      <P>The major issue about which people are concerned is a visible Garda presence on the streets. Lucan is the fastest growing town, while the population of north and south-west Clondalkin has mushroomed over the past 30 years, yet the number of garda&iacute; deployed in these towns has not kept pace with the population increase. There is no way the additional 20 garda&iacute; deployed in them over the past six years can cover the tenfold increase in the number of streets and roads. Above all, people want to see garda&iacute; on the street.</P>
      <P>I tabled a series of parliamentary questions to the Minister last month regarding my constituency. His replies demonstrate that, while Garda numbers in Lucan and Ronanstown stations increased by 37%, the population of Lucan south increased by 180%. There is no way, therefore, the Garda can cover the streets as well as they used to and that provides openings for opportunist politicians to engage in Garda bashing. One politician in my constituency has circulated leaflets about a guy who was attacked last February and he has stirred up fears about an anti-social behaviour epidemic. Anti-social behaviour is a universal phenomenon and it reflects the social problems in which the Government needs to invest. However, most areas are not subject to a crime epidemic in that while there is too much crime, it does not amount to an epidemic. People need to work with the Garda through the neighbourhood watch scheme and the proposed community fora to counteract this problem. However, it is wrong for meetings to be held where people are given an opportunity to spout their genuine fears and concerns but where, instead, the Garda on the ground are attacked. This results in political gain for the wrong reason.</P>
      <P>The Minister needs to tackle the issue of Garda numbers. The lord mayor&rsquo;s commission, for example, estimates that for every ten garda&iacute; recruited, only one is deployed on the street. Of the proposed 2,000 additional recruits, only 200 will be deployed nationwide when retirement, illness and so on are taken into account, which is a pittance. Four shifts &mdash; A, B, C and D &mdash; must be covered and there is no difference in the numbers rostered between day and night shifts when sickness and overtime are considered. More garda&iacute; are needed on the street and there should be increased investment in Garda resources. Significant investment is also needed in mountain bike Garda units because they combine the best aspects of garda&iacute; on the beat, which people want, and mobility.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to invest in the causes of the social problems that lead to crime and it also needs to invest in the Garda so that it has <Col N="36"/>the tools to do the job. The Garda does a good job with limited resources. The issues of Garda accountability and institutional racism also need to be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Members who contributed to this extensive debate. Their detailed interest in its provisions reflects its importance as the most significant reform of the Garda since the foundation of the State. The Minister looks forward to a continuing and constructive input from Members on Committee Stage. Following the line the Minister took in the Seanad, he is open to suggestions that may be tabled with the intention of improving the Bill and he will examine carefully amendments that are put to him in that vein. I have been asked by the Minister to comment on the more substantive issues that came up in the debate. However, if I do not have enough time to comment on other points raised by Members, they can be revisited on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The question of setting up a policing board or authority for the Garda was raised principally by Deputies Costello, Quinn, Broughan and Howlin. The Deputies are impressed with the work carried out by the Patten commission and its seminal report on policing in Northern Ireland. Who could not be impressed with that major undertaking and its recommendations? However, the Minister believes we should be careful about extrapolating recommendations drawn up in the specific context of the proper development of the policing function in a deeply divided and polarised society and applying them in a context where these considerations do not arise. This issue was touched on at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on 10 March last, in the context of its work on community policing as part of its ongoing examination of the development of the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>The creation of a police authority in the context of Northern Ireland, as recommended by Patten, makes sense given the need to accommodate and give a voice to the various strands of political opinion there. None of these factors is present in our case. Furthermore, unlike the greater part of the UK, where there are 43 different regional constabularies and where the concept of regional police authorities may also have merit, Ireland has only one police force. It was pointed out in an article in <i>The Times</i> on 15 March that:</P>
      <P LI="1">The level of democratic accountability to which the police are subject in Britain today is woeful. The police authorities who exercise nominal responsibility for holding the police accountable are staffed by well-meaning and in many cases capable individuals. But they have limited powers and operate without a direct mandate.</P><Col N="37"/>
      <P FLI="0">It is a basic principle of a democracy that the police should be accountable to the democratically elected representatives of the community they serve. The best way to ensure that in Ireland is the direct way, that is, through immediate and effective procedures ensuring ministerial accountability to Parliament. Where police are organised on a regional level, they are normally accountable to the appropriate local government representative. For example, the New York Police Department reports to the mayor of New York. Where police are organised at a national level, they are normally accountable to a minister of central government. This applies in the USA with the FBI, in Canada with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and in most EU countries.</P>
      <P>The State has one police force, which is part of the Executive arm of the State and which is answerable through the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Houses of the Oireachtas for all aspects of the policing function, including the State security aspects. The structure recommended by Patten, therefore, is appropriate to a regional police service within the UK structure, particularly in Northern Ireland where there are difficulties as regards local government and elected representatives. However, one cannot take a model designed for a multiplicity of regional police services and apply it to a national police service. It does not make sense and it does not follow the model found in the vast majority of western democracies. Moreover, the introduction of a Garda authority would introduce an extra layer of bureaucracy and serve to transfer the supervisory role of the D&aacute;il to an unelected Garda authority. The Minister does not see how this would improve efficiency or accountability. Does anyone believe that democratic accountability would be served if the Minister was not called to account to reply to parliamentary questions and debates on policing and crime issues because such matters were the responsibility of an independent policing board?</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello also raised the issue of a commission on policing to tour the highways and byways seeking opinion on proposals for reform of policing. While the Minister acknowledges the general merit of such an idea, his view when he assumed office was that there had been enough talking and that it was time for action. The Bill&rsquo;s proposals reflect the outcome of a thorough review and consultation process. A review of the Garda as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic management initiative set down key principles for the future management of the force, which have been taken on board. In essence these were a need for clarity as to the roles and functions of the Minister and the Garda; operational responsibility, including financial responsibility, should be assigned to the management of the Garda; the level of democratic accountability should be enhanced; and all this should be achieved in an open and transparent fashion.</P>
      <P>The Minister was also conscious of the need for wide consultation. For that reason, he decided to <Col N="38"/>publish the general scheme of the Bill in July 2003 and invite submissions from interested groups and the public in general. He consulted Garda management and held meetings with several of the Garda associations which are still ongoing. He also met the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to discuss draft proposals and hear members&rsquo; views. He is grateful to all those who expressed views on the general scheme, whether supportive or critical. In hindsight, the Minister has said he is glad he chose to act.</P>
      <P>We could talk forever without making progress. We have before us a concrete Bill to debate, and as the Minister showed in the Seanad, he is open to suggestions and amendments, provided they are backed by convincing argument. The important matters of anti-social behaviour and community policing were raised by several Deputies across the House. The Government is acutely aware of those problems, and there are several provisions in the Bill designed to tackle such issues. That is one of the main reasons the Bill is so important. For the first time, it clarifies in statutory form the sensitive relationships between the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner in areas where there are crossovers between purely operational matters for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and matters of great public concern.</P>
      <P>First, there are provisions in chapter 4 of the Bill relating to co-operation with local authorities and arrangements for obtaining the views of the public. They deal in the main with the establishment of joint policing committees and local communities. I shall deal with that in greater detail in a moment. Second, the Bill provides, in section 19, for the setting of policing priorities by the Minister in consultation with the Commissioner, and any details in that regard are to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Then there is the obligation on the Commissioner set out in section 20 of the Bill to prepare a strategy statement to take account of Government policy or any priority set by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>A requirement is set out in section 21 for the Commissioner to prepare an annual policing plan that will have regard to those priority strategies and Government policies. That plan will also have regard to written policy directives issued by the Minister with Government approval. This scheme will provide for the most effective response to the most pressing issues that may arise from the overall context of policing in the future.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the difficulties that arise from the adherence to the old boundaries that were laid down for Garda district divisions and the fact that they are out of line geographically with the modern county boundaries. Section 21 of the Bill, to which I have already referred in the context of the preparation of an annual policing plan by the Commissioner, pro<Col N="39"/>vides that the plan may include proposals to alter those boundaries.</P>
      <P>Apart from those provisions, the Minister accepts that, at a more immediate and practical level, further action is required to deal with the growth in the phenomenon of anti-social behaviour. New legislative provisions are planned for inclusion by way of amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill currently before the House. There has been much ill-informed comment and speculation in the media about those proposals. The Minister is nevertheless satisfied that Members will agree that they provide a measured response to the problem and will alleviate the plight of ordinary citizens and families who are being threatened, intimidated and terrorised in their communities by local thugs. I should also mention that another amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill will deal with an issue raised by a Deputy about problems with obtaining search warrants at certain periods arising from a recent court decision.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very encouraged by the general welcome given by the House to the provisions dealing with co-operation between the garda&iacute; and local authorities. He adds that the precise composition and working arrangements for the joint policing committees will be the subject of further debate on the relevant sections of the Bill. He believes that the legislation should not be over-prescriptive as to the nature of the representation of any of the parties involved, so as to allow maximum flexibility, within overall parameters, to cater for the infinite variety of local situations. However, he is willing to consider highlighting the role of local policing committees or fora in the legislation. That matter has been impressed upon him by the chairman of the National Crime Council. It was also referred to by several Deputies during the course of their contributions. The issue was also considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights during its review of community policing generally, and whom the Minister met, and he looks forward to receiving its views on the matter in due course. I understand from a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the committee&rsquo;s report will be published before the end of this month.</P>
      <P>A point was made about the possibility of the appointment by Government of non-garda&iacute; as senior officers of the force. The existing position is that Garda superintendents, chief superintendents and assistant commissioners are all selected by means of an internal Garda competition based on merit before being appointed by the Government. The Bill maintains the existing position and goes further. Following an Opposition amendment in the Seanad, to which the Minister agreed, all such appointments must, henceforth, be in accordance with regulations. That makes it clear that the selection process will continue to be merit-based without political involvement. The real significance of senior ranks being appointed <Col N="40"/>by the Government is that they can only be dismissed by the Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of the Garda ombudsman commission, a question was raised about why it has to be a three-person body. All options were considered, and the Government came down in favour of a three-person commission. While I appreciate the point about the advantages of having a single recognisable person identified with the job, there may be advantages in depersonalising the commission. As the Minister said in the Seanad, we do not question which members of the Supreme Court hand down particular judgments, nor do we ask who the three members of the Revenue Commissioners are. I am sure the three-person composition of the commission will not be a disadvantage or serve to reduce its status or effectiveness.</P>
      <P>An ombudsman-type institution does not have to have a single person in charge, and it is not unprecedented internationally. There are examples of ombudsman-type bodies with more than one person sitting on them. Indeed, the new organisation that will deal with complaints against the police in England and Wales, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which replaces the Police Complaints Authority, has a chairman and two deputy chairmen. Providing for three members increases the chance that an internal debate will take place before any decision is made. In those circumstances, the commission is likely to act deliberatively and to have thought through carefully the consequences of its actions. There is also the advantage of the workload being shared.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s technical points on this subject, the Minister has asked me to say that the Bill proceeds on the assumption that the three members of the commission will, as far as possible, act collectively as a collegiate body. One of the key provisions relating to the commission is that it is an independent body. It would be inconsistent with that policy if a member were precluded from producing a minority report should he or she wish to do so. Again, arising from its independence, it will be a matter for the commission to arrange how it conducts its business.</P>
      <P>As for the question of the removal of members of the commission from office for stated misbehaviour, among other things, as provided for in section 61(2), that is one of the formulae used in such cases. Effectively, it is a matter for both Houses of the Oireachtas. As to inserting a specific provision in the Bill providing that a criminal record will bar a person from being appointed as a member of the commission, we can take it that no Government would consider proposing a person for nomination and the passing of the necessary resolutions by both Houses in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in his speech that he thought he might hear it said that the Bill provides for garda&iacute; to investigate garda&iacute;, although he did not expect to hear it so soon after he had <Col N="41"/>explained this is simply not the case. Some further elaboration might assist in clarifying the position. The provisions of the Bill follow very closely the relevant provisions &mdash; sections 56 and 57 &mdash; of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which established the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Those provisions in turn were developed from the recommendations in the 1997 report by Senator Maurice Hayes. Senator Hayes concentrated on three main models for investigation of complaints against the police following his comprehensive study of the various systems in operation in other jurisdictions around the world. Those were investigation by the police with external oversight, complete handling and investigation of police misconduct by a body external to the police service and a combination of police investigation with external oversight for more minor matters, with more serious ones being investigated by the external body. The first of these more or less corresponded with the system then in place in Northern Ireland, England and Wales. Some variations of it were found in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board in this jurisdiction, which was provided for in the 1986 Act, and in similar bodies in New Zealand and Ontario.</P>
      <P>As regards the second option, complete handling and investigation of police misconduct by a body external to the police service, it is significant that Senator Maurice Hayes said he knew of no example of an external body investigating completely all cases and recommending civil or disciplinary action. A quote from the relevant paragraph of the Senator&rsquo;s report is illuminating. He noted that such a system:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">would remove the responsibility completely from the police [even for the most minor cases]. It would do this at a time when there is a need and a drive, not least from within the police, for greater management responsibility in the police service. It would also present difficulties in terms of finding sufficient investigating officers to manage the workload. There would also be problems in breaking into the police culture. Such a body is unlikely to gain police confidence easily and this in turn is bound to affect its credibility.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The final option involves a combination of police investigation with external oversight for minor matters and investigation by the external body for more serious matters. Under this option, informal resolution may also be employed by the police for minor matters. Senator Hayes concluded that the police complaints service in Northern Ireland should ideally adopt a variant of this system. He also said that in view of the lack of confidence in the system in that jurisdiction, the ombudsman should probably investigate all complaints other than those considered suitable for informal resolution.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes recommended that complaints should be categorised under three headings. The first category is serious complaints <Col N="42"/>which may involve criminal action, such as the death or serious injury of a person while in custody. The complaints body should have a statutory duty to investigate such complaints. The second category relates to substantial but less serious complaints which might be remitted to the police for supervised or unsupervised investigation and report, at the discretion of the complaints body. The third category is complaints about quality of service, which would be remitted to the police for informal resolution.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister has been exhorted to follow as far as possible the set of circumstances that obtains in Northern Ireland, it is strange that Deputies have suggested that the approach in this jurisdiction should depart radically from the approach adopted on the other side of the Border. Sections 83 to 91 of the Bill outline the ways in which complaints against the Garda will be investigated by the independent ombudsman commission. In cases of death or serious harm to a person, the ombudsman commission will investigate the matter. That applies even if no complaint has been made. The commission will be able to require the Garda Commissioner to investigate the matter subject to certain conditions and safeguards in other cases, or it can directly supervise the Garda investigation, with certain conditions attached. In that context, the Minister does not see how one can allege that the Bill provides for garda&iacute; to investigate themselves. It clearly provides for the ombudsman commission to retain control and direction over all proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Minister has heard people suggesting on a number of occasions since the Bill was published, including in the House during this debate, that the Bill requires the ombudsman commission to give notice to the Garda Commissioner of its intention to search a Garda station. That suggestion is completely inaccurate. As the Minister said at the start of the Second Stage debate, the provision relating to the giving of notice will apply only in the cases of certain Garda stations which will be designated in regulations to be made in accordance with section 117.</P>
      <P>The Bill strikes a careful balance between the need for adequate information-gathering powers and the importance of preserving secrecy in the case of sensitive security-related matters. Section 91(5) allows the Minister to give specific details about the matters to be excluded. Any exclusionary direction by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is subject to a review of the operation of the provisions by a designated judge of the High Court, who reports to the Taoiseach, who in turn lays such a report before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the establishment of a police authority would obviate the need for a Garda inspectorate. The Minister has made clear his position on the establishment of such an authority and I do not propose to add to that. It has also been proposed that the ombudsman commission should perform the functions proposed <Col N="43"/>for the Garda inspectorate, to avoid the duplication of functions. In that context, I remind Deputies of the Minister&rsquo;s comments about the background to the inspectorate, which is being established in response to a recommendation in the first report of the Morris tribunal, which was that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be empowered by knowledge.</P>
      <P>The proposed Garda inspectorate is designed to ensure that independent and objective information on matters relating to the functioning of the force will be available to the Minister and the Department and that potential gaps in information or knowledge will be addressed. The inspectorate will be primarily concerned with operational matters and issues of administrative systems. The ombudsman commission, on the other hand, will be primarily concerned with investigations into the conduct of individual members of the force while performing their official duties. The Bill provides that the ombudsman commission will be able to examine some of the force&rsquo;s practices, policies and procedures. While that function may lead to confusion about the differing roles of the commission and the inspectorate, I remind Deputies that the commission&rsquo;s role in this area is directed at practices, policies and procedures which lead to complaints from the public. The commission will not be concerned with such matters in any other context.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepts that there is potential for the investigations or examinations of the ombudsman commission and the inspectorate to coincide. Just as the commission and the Garda Commissioner will be required to draw up protocols when dual investigations into criminal matters arise, the commission will have to agree protocols with the inspectorate when their respective investigations or inquiries coincide.</P>
      <P>Reservations were expressed about the independence of the ombudsman commission if existing administrative staff of the complaints board are allowed to work for the new body. This matter is addressed in section 64. Practical considerations relating to the provision of expertise to the commission need to be considered in this regard. The Minister has asked me to emphasise that this is a matter of administrative functions rather than the commission&rsquo;s investigatory functions. The commission&rsquo;s designated officers will be its permanent investigative staff. They will be charged with conducting the investigations that the commission determines should be taken, particularly in the most serious cases. Such cases will typically involve death or serious harm, or other serious matters such as fraud or corruption. It is intended that the commission will seek to maintain a balanced and diverse staff of trained investigators from a wide range of backgrounds. Such staff could be former officials of the Customs and Excise service, tax investigators, company law inspectors, accountants or lawyers. The balance will change over time.</P><Col N="44"/>
      <P>The Minister agrees with the recommendations of Senator Maurice Hayes&rsquo;s report on the question of whether members of the Garda should be allowed to take up positions with the ombudsman commission. As their presence might be considered by the commission to be so important for its success that it would outweigh and negate possible credibility issues, it would be wrong to rule them out. It should be borne in mind that the commission&rsquo;s staff will be officers of the commission and, therefore, under its direction and control. Policemen are allowed to become investigators in other systems throughout the world, for various reasons. As Senator Maurice Hayes noted in his report, the overriding consideration is the real possibility that the body will not be as effective as it could be if it does not employ people who are familiar with and able to break into the culture of the police. That would affect the credibility of the system.</P>
      <P>The police ombudsman in Northern Ireland has not yet opted to recruit members of the PSNI. As I said, that relates to the particular circumstances in that jurisdiction. The senior investigation officers in the Northern Ireland police ombudsman&rsquo;s office are drawn from other police services, most notably and for obvious reasons from various police forces throughout the UK. Not only do they take charge of investigations but, crucially, they also help to train the non-police investigative staff to the levels required to conduct criminal investigations. If the ombudsman commission wishes to engage the services of policemen drawn from the senior ranks of foreign police services, what objection is there to it recruiting such staff from the ranks of senior Garda officers here? It has been said that the positions on the ombudsman commission should be publicly advertised. It is too early to say what the position will be in this regard. It will be carefully considered when the Bill has been enacted.</P>
      <P>It was asked why we do not establish an intelligence service if State security is so important. There is no need to do so. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been responsible for this service since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies argued that the time limit for submitting complaints is too short or should be capped. There were differing opinions on this matter. Views were expressed that the time limit of six months as prescribed in section 76 is too short while others considered that there should be an upper limit of 12 months. The approach adopted in the Bill is fair and strikes the right balance between the need to have a reasonable period to lodge a complaint while allowing the ombudsman commission discretion to extend the period if it considers that there are good reasons for doing so.</P>
      <P>Any discussion on the matter of resources would be premature at this point. In keeping with the policy as reflected in the Bill, underscoring the independence of the ombudsman commission, the issues going to the heart of the <Col N="45"/>resources question will only become clearer when the members of the commission are appointed.</P>
      <P>It was said that it is not clear that a complaint made by a member of the public at a Garda station under section 75(2) will be sent to the ombudsman commission unless the complainant requests it. The Bill as a matter of policy provides for all complaints to be sent to the ombudsman commission in the first instance so there is no need for complainants to request that explicitly. Section 75 sets out the ways in which complaints can be made to the ombudsman commission, either directly to the commission or by way of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for forwarding to the commission. It is clear from section 77 that the Garda Commissioner or any other member of the force, having received a complaint, must send it to the ombudsman commission. The involvement of the ombudsman commission in a supervisory function should be mandatory in all cases rather than discretionary.</P>
      <P>Deputies should not lose sight of the fact that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for all matters relating to discipline within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The provisions of the Bill dealing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission have been drafted with that very much to the fore. They are also designed to provide for a flexible approach on the part of the commission and to allow it to exercise its own discretion as to how investigations are to be carried out. This is a reasonable and balanced approach which takes account of the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s responsibilities as chief executive of the force for the quality of service provided by the members of the organisation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, this approach is strictly in accordance with the procedure recommended in the Hayes report. This envisaged that in the third category of complaints identified &mdash; the less serious complaints dealing with quality of service type matters &mdash; the police themselves could do the investigation.</P>
      <P>It was asked if there should be one ombudsman, North and South, to hear complaints about the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. That could not be allowed to happen under any circumstances. No case can be made for such an approach.</P>
      <P>A doubt was expressed by some Deputies about the adequacy of training for members of the volunteer force and questions were raised as to whether volunteers would have the same two-year training regime as full-time members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Bill provides in section 14 that volunteer members will have the prescribed training as set out in proposals by the Garda Commissioner to the Minister which will then be set out in detailed regulations. These regulations will also cover terms and conditions of service. Accordingly, the detail of the training arrangements will be settled in that context. Most emphatically, this is not a form of policing on the cheap. It is a valuable adjunct to policing and it is well recognised and developed as such in other countries. Why should we be any different?</P><Col N="46"/>
      <P>Reference was made to section 16 which concerns the code of ethics, and it was mentioned that the Bill does not contain a definition of human rights. Human rights is a term which means different things to different people and is trammelled with popular misconceptions, false expectations and prejudices. Generally speaking, it is a term which embraces what may be termed the classic civil and political rights as covered by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Constitution in Article 40 refers to &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo;. The Bill places emphasis on the importance of upholding human rights in the performance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of its functions. Section 15 provides for a revised form of declaration for persons joining the force which specifically refers to the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties. In the light of the passage of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, which came into operation on 31 December of that year, it was not necessary to define what is meant by human rights.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of a code of ethics for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the purpose of the code will be to lay down standards of conduct and practice for members. Deputies might have noticed that in establishing such a code, provision is made for the Garda Commissioner to consult the Human Rights Commission. The Minister is not sure about the need to include the National Disability Authority in the list of bodies to be consulted as it would be caught by the provision in section 15(3)(<i>g</i>), but he will consider the point between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The recent human rights audit of the force as published by the Commissioner has focussed attention on the need for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop its response to the training and development of its members in this fundamental area. The provisions of the Bill provide the necessary statutory mechanisms for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The question of garda&iacute; having access to the ombudsman commission for the purpose of making complaints against other members was raised with me by the Garda associations in the context of discussions about the existing grievance procedure. The ombudsman commission provisions of the Bill are directed at restoring public confidence in the complaints system and on policy grounds they cannot be stretched to deal with complaints by members against other members. The provisions in the Bill which allow the ombudsman commission to undertake investigations of its own volition or at the request of the Minister, which are to be found in sections 94(4) and (5), respectively, are sufficient to deal with the issue of complaints by members against other members.</P>
      <P>It may be that special provisions outside of this Bill may be needed to deal with this issue. It is possible that the matter could be addressed by Garda management in this form or that specific <Col N="47"/>legislation along the lines of that recently enacted for the Defence Forces could be considered.</P>
      <P>Will the ombudsman commission be able to investigate circumstances where members of the force are willed properties by elderly persons? This will be a matter for the ombudsman commission to decide. The key issue is whether the conduct of the member concerned would constitute misbehaviour.</P>
      <P>Deputies called for more information on ministerial directives, saying that they give too much power to the Minister. This Bill, far from being a vehicle for political interference, is the reverse. Clearly, it is entirely improper for the Government to try to influence the course of a Garda criminal investigation or prosecution. For the first time, this Bill in section 22(4) gives statutory force to the independence of the Garda in this area.</P>
      <P>It is entirely proper, however, for the Government to give directions to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to implement policies in the public interest. The police are part of the Executive arm of the State, not an independent agency. If examples from other countries are required, section 5 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act provides that the RCMP Commissioner is under the direction of the Minister. Section 40 of the British Police Act 1996 provides that the Home Secretary may, in specific circumstances, give directions to the relevant police authority to take such measures as may be specified in the direction.</P>
      <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill will provide for the first time a clear statutory definition of the respective roles of the Minister and the Commissioner. The Bill represents a balanced mechanism for accountability to the Government and Oireachtas while providing the Commissioner with the necessary authority to exercise his policing functions efficiently and with efficacy.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Section 32(5) deals with privilege and redress in circumstances where a person makes a statement which later proves to be wrong. This provision was introduced in Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the context of changes to the joint policing committee provisions of the Bill. It is modelled on the provision in section 104 which deals with qualified privilege for certain statements and publications of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman commission. In the light of Deputy Stanton&rsquo;s comments, I will look at these provisions again in consultation with Parliamentary Counsel.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Land Bill 2004 and its provisions to modernise the legislation on land that was held under the auspices of the former Land Commission. The Land Commission was originally established in 1881 to fix rents. It later became the Tenant Purchase Agency and bought land for tenants. Because many of the tenants were unable to buy the land, the principle of a land annuity was introduced. The capital which was provided to the purchaser by the Land Commission was repaid over a number of years as an annuity. That system facilitated the tenant purchasers to buy their own land over a period, thus easing the burden of repayment as a capital sum. Of its time it was a good idea but the carry-over from that has left a number of farmers carrying on with that annuity, and times have changed significantly.</P>
      <P>Irish land law is characterised by its complexity and the archaic nature of some of its provisions. The purpose of the Bill is to simplify the procedures as they apply to agricultural land held under the tenant purchase scheme of 1881.</P>
      <P>I broadly welcome the provisions of the Bill to discharge land held under low annuities and provide a mechanism to encourage farmers to clear their annuities at a discount. The outcome of that should be a reduction in the bureaucracy involved in dealing with the annuities and a general tidy up operation of the land annuities.</P>
      <P>The level of the annuity to be written off, however, is a very modest &euro;200. That will be welcomed but the level should be increased to &euro;400 as suggested by many of the farming organisations. Increasing the level to &euro;400 would benefit more than 5,000 farmers. Indeed, the cost of collecting an annuity of less than &euro;400 would be greater than the financial gain to be had from retaining the level at &euro;200. That is a financial consideration that should be worked out in terms of raising the level from &euro;200 to &euro;400.</P>
      <P>The timescale within which the offer is available is very short. I ask the Minister to consider that in light of difficulties farmers may experience in accessing funding and arranging loans to deal with that. This point was raised by Deputy Naughten previously and it was also raised in the Seanad. Many farmers may not be in a position to avail of the offer within a short timeframe but they may be able to do so over a longer period. They should be given the opportunity to put in place some provisions whereby they could raise the necessary finance to avail of the offer.</P><Col N="49"/>
      <P>Concern has been expressed that the Bill will give rights to the Department to offset other payments due from the Department in lieu of land annuities owed. That is a major point that must be addressed on behalf of farmers. It could cause considerable problems and should be taken into account by the Minister because safeguards are needed to ensure farmers do not become victims of the system and find themselves in further financial difficulty without being given an opportunity to restructure their repayments to allow them to be better able to make the annuity payments in the future. For example, in the case of a farmer not receiving EU payments, the Department will be given authority to seek attachment of moneys due to a farmer from a purchaser of foreign produce. The implications of that for a farmer could be very significant. That point must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the simplification provisions in respect of the transfer and change of ownership of land in trust. That will benefit sporting organisations. It will benefit a number of GAA clubs in particular and allow for investment in their lands within their current use. That is welcome. In light of the recent welcome decisions by the GAA on other fronts, it is appropriate that it should be given the scope and the opportunity to invest. There should be significant community benefit from this measure and in allowing sporting clubs, particularly the GAA, to make this investment, there should be a knock-on effect of benefit to the community. I would welcome that and I hope it happens.</P>
      <P>I welcome the abolition of section 45 of the Land Act 1965. I was surprised to find that 300 to 400 applications are still made on an annual basis by persons held to be non-qualified under the 1965 Act and that they have to obtain the consent of the Minister to acquire an interest in agricultural land. The original section 45 was intended to restrict ownership of agricultural land by non-Irish persons and corporate bodies. Whatever the historical reasons for this provision, they are now outdated. We cannot discriminate against EU nationals and, therefore, many people would count as qualified persons. Furthermore, I would be reluctant to uphold a provision that seeks to regulate ownership <i>per se</i> as opposed to use. My colleague, Deputy Naughten, was somewhat concerned that people from Dublin who had land in the country would be put off by the smell of slurry, for instance. I would not have any such concerns. I was not sure what point he was making about qualified persons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I assure him that the people of Dublin South-Central would not have any such qualms or reservations about heading down to the country. They would be very familiar and comfortable with it.</P><Col N="50"/>
      <P>The Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act of 1992 abolished the Land Commission and transferred its property and powers to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. One section refers to moneys owed by the Department. I would like the Minister to consider whether it is appropriate to refer to her Department rather than her office. That is a technical point and one I will raise again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to regularise technical inaccuracies and omissions in the 1992 Act. That is welcome and points to the extremely technical and complex nature of this area. I will table amendments on Committee Stage that seek to avoid the same pitfalls as those in the 2004 Bill. I look forward to addressing those on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome any provisions that will reduce the level of bureaucracy for farmers and indeed the officials who have to manage the bureaucratic system. Farmers are already burdened with enough bureaucracy and anything we can do to lighten that load is to be welcomed. The final outcome is that farmers who have land purchase annuities will finally have ownership of their own land with all the benefits full ownership entails.</P>
      <P>In broad terms I welcome the Bill and look forward to addressing on Committee Stage some of the specific points I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on a land Bill. When I look across at the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, I am reminded that it is over 20 years since I sat where he is sitting now. That was the beginning of the end for the Land Commission as we knew it. Some of us had great plans in terms of land acquisition but, unfortunately, for a variety of reasons that make no difference to anyone now, they did not work.</P>
      <P>Many people regret the way events turned out. There was a reference to economic factors in the Minister&rsquo;s contribution with which I agree because that has nothing to do with whether one has the capability of farming or is a big, small, efficient or inefficient farmer. It depends entirely on the size of the cheque book and, unfortunately, much of the land being purchased now has nothing to do with providing a livelihood for anybody living and working on the land. It seems no one has the answer to that problem. I will return to that matter later.</P>
      <P>I welcome, in principle, a number of aspects of the Bill. There are one or two provisions on which I am surprised the Minister of State did not go a little further, including those on annuities. A debt of approximately &euro;1 million remains outstanding. There have been other write-offs through the years and I would have thought the people who drew up the Bill would have made a great effort to remove the Land Commission from the equation. While I do not know if the Minister of State had an input before he was appointed, someone like him would have understood the background to this issue. While I accept that money is legitimately owed to the Land <Col N="51"/>Commission, people throughout Ireland were allocated land in the 1970s and 1980s which they desperately wanted but which was uneconomical to farm. A number of farming families will know exactly what I meant when I say they would have been better off if they had never seen it. At the time, if land was available on the other side of a boundary fence and the farming blood was any way right in one, one wanted it. I am sure the same blood runs in the veins of the Minister of State as runs in mine.</P>
      <P>Times have changed and people&rsquo;s first consideration now is the economic value of land. There are many people who purchased extraordinarily expensive land from the Land Commission, which was not the fault of the body which had to pay the going rate for it. Many of those people have been left with very significant repayments to the Land Commission. I do not make the case that people should not have to meet their obligations and pay back what they owe, but while the 25% discount the Government seeks to provide is better than none, I would have thought it would have gone further. A 50% discount should be applied and people should be given sufficient time to get their affairs in order. Pressure could then be put on people who owe the Land Commission money and a great effort could be made to get over the problem for good.</P>
      <P>Given the cost to the system of collecting the money owed, civil servants would be much better employed carrying out other functions. It is a waste of time. An incentive should be provided to get money into the Exchequer which could, in turn, be put to better use. I do not know if such proposals have been put to the Minister of State but it appears to be the action to take. There will always be people who refuse to pay a penny to anyone and I do not make a case for them. A 25% discount based on an already inflated bill levied on people in an uneconomical business will not encourage a response from the category of people who are in serious trouble and who constitute the greatest difficulty for the Land Commission. I am sure we will return to the matter on Committee Stage at which point the Bill&rsquo;s provisions should be re-examined fundamentally.</P>
      <P>I have no idea of the exact figures but assume the Department has gone through them with a fine-tooth comb. While I assume also that the discount had to be approved by the Department of Finance, a fundamental mistake has been made. There is an opportunity to wipe out most of the debt within the next year or two. It has been questioned whether the &euro;200 threshold below which outstanding debts will be written off should be raised to &euro;300 or &euro;400. I have not seen the figures involved and am not sure what it means. A little more imagination and courage should be applied. The Exchequer would be better served by using whatever funding accrued from a write-off at a higher level than proposed than by hanging around looking for money for the next 20 years.</P><Col N="52"/>
      <P>I like the provisions on trustees although time does not permit me to address them fully. Given the great many rows and fights in rural Ireland about who was appointed as a trustee and failures to fill vacancies, whatever measures are introduced to finalise matters will constitute a fine day&rsquo;s work. Everybody will approve.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to know why provisions have been made on powers of attachment and to understand how they will work in practice. If it turns out that a farmer is unable to meet debts to the Land Commission and there are no moneys to be paid to him or her through the Department, I understand it is possible to place a power of attachment on the manager of a local mart. In such a case, the cheque for a farmer who has sold cattle can be sent to the Department of Agriculture and Food. It should be clearly spelt out if this is the case. I do not like it. No more than the Minister of State, I have had many dealings with the Land Commission over the years and have always found its officials to be very fair and flexible where they encountered genuine cases. The power of attachment, on the other hand, is a blunt instrument.</P>
      <P>Many deals have been made with farmers in which only half any premia payments in a given year were taken to allow them to live and rear their families. I have often seen repayments spread over four or five years with the result that indebtedness to the Land Commission could be cleared while the farmers in question could continue to make a living. If the Department uses the blunt instrument of power of attachment to clear a significant debt in one fell swoop when a farmer sells milk to a creamery or sheep or cattle at a mart, it will serve to put him or her out of business. Great care should be taken in this context.</P>

      <P>While the Land Bill deals with ownership we must take into account that straightforward ownership is no longer sufficient in terms of this legislation. We should also take into account that the virtual ownership of land must be considered in terms of the predatory policies of the GM companies. For example, in legal terms a land owner is the actual owner of the land but, increasingly in law in other countries where GM food is grown, the GM company is in many ways the franchise holder of that land. Once land has gone into GM production it is no longer possible to grow organically on it. Conventional crops are effectively compromised because of the GM history of the land.</P>
      <P>The Department must take into account the more complex nature of land ownership in the future. I hope we will not have to countenance GM crops. Many farmers would not like to be faced with that compromise situation and are resisting it. Some farmers in Tipperary are taking the initiative and producing their own GM-free farm signs which they sell to landowners, including farmers, so that they can make a strong case that their land is to be GM free.</P>
      <P>The longer-term investment in land ownership also changes the nature of what is being discussed in the Land Bill. For example, it would be more fruitful if forestry grants were fully restored and if the potential of forestry was realised. That would be of benefit not only to farmers in respect of long-term income but also in terms of biodiversity and tourism.</P>
      <P>The Bill is all the more important because of the potential for many farmers to get involved in <Col N="54"/>energy production, which is one of the challenges we will face. We must work with farmers to devise ways in which land can be best utilised. Traditionally, food production has been a primary land use but, increasingly, energy and building materials are becoming necessary crops. I accept there has been movement on anaerobic digestion and biomass. There was an excellent biofuel conference yesterday in Carlow, which was organised by the Green Party to try to provide a positive option for many of the sugar beet growers who are currently faced with a bleak future due to the closure of the Carlow sugar factory. I welcome the Bill which provides an opportunity for us to reflect on the nature of land use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate on the Land Bill is an important one. Land is an intrinsic part of our history and culture. Before I go into the detail of the legislation I wish to remember the great Michael Davitt and the Land League, a movement which focused on rights for tenants and respect for people and their communities. Davitt&rsquo;s views are still relevant and we can learn lessons from him. He made a significant contribution to the development of the State in terms of land and tenants. We could also learn something from his approach that would assist in the peace process in Northern Ireland. He promoted inclusiveness, respect for people and their diversity and a move to democratic principles. There is an excellent opportunity for us to use this tradition to help us in the peace process.</P>
      <P>It is important when dealing with a land issue to focus on speculators and the housing crisis. Up to 100,000 people on local authority waiting lists are directly affected. There is a connection between the price of land and affordable housing. It is important that we look at these issues and keep the focus on quality planning.</P>
      <P>Ground rents are another matter of concern. I regret that successive Governments have not tackled this issue. I have long been a supporter of the National Association of Tenants Organisation, NATO, and the Association of Combined Residents Associations. I commend them on their work on ground rents in the past 20 years. In particular, I pay tribute to Tony O&rsquo;Toole who was involved in ACRA when I began my political career. He did a great deal of work on ground rents. I wish to put on record my total support for the ACRA campaign.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission was originally set up in 1881 as a rent-fixing body under the Land Law (Ireland) Act of that year. It subsequently developed by law into a tenant-purchase agency and assisted with the purchase by tenants of 13.5 million acres of land. Ultimately the commission embarked on a countrywide programme of land structural reform and became a great purchaser and distributor of land. Acquisition of land ceased in 1983. The Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act 1992, which came into operation on 31 March 1999, transferred the property of the Land Commission and functions of the lay <Col N="55"/>commissioners to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>The matters dealt with in the Land Bill concern land purchase-land reclamation annuities, the simplification of transfer of ownership and amendments to various Land Acts for simpler and more efficient administration. I welcome these provisions. The Bill proposes to discharge all land purchase annuities-land reclamation annuities amounting to &euro;200 or less per annum, including arrears. It also provides for a land annuities-land reclamation annuities buy-out scheme for amounts greater than &euro;200 per annum which would allow farmers to clear their existing land annuities at a discount of 25% subject to all outstanding arrears being paid in full.</P>
      <P>These are important sections in the legislation. Section 10 provides legal authority for previous Government decisions to write-off small land purchase and land reclamation annuities.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce to the House the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005. The Bill amends the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 and establishes a statutory body to administer a &euro;12.7 million education fund for former residents of institutions and their families.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the purpose of the Bill, it is important to highlight the general background and context of the legislation. In recent years Irish society has been confronted with the reality that many people were subjected to serious abuse as children. This occurred in homes and in institutions charged with the care and protection of <Col N="56"/>children, many of which were orphanages, industrial schools and reformatories owned or managed by religious orders and funded in whole or part from State funds.</P>
      <P>There are many victims of this abuse in our community who have grown into adulthood carrying the emotional and psychological scars of abuse. I know that, like me, many Deputies will remember the occasion on 11 May 1999 when, on behalf of the State, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, apologised to all victims of abuse for the suffering they endured as children and for our failure as a society to provide the care, attention, love and support to which all children are entitled. On that day the Taoiseach announced a range of Government measures to redress the abuse.</P>
      <P>These measures included the establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, amendments to the Statute of Limitations and the establishment of a national counselling service. This initiative was followed up subsequently by the announcement of a financial redress scheme for victims of abuse and the establishment of a statutory Redress Board to administer such a scheme.</P>
      <P>The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was formally established in May 2000. The broad terms of reference were:&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="1">To afford victims of abuse in childhood an opportunity to tell of the abuse they suffered to a sympathetic and experienced forum.</P>
      <P LI="1">To establish as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of the physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and in other places during the period from 1940 to the present.</P>
      <P LI="1">To compile a report and publish it to the general public, on the activities and the findings of the Commission, containing recommendations on actions to address the continuing effects of the abuse and actions to be taken to safeguard children from abuse in the future.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The commission through its confidential committee provides a forum for victims of abuse to recount their experiences on an entirely confidential basis. The purpose of this committee is to meet the needs of those victims who want to speak of their experiences but who do not wish to become involved in an investigative procedure. This committee will provide the commission with a general report on the issues encountered in its work. The commission also has an investigation committee. This committee facilitates victims who wish to both recount their experiences and to have allegations of abuse inquired into. This committee will also report to the Commission. During 2002 my Department became concerned as to the apparent lack of progress by the investigation committee and, following a request for a virtual doubling of resources in June 2002, the Department began to explore with the com<Col N="57"/>mission the difficulties being encountered by that committee.</P>
      <P>Following much consideration the Government decided, on 3 December 2002, to engage in a process of reviewing the operations and remit of the commission and in particular the investigation committee.</P>
      <P>The intention behind the original legislation envisaged that the commission would proceed on an informal basis as far as possible. However, as the commission began its investigation process, this proved not to be possible and the hearing process became adversarial. This gave rise to the possibility of legal costs rising to a magnitude of &euro;150 million to &euro;200 million and if the work of the investigation committee were to continue in this format, it would take the commission an estimated eight to 11 years to complete its work. The age profile of many of the survivors was also borne in mind. Many people, including survivors, were justifiably concerned about this lengthy time frame. Accordingly, a review of the commission was carried out by the office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Following the resignation of Ms Justice Mary Laffoy as chairperson of the commission, the Government, on 26 September 2003, appointed Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, then senior counsel, as chairperson-designate of the commission. The Government requested Mr. Justice Ryan to immediately undertake his own independent review of the working of the commission. The terms of reference of the review were as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">To carry out a review of the working of the Commission and to make all necessary recommendations having regard to the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">a) The interests of the victims of abuse;</P>
      <P LI="2">b) The completion of the Commission&rsquo;s work within a reasonable period of time and in a manner consistent with a proper investigation; and</P>
      <P LI="2">c) To achieve the above objectives without incurring exorbitant costs.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report was published on 15 January 2004 together with the review completed by the office of the Attorney General. Mr. Justice Ryan concluded in his report that a combination of legislative amendments to the original Act and alternative procedures being adopted by the investigation committee would result in the commission being in a position to conclude its work within a reasonable timescale and without incurring exorbitant costs. The Government accepted Mr. Justice Ryan&rsquo;s report. Following publication of the report the investigation committee held meetings with all interested parties and representative groups, to facilitate them in expressing their views on the content of both reports and to enable them to make suggestions on the future operation of the investigation committee.</P>
      <P>Following that consultation process, on 7 May 2004 the investigation committee hosted an open meeting at which it presented a position paper <Col N="58"/>entitled Identifying Institutions and Persons under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, and a document entitled Background to Events Surrounding the Re-constitution of the Investigation Committee. This document set out proposals to enhance the workings of the committee. A formal hearing of the investigation committee took place on 24 May 2004 to receive submissions on the matter. Representative groups were also given an opportunity to express their views subsequent to the hearing. Following the conclusion of this process, Mr. Justice Sean Ryan, on 16 June 2004, stated that the commission had decided to proceed in accordance with the position paper published in May 2004.</P>
      <P>The confidential committee of the commission continues to operate as normal and by 19 April 2005 it had heard evidence from its 1,060th witness, leaving approximately 35 witnesses waiting to give evidence. The confidential committee will continue to hear evidence in the coming months from the remaining witnesses after which it will prepare its report and present it to the commission.</P>
      <P>The investigation committee has held a series of hearings into the emergence of child abuse. In this regard the Taoiseach, former Ministers for Education and Science, Deputies Martin and Woods, and officials of the Department have all given evidence to the committee regarding the background to the establishment of the commission. The aim of these public hearings was to establish on an historical basis how child abuse as an issue emerged in the State. The committee has also called witnesses from other State Departments, the religious congregations and the various survivor groups.</P>
      <P>In addition to the public hearings, the investigation committee has commenced its inquiries into specific institutions, commencing with St. Joseph&rsquo;s Clonmel, in September 2004. Hearings on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Industrial School, Upton took place in October 2004; on Our Lady of Succour Industrial School, Newtownforbes in January 2005; on St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Kilkenny in February 2005 and on St. Vincent&rsquo;s, Goldenbridge in March 2005.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Ryan in his programme for work for 2005 has said that the investigation committee will interview everyone &mdash; approximately 1,300 &mdash; who decided to continue participating in the inquiry by the investigation committee. This process has commenced and is being conducted by members of the commission&rsquo;s legal team. Information obtained in these interviews will be collected and produced in report format which will then be distributed, as appropriate, to the relevant bodies for comment and discussion. If there are material areas of dispute, the committee will arrange for further investigation, including full hearings if appropriate. In the interview process, witnesses whose experience is required to be investigated further by the committee will be chosen for later appearance before it in full <Col N="59"/>session with cross-examination taking place. While not all witnesses in the largest institutions will go to full adversarial hearing, everybody will be interviewed. Many will have both adversarial hearings and interviews.</P>
      <P>The scheme the commission is putting in place has several functions. The investigation committee will have an opportunity to gather a body of evidence at first hand from all people who want to continue with the committee, ensuring that every single person has a role in the work of the inquiry. It will enable the committee, through its legal team, to ensure witnesses put forward for participation in the formal hearing process represent the full range of experiences across time in a particular institution. It will reduce the likelihood of those less able for adversarial hearings being subjected to examination and cross-examination before gatherings of lawyers and other interested parties. It will yield information across institutions under investigation. This will be gathered in a formal process of interview to enable topics to be examined and comparisons between institutions will be made easier. The commission&rsquo;s 2005 investigation committee programme will include interviews with all witnesses, expert investigation and public and private hearings. It is the commission&rsquo;s intention to complete its report prior to the end of its extended remit of May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Bill will implement the main recommendation of both the Attorney General and Mr. <?oasys _dc8-?>Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan to remove the obligation on the investigation committee to conduct full hearings into each allegation of abuse made to it. Instead, the committee will be able to call witnesses to give evidence of abuse suffered by them, to the extent the investigation committee deems it necessary for the purposes of the inquiry. This key amendment is provided for in sections 4 and 7. Persons not called to give evidence to the investigation committee can opt to apply to transfer to the confidential committee of the commission. The Bill also removes the requirement for a two phase process whereby the commission would first have to determine whether abuse occurred before proceeding to consider the causes, nature, circumstances and extent of such abuse. This amendment, provided for under sections 4 and 5, will make the process more effective, less time consuming and less costly.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>Sections 4 and 7 extend the remit of the commission and the investigation committee to examine the manner in which children were placed in residential institutions and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident there. This is important to get a full understanding of how and why child abuse occurred and the historical and societal context in which it arose.</P>
      <P>Sections 5 and 8 respectively provide that the commission and the investigation committee will only name individual abusers who have a criminal conviction for child abuse or those who have admitted or pleaded guilty to charges of child <Col N="60"/>abuse. The primary purpose of the commission inquiry is to determine the causes, nature, circumstances and extent of child abuse. Given the rights of persons to due process, it is necessary to place certain limitations on the naming of individuals alleged to have carried out abuse. Several other changes proposed include a provision to allow for joint hearings to take place to allow complainants with a common alleged abuser to have their complaints heard simultaneously, provided for under section 6. Section 6 also provides for a division of the committee to operate under a single member of the commission.</P>
      <P>Section 8 enables the commission to issue fact-finding interim reports. Section 9 extends the powers of the commission to require persons giving evidence to it to swear the matter in an affidavit and make admissions to, and to answer written interrogatories, under oath so that matters can be dealt with more speedily and at less cost. Section 14 allows a complainant to withdraw a complaint being made subject to the consent of the committee.</P>
      <P>Part 3, sections 22 to 33, inclusive, and the Schedule provide for the establishment of an education finance board to administer an education grant scheme for former residents of institutions and their families. Amendments to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 are contained in Part 4. Under the terms of the indemnity agreement concluded with the religious congregations, a sum of &euro;12.7 million is to be used for educational programmes for former residents of institutions and their families. The agreement was concluded in June 2002 after the enactment of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. As the Act predated the agreement it was not possible to have any legislative provision for the operation of the &euro;12.7 million fund. In view of the urgency of making funding available to former residents wishing to undertake further education, a grant scheme funded by the Department of Education and Science was established on an administrative basis in September 2003, pending the introduction of a statutory scheme. This scheme is administered by the National Office for Victims of Abuse with the assistance of the City of Dublin VEC, with approximately &euro;1.4 million already spent on the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Bill establishes an independent education finance board to administer an educational grant scheme for former residents and their families. It also provides a legal basis for the management and investment of the &euro;12.7 million fund provided under the indemnity agreement for this purpose, after taking account of interest accruing on the &euro;12.7 million fund and expenditure incurred to date on the non-statutory scheme. Section 26 provides for the fund to be managed by the National Treasury Management Agency which will make an annual payment from the fund to the education finance board to meet the ongoing costs of the grant scheme. The principal functions of the board, set out in section 25, are to pay grants to former residents of institutions and their families, <Col N="61"/>to determine and publish the criteria by which it will make decisions on applications for grants and to make available to applicants information on the educational services for which grants are available.</P>
      <P>Section 29 provides for the board to consist of a chairperson and eight ordinary members. To ensure that survivors&rsquo; interests are adequately represented, four of the ordinary members will be former residents of institutions. Section 31 provides for the board&rsquo;s annual audited accounts to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas while section 32 provides for the publication of an annual report on the board&rsquo;s activities. The Schedule deals with the membership, meetings and procedures of the board.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments to the Residential Institutions Redress Act are mainly of a technical nature and have been requested by the redress board and the review committee in light of their experience of the redress application process over the past two years. Established on 16 December 2002 under the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, the board&rsquo;s primary function is to make fair and reasonable awards to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories and other institutions, subject to State regulation or inspection. The redress scheme provides an alternative to survivors having to pursue traumatic civil court cases to obtain compensation for their injuries. While the civil courts operate on the basis that a plaintiff must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt, the redress board operates on a generally lower threshold of proof and does not make a finding of guilt of an individual or an institution. The board, which is wholly independent, is chaired by Mr. Justice Sean O&rsquo;Leary and has nine ordinary members.</P>
      <P>This legislation was enacted for the many people who as children were committed by the courts to industrial and reformatory schools and who suffered abuse while resident there. In addition to children committed by the courts, significant numbers were also committed to industrial and reformatory schools by parents and the schools often operated as orphanages. The redress scheme is designed to address how the State and the institutions concerned failed while having responsibility for the care of the child. It acknowledges that because of this, some people who were in institutional care have, through much of their lives, carried serious psychological scars. The scheme seeks to provide reasonable financial compensation for that injury. The Act provides that where a person makes an application for an award to the board, he or she is required to establish proof of identity that he or she was resident in an institution during his or her childhood, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.</P>
      <P>The board commenced operations in December 2002 and, according to the latest infor<Col N="62"/>mation available, it has received more than 5,900 applications to date and has made awards in more than 3,000 cases. The average award made by the board is &euro;78,000 and total payments to date amount to some &euro;229 million. The amount of award payable in each case will depend on the severity of the abuse and the severity of physical and psychological injury as well as loss of opportunity resulting from the abuse. The board may grant awards up to &euro;300,000 and in exceptionally severe cases it may award an amount higher than this. There is also provision to award additional aggravated damages of up to &euro;60,000 in certain specified circumstances.</P>
      <P>Originally, 128 institutions were listed on the Schedule of the Act and section 4 of the Act allows the Minister for Education and Science to make an order for the inclusion of additional institutions. In November 2004, I signed an order allowing for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions. It is possible that a further small number of institutions may be added to the Schedule in the near future as a result of the inquiries still being conducted by my Department.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendments to the redress Act are contained in section 34 and include allowing for a two week cooling off period once an applicant has made a request to the review committee for it to review an award offered by the redress board. Survivor groups requested this change and the chairperson of the review committee agrees with it. The proposed amendments also include allowing the Courts Service to administer arrangements for the payment of awards in instalments &mdash; the Courts Service has confirmed that it is willing to do so but cannot until a legislative basis is provided and providing that anyone who gives false information to the board may be liable for prosecution for perjury &mdash; currently, only applicants to the board can be so prosecuted.</P>
      <P>The amending legislation before the D&aacute;il today fulfils three important functions. First, it will greatly assist the commission in completing a comprehensive inquiry into child abuse within a sensible timeframe and at an affordable cost. Second, it sets up an independent statutory scheme of educational support for survivors and their families. Third, it makes a number of legislative amendments to enhance the effective operation of the redress scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The Minister said it will greatly assist the commission in completing a comprehensive inquiry into child abuse within a sensible time frame and at an affordable cost. While I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments, it should be clarified that while justice should be delivered in the most timely and effective manner, the priority must be that it is delivered.</P>
      <P>When Ms Justice Laffoy resigned from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse in September 2003, the work of the commission and its relationship with the Government was brought <Col N="63"/>under the spotlight. What was uncovered exposed the Government to valid criticism as to how it had failed to support Ms Justice Laffoy in her approach to the investigation of abuse and how persistent mishandling of the situation led directly to her resignation. In fact, the Government approach to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse led Ms Justice Laffoy to write that since its establishment &ldquo;the Commission has never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas&rdquo;. This was a damning indictment of a Government that on one hand established the commission to investigate the most dreadful case of mass abuse to occur in the history of the State and, on the other hand, failed to give the same commission the support it needed to carry out its functions.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to rehearse the significant failings of the Government at that time but it is important that some of the most serious failings are noted. Ms Justice Laffoy listed the ways in which the Government thwarted the work of the commission: compensation for the survivors of abuse was raised in July 2000 but was not dealt with until 2002; the issue of the payment of legal costs of persons involved in the process of the investigation committee was also raised in July 2000 but was not dealt with until 2002; the decision to review the commission&rsquo;s mandate, which effectively stalled the work of the commission, and the slow and contradictory way in which commission requests for additional resources were handled.</P>
      <P>These issues were clearly matters for the Government to resolve but the delay in dealing with requests from the commission and the often contradictory responses that Ms Justice Laffoy received regarding requests for assistance frustrated the work of the commission and led to her resignation. As I said previously, there is a conflict of interest in the Department of Education and Science sponsoring an inquiry when the Department is part of what is being investigated. That is a mistake and it is a pity the opportunity to rectify it in this legislation was not taken.</P>
      <P>The actions of the Government stymied the work of the commission and delayed proceedings that are vital to the search for truth, acceptance and healing that so many victims of past abuse seek. I sincerely hope Mr. Justice Ryan is receiving the co-operation and assistance he needs from Government to conduct this important work. We must now ensure that we enable the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to work for all victims of abuse.</P>
      <P>From the moment the Taoiseach made his apology to the victims of child abuse in 1999, the victims expected that they would have access to the commission and that their stories would be heard. Following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the appointment of Mr. Justice Ryan to the commission, a detailed report on the commission was published in January 2004. In his report, Mr. Justice Ryan outlined the difficulties <Col N="64"/>that have faced the commission, in particular the problems associated with the work of the investigation committee. Mr. Justice Ryan made a clear statement with regard to the issue of &ldquo;sampling&rdquo;, the random selection of cases to proceed to inquiry, when he stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">While there was a readiness all round to acknowledge the problems facing the Investigation Committee, the idea of &ldquo;sampling&rdquo; the cases was seen as an unacceptable attenuation of the entitlements of victims of abuse to bring their experiences to the Commission via the Committee of choice. And it has to be accepted that this proposal would indeed have deprived a large number of complainants of the opportunity to participate directly in the inquiry process.</P>
      <P FLI="0">However, Mr. Justice Ryan also stated in his report that he believed the commission should have a wider discretion regarding which cases go to a full hearing and stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The [Investigation] Committee requires a capacity to come to a conclusion in respect of a particular complainant that it would be impracticable or unfair or unreasonable to put him or her to the ordeal of being examined and cross examined in respect of allegations that were of such a nature as to be unlikely ever to be able to ground a finding of abuse. This is naturally a sensitive and difficult issue.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Certainly, this issue is one that has caused most considerable debate and concern among the victims of abuse in recent years. It as of paramount importance that the commission on child abuse is statutorily empowered to fulfil its vital remit but it must also be of real assistance and benefit to each victim who seeks access to it.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of this legislation that are welcome but there are also aspects that cause concern. I welcome the broadening of the definition of abuse that now includes not only the result of abuse but also includes what &ldquo;could be expected to result&rdquo;. This is a change that eases somewhat the burden on the victim and acknowledges, whether intentionally or not, that different people are affected in different ways.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005, amends the Act of 2000, removing the obligation on the investigation committee to hear all complainants and gives it discretion as to which witnesses it considers should be called to a full hearing. However, in balance to this change in legislation, the commission will meet all victims and conduct interviews with each one before making a decision as to the cases that should progress to full inquiry. Mr. Justice Ryan, in his report of January 2004, was clear that he was not suggesting that the category of complainants whose allegations of abuse would not proceed to full inquiry would be large in number. This point is of some concern. Obviously, the amending legislation being discussed cannot indicate the number of <Col N="65"/>cases that might not proceed to inquiry. However, it is important to insist that if this legislation is passed, and discretion is given to the child abuse commission, it would only be applied in cases where the intention was to use it, in the January 2004 report.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Ryan, wrote to the 1,712 outstanding complainants, asking them whether they wished to proceed with their complaint. We would have a better idea of what we are dealing with here if we were told how many have replied to say that they are continuing. It would allow us to debate this issue with a clear grasp of the level of complaint. When Fine Gael contacted the commission, it informed us that it is not making this information available but that replies are still being received. It is a pity we cannot have this information. I will examine this section in detail and consider the best way forward for the victims of child abuse before Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 5 represents a sea change from the original Act of 2000. The alleged abuser will now only be identified if he or she has been found guilty of an offence in respect of the abuse. I can only assume the reason for this is to speed matters up and that it will mean the abuser will not have to be afforded legal representation. However, I would like to hear further explanations from the Minister on this issue as it represents a considerable turnaround which is difficult for victims to accept.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Section 6 appears to allow for the opportunity of meetings being held in public, but I would like to see greater clarity on what will guide the commission in reaching its decision on this issue. I endorse the opportunity being given to the commission by this Bill to act in divisions, which is broadly similar to the last Act. The difference is in allowing the divisions to consist of only one member rather than members. While the previous commission technically had this power, resources and the awaiting of responses from the Department of Education and Science for clarifications and commitments in this area effectively rendered this power useless. The commission can only work with the resources allocated to it by the Department, which to date has shown a spectacular disregard for the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>A sweeping change is proposed in section 7. Up until now, the function of the commission was to provide &ldquo;for persons who have suffered abuse in childhood in institutions during the relevant period, an opportunity to recount the abuse and make submissions to the Committee&rdquo;. Under this proposed legislation we are:</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">to provide, as far as is reasonably practicable, for persons who have suffered abuse in childhood in institutions during the relevant period, an opportunity to recount the abuse and other relevant experiences undergone by them in institutions.</P><Col N="66"/>
      <P FLI="0">What does the legislation mean by &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo;? No definition is offered to enlighten us further and I ask the Minister for clarification on this point. If people are asked to accept such a change, which runs contrary to all their expectations, they are at least entitled to know how the commission will be guided on this.</P>
      <P>Proceeding with the work of the commission and reaching conclusions on this shameful aspect of our national history is in the interest of the victims of child abuse and of society. We have a responsibility to ensure the dreadful occurrences of the past cannot happen again. A large part of our response must focus on the need to hear for ourselves about the ill treatment meted out to vulnerable children in the past. When she dealt with the issue of residential institutions redress boards, I was disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity to consider the issue of children who were abused in regular day schools. People such as those involved in the Donal Dunne case have always been refused the opportunity of appearing before the redress board. The argument used was that the State was not <i>in loco parentis</i> to those children, which I find difficult to accept. These people may lose their opportunity, under the proposed changes, to have their voice heard.</P>
      <P>As there is no redress board, the only opportunity these people would have to get their story told is through the child abuse commission. There have been court cases, and the abuser in this instance was prosecuted. However, there is an issue surrounding the responsibility of the Department and health board officials who should have known what was going on but failed to take action. There is a great degree of concern among the victims that they will not get the opportunity to have their story told. That brings me back to my point about the conflict of interest in having the Department of Education and Science as a sponsoring Department and under investigation at the same time. I would be concerned if there was a feeling that these people were being denied that opportunity.</P>
      <P>We often feel that we have only become aware of the abuse in the 1990s. However, in 1957, the ISPCC recorded cases of assault, incest and neglect while the Tuarim report was published in 1966. The commission of inquiry on mental illness was carried out in 1966 and recommended that the problem of industrial schools should be examined. The Kennedy report in 1970 was described by Mary Raftery as one of the most damning indictments of the operation of any State system ever recorded in this country. Unfortunately, it appears the documents gathered for this report were lost. In that same year, Donal Dunne arrived in a school in County Offaly and evidence of his abuse became apparent after three years. He was sacked by the parish priest but was provided with a glowing reference after which he served in six or seven more schools. Instances like that must be investigated by the commission <Col N="67"/>because it is not just the abuser who bears responsibility &mdash; the State does so as well.</P>
      <P>According to the third interim report of the commission in 2003, there were 165 complainants from primary and secondary schools, but 93% of these could not be called because there was only one allegation made against 135 individual abusers. That means that only 7% of those who claim to have been abused in those schools are allowed to come before the commission. There are obvious concerns that this 7% would be diluted further. I welcome the fact that section 17 of this legislation, in amending section 25 of the principal Act, now gives discretion to the High Court, rather than to the commission, to decide on whether court directions on the performance of its functions should be held in public.</P>
      <P>Provision in the legislation for the establishment of an education finance board for the former residents of children&rsquo;s institutions also represents an important development. For those denied the type of support and education that is now taken for granted in most families, this support is overdue. The composition of the board will be one chairperson and eight ordinary members, four of whom must be former residents of institutions. All are to be appointed by the Minister for Education and Science. I would appreciate further clarity on the manner in which these people will be appointed, and how the former residents of institutions will be selected. It is important that people from different institutions, with different experiences, have the opportunity to serve on this board. I must question the delay of one year for the establishment of this section of the Act. Justice has been delayed and denied long enough for those involved. I appreciate the necessity to establish a board, but there is no reason that these preparations cannot be made now.</P>
      <P>As it is not clear from section 30 of the Act, the Minister should clarify whether the cost of running the board will be borne out of the &euro;12.7 million granted to it. Section 30 allows the Minister for Finance discretion on the number of employees on the board. There was a clear impression among those involved that the money would be ring-fenced for them and not spent on administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The fact we have not debated this until April 2005 is an abysmal indication of the record of the Government in dealing with this issue. We all welcomed the apology by the Taoiseach in 1999, which was given on behalf of the people. It was long overdue to those children who suffered terribly in the care of the State and directly in the care of a number of religious institutions as well. After that apology, there was a hope that things would happen quickly for the survivors. In 2000, the original legislation which set up the commission gave the hope that survivors would have the opportunity to tell their <Col N="68"/>story and that the State and others would take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the timeframe in between is very long. It is not as if that was not brought to the attention of the Government. Ms Justice Laffoy, who was the chairperson of the original commission, told the Government on a number of occasions exactly what was wrong. Yet it has taken until now for us to get some answers. She pointed out many of the issues that were subsequently pointed out by Mr. Justice Ryan and are incorporated in the legislation before us. She was ignored by the Government to such an extent that she resigned from the post in frustration. It became obvious that the number of people who wanted to tell their story was more than 1,700 and the legislation entitled the people to a full hearing. It was then clear that unless some of her recommendations were taken on board, it would take 11 years or more to deal with the whole issue. It was quite clear that could not happen because of the age of many of the people who had suffered abuse and who were accused of perpetrating abuse.</P>
      <P>From 2000, Ms Justice Laffoy made clear there was a need to take action to make the commission work. Everybody wanted to make the commission work and obviously the purpose of the commission was to give hearing, redress and closure to survivors of abuse, but there was an absolute failure on the part of the Government to deal with that issue, particularly when Ms Justice Laffoy was in charge of the commission. It was not that she did not make it clear. She did on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>Ms Justice Laffoy also expressed serious reservations about the involvement of the Department of Education and Science and its failure to comply with requests for information from the commission. I too want to hear from the Department through the Minister whether eventually all those requests to which Ms Justice Laffoy referred were complied with. At the time we expressed reservations about the fact that the Department of Education and Science was still the lead Department and I still have those concerns. As the Department is inextricably linked up with this issue, admittedly in the past and not in the present, it is still wrong that it should be the Department in effective control of the legislation.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to briefly go through the evolution of events to this point. Ms Justice Laffoy stated early on that those who suffered abuse and those accused of perpetrating it deserve &ldquo;to see the inquiry, which they were promised over four years ago, concluded within a reasonable time frame&rdquo;. In a statement she delivered at the first public sitting of the commission held on 29 June 2000, Ms Justice Laffoy stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Commission, through its Committees, will hear all persons who come forward to tell of abuse they have suffered in institutions in childhood. No such person will be refused a hearing.</P><Col N="69"/>
      <P FLI="0">The task of the investigation committee was to investigate child abuse alleged to have taken place in more than 100 institutions in respect of some 1,712 complainants over a period of 60 years. Many, if not most, of the complainants name or identify multiple alleged abusers, sometimes in different institutions. The oldest victim was born in 1926. Those accused of abuse are older than the complainants and some of them are dead, some left their congregations many years ago and some have not been traced. Those who are alive and traced include persons who are confused or not in a condition to defend themselves. These features partly explain the difficulty and complexity of the work to be done and make the investigation committee&rsquo;s functions probably the most challenging ever to have been the subject of an Irish public inquiry.</P>
      <P>Most of the complainants were in industrial or reformatory schools and accuse more than one person of abuse. On analysis of the figures it appears that the vast majority of complaints are in respect of a relatively small number of institutions and individuals. Of the 1,712 complainants, 1,312 made complaints in respect of 20 institutions.</P>
      <P>Complaints were made against 1,195 alleged individual abusers. The total number of complaints made against those individual respondents is 4,128. The overall number of complaints against individual respondents in respect of the 20 institutions giving rise to the largest number of complaints was 3,192, which is 77% of all complaints against individual respondents. That gives an idea of the size of the issue.</P>
      <P>Early on, Ms Justice Laffoy stated that the only way to deal with this effectively was to have parallel hearings and that she needed the resources the carry out those. The resources were never given to her. Therefore she could not effect the speedy addressing of the issue as she wished and she eventually ended up resigning.</P>
      <P>Following Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s resignation, Mr. Justice Ryan made his first report in January 2004. At that time, he made recommendations which in many ways are largely similar to what is contained in this legislation. It is now April 2005. People who have suffered greatly and who need the opportunity to tell their story that was to be given by the commission are still waiting in most cases.</P>
      <P>I looked up some of my queries on this matter. A response to Questions Nos. 39, 55 and 113 on 18 May 2004 told me the Government was awaiting the decision of the Christian Brothers&rsquo; case. The reply stated: &ldquo;Consequently, it is not envisaged that amending legislation can be published before September 2004.&rdquo; This is April 2005 and we are only dealing with the legislation.</P>
      <P>We need to be cognisant that we are dealing with people who had great hope of having their issues addressed in 1999 and have had that hope dashed repeatedly. It is no accident that they are not in the Visitors Gallery today. A number of survivors&rsquo; groups lobbied all of us regularly in the <Col N="70"/>past but few of them are here today. While I do not know about the representations made to the other Members present in the Chamber, I certainly did not receive many representations on this legislation. It is not that people are unconcerned but that they have been worn down by the timeframe. They feel that if they do not accept what is contained in the legislation, they are unlikely to get another opportunity to change this. Obviously on Committee State we will try to change it in whatever way the survivors wish. It is significant. It is because people are tired and want to get on with it. They will accept now what, in effect, is a form of sampling in this legislation and I would ask the Minister to respond on this. It involves at least a withdrawal of control from the survivors to the commission in a way the original commission was not constructed.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister stated in her speech that the numbers have reduced to about 1,300, from more than 1,700. I assume that is because some decided they no longer wanted to go before the investigative committee. I should stress that at all times we are talking about the investigative committee in the case of difficulties. What has happened to those 400 people? Is it because they have had to wait so long? Is it because some of them have passed away or may be too infirm to go before the commission?</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the changes. She stated that everybody will have the opportunity to be heard but not everybody will go to full hearing. Certainly the original intention was that people would have the opportunity to tell their full story. The Minister said that if there are material areas of dispute, the committee will arrange for further investigation, including full hearings if appropriate. Later in her speech she suggested, as I understand it, that the commission will decide who will go to full hearing and who will not. That is clearly a transfer of power from the survivors as individuals to the commission as a body and that is to be regretted.</P>
      <P>I can understand why there has been a need to speed up the process and why many of the changes are being made. Dealing with one institution at a time, for instance, is sensible and I support it fully. It makes great sense to deal with a particular institution and bring in everybody who was involved in that institution. Dividing up into decades is another good suggestion, in other words, that if allegations of abuse over three decades are made against an institution, one would deal with one decade at a time and that if somebody&rsquo;s involvement overlapped between one decade and the next, one would deal with the decade in which the person spent the most time there. All of these are practical and sensible. The parallel hearings by another name, with the individual member of the commission in each one, are a good proposal as well. All those proposals are sensible. Some of these were put forward by Ms Justice Laffoy and could have been acted upon at that time.</P><Col N="71"/>
      <P>I have doubts about the proposal that people would not get the opportunity for a full hearing. Can people appeal that? People might strongly wish to tell their full stories, but the commission might decide their stories have been told by someone else. The commission may have good reason to think a person does not need to go to full hearing, but one of the fundamental undertakings given to survivors was that they would have the opportunity to tell their stories. I would like clarification on that.</P>
      <P>I would also like clarification regarding section 6 and the issue of jointly taking the evidence of a number of survivors. Issues of confidentiality would arise. Will people be asked to give their permission before being expected to tell their stories with other people present?</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the requirement for discovery of documents, which refers back to the issue of the involvement by the Department of Education and Science. I assume that would apply to that Department as well. That too might be clarified.</P>
      <P>I have serious concerns about the sampling issue. The survivor groups made it clear they were strongly opposed to sampling. While the Minister says every person will have some opportunity to tell his or her story, I would like to know the extent of the opportunity to be afforded those not selected to go to full hearing. How much information will they be able to give?</P>
      <P>I welcome that there will be more public hearings and, I hope, more public information. This possibly applies more to the redress board than to the commission, but there is a feeling of frustration among many survivors that they cannot talk about their experiences before the two bodies. This was exemplified by the protest outside Leinster House last year. People experience this frustration, particularly with regard to the redress board, but the dealings must be confidential. However, we need more public information on issues such as people&rsquo;s level of satisfaction with the awards given through the board.</P>
      <P>While I am speaking about the redress board, I will refer to the part of the legislation which deals with that. There is also the question of adding other institutions to the list, as raised by Deputy Enright. I too have contacted the Minister about certain institutions which have not been included and I hope the Minister can bring forward a further list. I know that some institutions would not necessarily be run by any of the religious bodies listed in the indemnity deal, but I hope that will not exclude them from being listed as being eligible to go before the redress board. Some of them would have been hospital-type institutions containing people who were ill but who were in effect in institutional care. I understand the Minister is examining those as well. There is a need to add to the list. The situation referred to by Deputy Enright must also be examined. I know the argument is that those in day schools could go home to their parents at <Col N="72"/>night and that people in residential institutions needed more protection from the State, but perhaps later, in a separate phase, the issue of day schools could be addressed.</P>
      <P>I want to say a little about the education services and the section of the legislation which deals with setting up a board to provide for the education fund. The money appears to relate to the money provided for in the indemnity deal. If people were not in those institutions and if the other institutions were added on, would those people still be able to qualify for the education fund? I had some representations about the education fund as it was been working before this legislation. Some people felt it was not sufficiently flexible, that one could get only assistance with education if one were pursuing that education inside certain boundaries, and that it would otherwise be refused. Will the Minister make the administration of the fund as flexible as possible and allow for some form of appeals system whereby people refused educational funding could make a case? In many cases, survivors of abuse have missed out on educational opportunities and we must respond to their needs as broadly as possible.</P>
      <P>The board comprises a chairperson and eight ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Education and Science. Four of the members must be former residents of institutions. Will the Minister select those former residents or will the survivor groups have a role in selection? I am conscious there are different groups, so when one is selecting just four people, it is difficult to represent the different voices. Those different voices must be acknowledged. People have different slants on the matter and take different approaches. As far as possible, all the different voices should be heard with regard to the board and the issue in general.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and by and large I welcome the intention that it will streamline the system and allow survivors of abuse to tell their stories to those directly involved. However, I have serious reservations about the fact that not all survivors will be able to tell their full stories if they want to. I say that conscious that there are time limits and a need to ensure that people get the opportunity for closure on the issue in an appropriate timeframe.</P>
      <P>We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to address other issues regarding the detail of the legislation. I welcome that we are finally dealing with this issue though I regret we did not do so many years ago. There is no justification for the Government taking so long in bringing this legislation before the House, nor is there any justification for the fact that when Ms Justice Laffoy was in charge of the commission, her complaints and recommendations, when brought to the attention of the Government, received no real response. However, I welcome that we have finally reached this stage. My party will try to ensure the legislation goes through the Oireachtas as speedily as possible.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="73"/>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Gogarty and Crowe. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation. As the Minister said, the background to this legislation and to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 is the reality of serious child abuse having taken place in homes and institutions funded by the State and, in effect, to a large extent run by it. In 1999, we all welcomed the apology on behalf of all of us by the Taoiseach for what had taken place during those years and the scale of abuse which residents had to endure over a long period.</P>
      <P>Like others, I am concerned the process is so slow. It is sad that even if we start with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology in 1999, the process will not be complete until at least 2008. The Minister said in her speech that it is the intention of the commission to report before May 2008, a timespan of nine years. On an issue such as this where victims need closure and to put these difficulties behind them, a timespan in that range is too long by half.</P>
      <P>I hope this legislation goes through the Oireachtas speedily and that the necessary amendments will be made. When dealing with the previous legislation I expressed my concern about the Department of Education and Science as the sponsoring Department for this legislation because of the serious conflict of interest with its involvement. There is no doubt that the role of the Department in funding, managing and running some of these homes and institutions gives rise to a conflict of interest as has been indicated by the difficulties in getting information and files from the Department over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>I am aware survivor groups have looked at and are concerned by this legislation. They have indicated a number of amendments they would like to see made. They have requested a meeting with the Minister and I have been asked to reiterate that request. I hope the Minister will meet representatives of the survivor groups as requested and that she will take on board some, if not all, of their amendments.</P>
      <P>There are welcome aspects to this legislation, one of which is the extension of the definition of abuse. It will now be open to the commission &ldquo;to make a finding of abuse where it might be reasonable to assume that acts or omissions concerned caused serious harm to the person&rdquo;. I welcome that provision and also the provision under sections 27 and 28 of the principal Act whereby information coming to the commission or its committees required to be forwarded to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been amended so that any information which would lead to a serious offence carrying a period of imprisonment of at least one year must be brought to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Previously only offences that carried a five year sentence had to be reported to the Garda. This is a welcome change.</P>
      <P>Survivors of abuse have serious concerns with regard to section 4 of the Bill which changes:</P><Col N="74"/>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">the functions of the Commission in a number of respects. It extends the functions to include a duty on the Commission to inquire into the manner in which children were placed in institutions and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident there.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The survivors would like to see significant amendments to this section. They feel the wording is too vague. It should be more specific, particularly following the public statements by Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan in May 2004. He said: &ldquo;The Commission ought to examine the &lsquo;role of the Courts&rsquo; in placing children in the institutions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The survivors also feel the wording &ldquo;to inquire into the manner in which children were placed&rdquo; in these institutions is no improvement and does not meet the assurances given by the former Minister, Deputy Woods, in the D&aacute;il in April 2000. In addition the wording &ldquo;the circumstances in which they continued to be resident&rdquo; could mean anything and is, therefore, meaningless. It does not amount to the assurances given that the role of the Executive in keeping children detained against the wishes of parents would be examined. It must be appreciated that the Minister exercised statutory powers under various Children Acts and there is evidence of improper use of those powers. Therefore, to allay fears and give full expression to undertakings already given, section 4 should be amended and changed leaving no room for doubt that the commission intends to investigate the role of the courts and the Executive arm of Government which exercised statutory powers. The survivors want to see the role of the courts in placing children in these institutions and the role of the Department and the Government in that process investigated thoroughly. They feel Mr. Justice Se&aacute;n Ryan&rsquo;s stated aim to examine the role of the courts justifies the amendment they propose in this regard.</P>
      <P>Survivors of abuse also have difficulty with section 22 which deals with the Education Finance Board. They want the substitution of the term &ldquo;relative&rdquo; by the word &ldquo;families&rdquo;. The &euro;12.7 million contribution from CORI envisaged financial assistance to survivors and their &ldquo;families&rdquo;. Survivors believe the use of the word &ldquo;relative&rdquo; in the Bill is too wide and that in view of its interpretation within the amendment proposals, it will create criteria that will allow persons who were never in an institution, or even in Ireland, to make grant applications to the board on the same basis as those who spent years in industrial schools and suffered educational deprivation arising from that. The integrity of the fund should be protected and parties not originally envisaged by the CORI contributors or who are not blood issue or legally adopted children of survivors should not be invited to participate in the process.</P>
      <P>Survivors want the Bill to make clear in section 25 what is meant by &ldquo;educational services&rdquo;. This should not be left for interpretation by others at a later date. Section 27(3) states: &ldquo;The [finance] Board shall determine the criteria&rdquo; for the fund. <Col N="75"/>Survivors believe this should be done by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Section 29(2) provides that four of the members of the board shall be persons who are each former residents of the institutions. This should include a reference that such persons should sign a conflict of interest protocol and resign from any body or organisation connected with these matters to which such person belongs.</P>
      <P>While I welcome this Bill, significant amendments are required if it is to meet the views of those centrally involved, namely the survivors of child abuse. I hope the Minister will take into consideration the amendments suggested by these groups and that she will agree to meet their representatives at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the legislation, which I look forward to going through in great detail on Committee Stage. It has been a long time coming and I am a little apprehensive about what will happen on Committee Stage because the Government has a majority. I ask the Minister to take on board the concerns that will be expressed.</P>
      <P>It is a long time since the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy. At the time, I described her final report as a damning critique of the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s ability to adequately deal with child abuse. It is a sensitive issue and many survivors want to air their stories in public. They want proper recognition of the pain and torture they suffered whether that is through financial compensation or airing their stories publicly. I concur with previous speakers that the issue should be taken out of the hands of the Department of Education and Science and transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach, even if additional resources are required to implement the legislation. Many survivors have outlined their lack of faith in the Department of Education and Science. Many good people work in the Department and we have an excellent new Minister but, at the same time, they cannot be expected to look into their own dirt effectively. There will always be a cover-up and in the interest of transparency, responsibility for the commission should be taken from the Department once and for all.</P>
      <P>My main problem with the legislation is that many survivors will not be called to give evidence. While survivors welcome the financial provisions, more of them want more than anything else to get their stories out in public and they should be given the opportunity to do so. In addition, many complainants will not have an opportunity to be heard in court because of the delays in that system. They are being asked to accept that the commission will not make findings regarding whether individuals abused people, but that is what they want. There are legal implications to findings that individuals committed abuse but victims seek a definitive conclusion based on the evidence presented. Placing restric<Col N="76"/>tions on the number of witnesses or the extent of the evidence that can be heard will not uncover the entire story.</P>
      <P>Sampling is a controversial issue and it has not worked. For example, the third interim report of the commission in December 2003 outlined that there were 165 complainants from primary and secondary schools, 93% of whom could not be called because only one allegation was made against each of 135 individuals. This means 7% could have been called but a sample would have been taken. Sampling will not uncover the entire story because isolated incidents may come to light during the hearings that people may have suppressed for many years because they did not consider them important. However, they will only emerge during the telling of the story by the survivors.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated the intention of the commission is to uncover the truth about what happened. However, we know what happened. I said in 2003 that people were raped, buggered and abused in many ways. I will not go into graphic detail but I said during the previous debate that history would judge the Government and religious unkindly when the truth finally emerged. The overwhelming anecdotal evidence is that countless people were abused and the organs of the State and individuals were complicit in this. The Taoiseach&rsquo;s apology went some way to owning up to that but not as far as many survivors would like.</P>
      <P>The onus on us is not to go through an arty farty &ldquo;let us save a few million quid here to get the general truth out&rdquo; scenario. That would be disingenuous to the survivors. They want their version of the truth to come out and they want history to decide on the basis of individual testimonies. They do not want the commission to reach a sampled conclusion that may be generally correct. We can generally correctly say now that abuse happened and the State was complicit in this regard but we need to get the specifics out into the open.</P>
      <P>While I will go through the detail of the legislation on Committee Stage, I refer to a number of my concerns. I welcome section 3 but I have a number of queries about section 4. Sections 5 and 6 provide for speeding up the commission&rsquo;s work without getting all the truth out. I welcome a number of sections, including sections 10 and 11. However, I do not like the use of the term &ldquo;as far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo; in section 7, which amends section 12 of the principal Act. That is open to interpretation and it needs to be tightened on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Part 3 deals with the finance board. Section 27 permits the board to pay grants to former residents of institutions or their relatives to avail of educational services. I would like the legislation to outline the services that will be provided. I also share Deputy Healy&rsquo;s concerns about section 29. While I welcome that four board members must be former residents of institutions, a conflict of interest may arise and this should be addressed <Col N="77"/>as we move through the various Stages. I welcome the miscellaneous provisions in Part 4 and I look forward to going through the legislation on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>None of us is approaching this issue in a vacuum because we all know survivors of abuse and we have listened to their stories. They have described how they were hurt, scared, lost, damaged, frustrated and how they felt inadequate, angry and let down. A number talked about a black hole or dark room to which the door was closed in their lives. Many victims feel let down because there was great expectation when the process commenced but the longer it went on, the more frustrated many of them became. The legislation intends to speed up the process and save money. Nobody wants the ambulance chasers to make additional millions out of people&rsquo;s suffering and we are all approaching the legislation on the basis that it should improve the process.</P>
      <P>When speaking to a victim of child abuse, his or her need to tell people what happened to him or her is most striking. People often live a great part of their lives without being able to do so. That is why it is important a mechanism should be provided whereby they can tell their stories. That is how people will judge the legislation and that is why the establishment of official inquiries into these matters is important. I welcome the changes in the Bill that will improve the effectiveness of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. I am mindful, of course, that the impetus behind this Bill has come from the valid criticism made of the manner in which the commission had operated since its inception in 2000, or to be more exact criticism made of its lack of real powers. While much of the criticism that slowly emerged came from victims of abuse who were frustrated at the slow manner in which the process of inquiry was proceeding and what they saw as the lack of real power to tackle and punish institutional offenders, the most powerful criticism came from within the commission itself, from its former chairperson, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, who resigned in September 2003.</P>
      <P>Ms Justice Laffoy&rsquo;s critique focused on the issues of compensation for victims, legal costs, adequate funding to enable the commission to carry out its work and the slowness of the Government in completing a review of the work of the commission and providing the additional resources contingent on the review&rsquo;s completion. It is apparent, however, that there was an enormous amount of anger regarding the last-minute decision of former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, to indemnify the religious orders in the matter of cost. When the deal emerged, it was obvious that the greater burden would fall on the State, funded by the Irish taxpayer. That was one factor behind the lack of resources and the slowness of the process referred to by Ms Justice Laffoy. It is, therefore, worth restating that the religious orders in charge <Col N="78"/>of those institutions where abuse took place ought to have borne the cost of compensation for victims and the actual costs of the inquiry itself.</P>
      <P>The review referred to by Ms Justice Laffoy has since been completed and this Bill is designed to implement its recommendations so we will have to monitor it closely and judge how effective it will be in helping the commission complete its substantial body of work. One of the key findings of the third interim report was that while the commission was appreciative of the efforts made by officials in the Department of Education and Science, it was still ultimately responsible for the majority of the institutions in which abuse took place and the commission felt that there had been a failure to ensure that it could comply with its statutory obligations in the process of investigation.</P>
      <P>While the provisions in Part 3 of the Bill to establish a fund to assist victims financially in accessing education are very much to be welcomed, it is to be hoped that the Department of Education and Science will address the concerns expressed in the report in making its budgetary allocations and the Government as a whole will ensure that the necessary extra funds are made available from the central fund.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Bill itself, the amendment contained in section 3 to change the definition of abuse is welcome. It is designed to broaden the definition so that not only the direct perpetrators of abuse can be made answerable but also that persons or institutions who through carelessness, complicity or incompetence put a child at risk can also be brought to book. That is most important because we are all aware by now that we are not talking about a small number of dangerous individuals who acted in secret but people who felt that they were in some way insulated or protected by the institutions in which they operated. They were also given protection by a culture permeating certain structures of Irish society that viewed children from certain backgrounds as unworthy of their protection.</P>
      <P>The investigation of that aspect of the investigation will also be facilitated by the extension of the powers of the commission to inquire into why children were sent to and kept detained in institutions where they were abused. Above all, we must find out how the State allowed that abuse to take place and put in place mechanisms to ensure that such a situation is never allowed to happen again. It is not sufficient to find out what took place in the past; we must create structures that will ensure that it is never repeated.</P>
      <P>I referred to the need that people feel to tell what happened to them in the institutions in which they were held. That has been recognised as an important part of the therapeutic recovery of victims, who have often come to be able to talk about what happened to them only many years later. Many of them were also abused in circumstances in which they felt no one cared what happened to them and that no one would believe them if they brought themselves to tell. Unfortu<Col N="79"/>nately, that has been proven in all too many cases. That is why the amendments contained in sections 6 and 7 are welcome, allowing as they do greater scope for victims, either individually or as part of a group, to give their testimony, in certain cases in public.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the plight of those children abused in day care. I appreciate that the Act is being amended here, and the commission that it established is specifically designed to investigate cases of abuse in residential institutions. However, it is clear that there are significant numbers of people who were victims while attending educational or care institutions during the day. Sometimes they were in institutions where the abuse of residents took place, and in some cases, no doubt, the perpetrators were the same individuals. I ask that the situation of those victims be addressed. The Minister has argued that the State had different levels of responsibility, but no one can deny that many of those people are victims. They do not have the money to go through the courts and many of them want to be allowed to tell their stories.</P>
      <P>We are still left with the sense that people who have been abused are frustrated at the manner in which they were treated or critical of how the commission has operated to date. We must avoid the situation that applies to other inquiries and tribunals, where many legal representatives do very well but there appears to be no redress. People who were in this situation are not concerned with the legal aspects. They simply want to be able to tell their story and see those individuals and institutions responsible for their abuse brought to justice. A society should not be afraid to confront those issues since it can become stronger only by addressing institutional abuse that took place in the past. Of course, we can also hope that the victims will become stronger from the opportunity to tell what happened.</P>
      <P>I hope that the legislation will improve the situation for those victims, that the Bill will ensure the truth emerges and that it is not merely about saving money or fast-tracking for its own sake. The absence of many of the victims&rsquo; groups tells a story, namely, that people are frustrated. They are not happy with how the commission has been operated. I hope that the main thing to emerge from this is that whoever wants to tell his or her story of abuse is given the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I too am glad to have a few moments to speak on this Bill. It is part of the process whereby the State is finally accepting its responsibility to deal with the abuse that took place. It is important that happens since it proves that no person or institution is above scrutiny. It also means that those who suffered abuse will continue to be heard. I am reassured by this Bill that it is part of that process of the State facing its responsibilities, something that was delayed for far too long. I commend the Taoiseach on tak<Col N="80"/>ing the initiative by issuing an apology on behalf of the State; it was long overdue.</P>
      <P>This Bill and the Act that it proposes to amend represent progressive steps by the State, and we should not forget that. That path had not been taken very frequently previously. It is true that, although well-intentioned, problems arose with the original 2002 legislation. The State made moves both to investigate claims of abuse and to recompense survivors in a way that was effective and sensitive, and that must be commended. However, problems emerged, and the suspension of the commission, the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and the acceptance by the State of her criticisms evidenced the existence of problems. We have a duty to investigate and resolve those problems. I am satisfied that the Bill is an important part of that remedy.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Mr. Justice Ryan was meant to probe those issues and, having established the review, it is our duty to act on its findings. We have a duty to give effect to those recommendations, and that is what the Bill will do. I will return briefly to the original legislation and its purpose. I mentioned that it was well-intentioned, and victims were promised an inquiry that would investigate every single claim of abuse. Not long after the establishment of the commission, it was realised that the expectation was unrealistic. Importantly, the victims&rsquo; group One in Four realised it was unrealistic:</P>
      <P LI="1">People are perhaps beginning to realise that this was never realistic, and that the inquiry would never do what civil law could not do. The expectations created were not realistic.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, admitted that the State was guilty of an error of judgment when it mandated the inquiry to investigate every claim of abuse. It is understandable that victims feel disappointed because they have every right to believe that a promise that was made is being reneged on.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The State has a duty to ensure the inquiry can deliver closure to victims in a reasonable length of time. Ms Justice Laffoy estimated that it could take up to 11 years, which is quite a long time, for the commission to complete its work. Just 40 of the 1,700 complaints received by the commission had been heard by October 2002. The State could not continue to pursue that approach because it was not in its interests or in the interests of the victims to do so.</P>
      <P>The good intentions of the original legislation should not be diminished in any way by the amendments being made. I am reminded of a motto adopted by doctors: &ldquo;first, do no harm&rdquo;. I would not support this amending legislation if I did not feel it is necessary and, more importantly, in the best interests of victims. It is important to emphasise that the Bill before the House clearly serves the interests of victims.</P>
      <P>The State must act responsibly by establishing an inquiry that can deliver results. The 1,300 <Col N="81"/>people who have applied to have their cases heard by the investigative committee will be invited for interview. The information obtained during such interviews will be recorded and reviewed. If there are material areas of dispute, the committee will arrange for further investigation, including further hearings, as appropriate. Such hearings will be heard in public, where possible. That change to the original arrangements has been made to provide for closure in a timely fashion. I would not support this legislation if I did not feel that it is in the best interests of victims. While the victims are not being given what was originally intended, it is significant that everyone will be heard in some context by the investigative committee. I am encouraged by that.</P>
      <P>I wish to expand on the importance of listening to victims&rsquo; testimonies. I had the great pleasure of attending a performance of &ldquo;James X&rdquo;, a fabulous one-man play written and performed by Gerard Mannix Flynn during last year&rsquo;s Dublin Theatre Festival. The play, which recounts the experiences of a victim, before and during his appearance at the redress board, is raw, moving and funny. The strength of the play is that it stresses the importance for victims of finally achieving closure. When the character&rsquo;s ordeal was over and he had finally presented his case, a weight was lifted from his shoulders and he was able to move on. It is important that we should give people the opportunity to move on.</P>
      <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan seemed to give the impression that not everyone will be heard. It is important to clarify this matter. Everyone will be heard and interviewed, even if everyone does not receive the opportunity to speak individually in an open public forum. It is understandable that survivors feel somewhat let down &mdash; they have the right to feel that way. I hope they will receive absolute clarity about the process of deciding to bring cases to full hearings.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes being made in this Bill because they are needed following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy and in light of the projected duration of the review. While it is regrettable that we have deviated from the original plan for the board&rsquo;s activities, we should understand that it is necessary. The views of survivors are paramount when dealing with this issue. I hope the Minister will continue to meet the representatives of those who were abused as we make progress with the redress process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak about the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005, which relates to residential institutions. I agree with Deputies who have said we need to examine what happened in day schools too. Regardless of where it happened, the abuse that took place was wrong and has had a huge impact on those who were abused. I understand why we are focussing on residential institutions, but we also need to investigate the occurrence of abuse in day schools.</P><Col N="82"/>
      <P>Abuse can take many forms. We have all heard horrific accounts of awful physical and sexual abuse and bullying. We recognise that bullying can have a terrible effect on young children. If bullying by adults and peers is allowed to continue, terrible damage will be caused. I ask the Minister of State to consider the possibility of allowing people who suffered such abuse to tell their stories, at least. It is worth considering the option of allowing people who had terrible experiences in day schools to recount their memories.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the substance of the Bill, the purpose of which is to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, the report and subsequent recommendations of Mr. Justice Ryan and the workings of the commission. It is hoped that the changes proposed will better enable the commission to complete a full inquiry into child abuse within a reasonable timeframe and at a reduced cost. The Bill establishes a statutory framework for the operation of an education fund for former residents of the institutions and their families. It makes a number of technical amendments to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002.</P>
      <P>The Bill changes the definition of abuse to allow the commission to find that abuse occurred where it &ldquo;could reasonably be&rdquo; assumed that acts or omissions caused serious harm to a person. This is not the first time the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 has been amended in this way. An attempt was made to amend the Act by means of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (Additional Functions) Order 2001. That statutory instrument, No. 280 of 2001, was introduced by the then Minister for Health and Children to allow for investigations into vaccine trials which occurred in 1960-61, 1970 and 1973.</P>
      <P>The statutory instrument was presented on foot of a report compiled by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children, entitled Report on Three Clinical Trials Involving Babies and Children in Institutional Settings. The Minister for Health and Children referred the report to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse on 13 November 2000. The commission was asked by the Minister to inquire into the clinical trials referred to in the report. This is such a serious issue, as we know, that the Government attempted to amend the legislation on a previous occasion. I am concerned that the previous attempt to throw some light on the vaccine trials seems to have been swept under the carpet by the Government. It was challenged in the courts and the Minister was deemed to have exceeded his powers in bringing forward this order.</P>
      <P>I have asked many questions about this and I am concerned about the responses I have received. I asked the first question on 29 June 2004 and was told that the recent judgment handed down by the courts was being examined and a decision would be made on the matter <Col N="83"/>when the examination was complete. I brought it up again on 15 December 2004 and the Minister for Health and Children told me that the order was <i>ultra vires</i> and the issue of vaccine trials would be considered in detail. He said that a number of complex issues had been considered, further consideration had to be given to some of them and that it was likely that discussion would also have to take place with the Commission to Inquire in Child Abuse before any final decision. I am now concerned that there is comprehensive amending legislation before us that does not refer to vaccine trials. I am alarmed that the vaccine trials are being swept under the carpet and forgotten.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue on 12 April 2005 and was told again that a number of complex issues had to be considered, they were approaching finalisation, discussions had taken place with a number of parties involved and it was hoped to conclude all considerations in the short term. I was told that it was not envisaged the child abuse amendment Bill would address the issue of the trials. That was the first indication that this Bill would not deal with vaccine trials. I had raised the issue with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste on the Order of Business on a number of occasions and was given to understand that this amending legislation would deal with the trials but it does not.</P>
      <P>I was told on 19 April that the statutory instrument must be revoked by a draft resolution to be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Once a statutory instrument is struck down in the courts, I understood that was the end of it. If the Minister did not have the power to bring it forward in the first place, and the court struck it down, it is null and void. Why must it be revoked in the Houses? Is there a need to do this? On 19 April I got the standard answer I have received for the past year, that complex issues had to be considered and the Minister was not in a position to outline the course of action the Government would take on this matter until all discussions had been completed, even though I had earlier been told they were complete.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister look at this again? The then Minister for Health and Children in November 2000 identified a number of questions that the report of the CMO could not answer &mdash; why children in care received the experimental vaccine, why some of the recipients were outside the normal age for the administration of the vaccines, was the end result for commercial gain or public good and why were the records of the trials so inadequate. Real people need answers to these questions but they are not getting them. This Bill is a missed opportunity and I ask the Minister on Committee Stage to include a power whereby the commission can investigate the vaccine trials.</P>
      <P>Looking at the High Court decision, this was struck down because a link could not be made between what happened at the vaccine trials and abuse so the vaccine trials could not be termed abuse. This Bill changes the definition of abuse <Col N="84"/>to include where it is reasonable to assume abuse occurred. Does that mean this SI No. 280 of 2001 will be reintroduced to cover acts or omissions that caused serious harm to the person?</P>
      <P>The definition in the 2000 Act includes the willful, reckless or negligent infliction of physical harm and also failure to care for the child which results, or might be reasonably expected to result, in serious impairment. Will that allow us to include or introduce another instrument or to amend the Bill further to allow the vaccine trials to be investigated? If this was introduced in primary legislation, there would not be any need for a statutory instrument so this is an opportunity to do that and clear this matter up.</P>
      <P>There is another problem where the Supreme Court said that some of the primary witnesses could not be forced to give evidence. I understand they were prepared to give written evidence. The people involved in these tests are in limbo as a result. The Minister at the time agreed that consent is the most important issue so if babies in cots in the 1960s had vaccines tested on them and the parents did not give consent, there are questions to be answered. People are now demanding those answers.</P>
      <P>Chapter 14 of the third interim report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is devoted to the vaccine trials and a great deal of work went into it. The CMO recorded that there were no statutory controls in force in this jurisdiction regarding the conduct of clinical trials at the time and that the ethical standards applicable were the General Medical Council guidelines, the Nuremburg Code 1947, the Declaration of Helsinki 1964 and the statement of the Medical Research Council printed in the report of the Medical Research Council 1962-63. This issue must be resolved. Some people&rsquo;s lives are on hold as a result of it and an opportunity now exists to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Section 7 allows for survivors to recount abuse. What if they cannot remember it, although they were abused? What help will be given to those who do not remember the detail of the abuse? The vaccine trial is a typical example of this. Six month old babies were injected, although the motives of those carrying out the trials were exemplary. If people cannot recall the details, how can they recount them?</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, it goes in the right direction. Terrible things happened in the past in these institutions. Such things also happened in day schools and we may need to allow those people to tell their stories. I would like to see the Government use this Bill to deal finally with the vaccine trials or at least to give some response as to what it intends to do. It is not fair to those whose lives are on hold not to give some response.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, stated that the key issue of consent could not be fudged because it is fundamental. Children in care have the same rights as other children. He pointed to a number of issues <Col N="85"/>related to the ethical basis for the trials and emphasised that he found the lack of documentation both puzzling and unsatisfactory. When he introduced legislation to direct a commission to investigate the issue, he described it as the ultimate guarantee against a cover up or whitewash. At this stage, however, it looks as if something is going on that should not be going on. I want a response from the Government on it and, if possible, an amendment to clear up this matter and give the commission power to carry on the work it started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill 2005. This is an important Bill and an important debate. We should never forget the hurt felt by the victims of child abuse, particularly child sexual abuse. I have worked with and assisted many adults and children over the years and their trauma and pain should never be forgotten by Members. As a State and a society we must do all in our power to assist those people but we must also be constantly on our guard to prevent these types of crimes against children.</P>
      <P>The sad reality is that such abuse is still going on in many dysfunctional and chaotic families, and many of the stories are hidden from the public eye. Most child sexual abuse survivors will not talk about their suffering and their pain. It is the responsibility of this House, therefore, to assist them through this legislation. Sitting on the fence is not an option. We all have a duty to give these people the maximum support and assistance.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the recommendations of the Report to the Government of the Review Group on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the report and subsequent recommendations of Mr. Justice Ryan on the workings of the commission. The amendments proposed in the Bill will better enable the commission to complete a full inquiry into child abuse within a reasonable timeframe and at a reduced cost. I welcome that because this matter is urgent. I also welcome the fact that costs will be reduced.</P>
      <P>The Bill will also establish a statutory framework for the operation of an education fund for former residents of institutions and their families. It will also make a number of technical amendments to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. That is the purpose of the Bill but we should never lose focus on the victims who have been affected by this hell on earth. Their horrendous suffering should never be forgotten.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 9, which amends section 14 of the principal Act by conferring additional powers on the investigation committee in its taking of evidence. It will now be entitled to require the discovery of documents, furnish questions which must be replied to and require parties to admit facts, statements and documents. The evidence obtained will be presumed to be <i>prima <Col N="86"/>facie</i> evidence of the matters to which it relates. Where a person, without good reason, refuses to comply with one of these requirements or with a direction issued under section 14(1) of the principal Act requiring the giving of evidence to the committee, the chairperson of the committee can award costs against him or her. The section provides that the investigation committee will take evidence of a person&rsquo;s conviction for abuse of a child as evidence before the committee of that abuse.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have openness and professionalism in this debate. We must also ensure we get to the heart of the matter while not forgetting that the victims must be respected and helped. This is not something that happened in the past. We must be constantly vigilant. Many of us have heard horrific stories through our constituency clinics in the past few years and recently. We must be on our guard and listen to the victims because many of them only declare their abuse in their 30s, 40s and 50s. I became aware of a case involving a man in his 40s who was sexually abused but who only declared the abuse recently. He had suffered that trauma for 20 or 30 years without disclosing it to anybody. We must be sensitive to these types of issues and give the victims the maximum support.</P>
      <P>Section 27 permits the board to pay grants to former residents of institutions, or relatives of former residents, to assist them avail of educational services. The board will have discretion as to the amount of the grant, the educational service for which it is paid, the frequency of payment and the conditions to be attached to the grant. It will have to decide on criteria by which decisions on grants will be made and will have to publish those criteria.</P>
      <P>I urge compassion, sensitivity and understanding of the victims in dealing with section 27 because if we do not take that approach we will be going nowhere in terms of their needs. It is important that when grants are being allocated we do not make the victims go through the hoops or make their lives even more difficult because their plight is very serious.</P>
      <P>Section 34 provides for a number of amendments to the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. The offence of giving false evidence to the redress board or the review committee is extended to any person who gives such evidence, regardless of whether they have made an application for an award. That is important because allegations will be made against certain people that might not necessarily be true. We must protect the rights of our citizens and those against whom allegations are being made. We must be on our guard in respect of section 34.</P>
      <P>Another amendment the section provides for is that in future, where an award is made but the applicant dies before deciding whether to accept it, the award will not die with them. That is a positive aspect. Where they are survived by a spouse or child, he or she may proceed with the application on the deceased&rsquo;s behalf. If the <Col N="87"/>deceased does not have a spouse or child, the applicant will be deemed to have accepted the award, which will be paid to their estate.</P>
      <P>The board will have discretion in deciding whether it needs to request a medical report on the applicant and remove the obligation on the applicant to appear in person at a board hearing.</P>
      <P>Section 34 also states that the board will have a discretion in relation to the evidence it is required to rely upon in cases where an application is made on behalf of a deceased person. This is a very important section.</P>
      <P>Section 29 provides that the board will consist of a chairperson and eight ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Education and Science. Four of the members must be former residents of institutions. That is significant because it provides an opportunity to the victims to have their voices heard at this level. If we are to bring forward commonsense proposals and help the victims, we must ensure their voices are heard.</P>
      <P>Section 30 provides for the employment of staff by the board, their remuneration and terms and conditions of service. It is very important to get the right staff involved in this issue. They must be sensitive and caring, know the rights of citizens and understand the victims. This is a very important section because whether one is dealing with children or teenagers, the key strategy is to have the right person doing the job in the right circumstances, particularly in the area of education or working with children with disabilities. We hear much talk in this House about breaking the cycle of disadvantage but there are many people working in very difficult situations, be they primary or second level teachers, who because of the nature of their skills are changing children&rsquo;s lives every day and having a positive impact in very negative circumstances.</P>
      <P>We must pay tribute also to the people who are on the front line and those who take risks. Let us not forget the people who do valuable work in the public service and those involved in sports and community groups and teaching organisations who took risks in the interests of defending the rights of the child and protecting a child from abuse. Section 30 is important in that regard because it deals with the employment of staff by the board.</P>
      <P>Section 32 requires the board to publish an annual report and to provide a copy of it to the Minister who must lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</P>
        <P>The United Nations department of peacekeeping operations has invited Ireland to contribute a small number of Defence Forces personnel to act as UN military observers with the recently established United Nations mission in the Sudan. The request to participate in the peacekeeping operation in the Sudan is being given the careful consideration all such requests from the UN receive. The mission is aimed to support the comprehensive peace agreement for southern Sudan which was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Army in Nairobi on 9 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of the peace process in the Sudan generally and in the troubled region of Darfur in particular. We have provided financial support to the African Union mission, to which we have also seconded an Army officer. Ireland has also contributed considerable aid support to the Sudan. Last week the Government announced that it would provide &euro;15 million for the recovery and reconstruction of the Sudan during the period 2005-07.</P>
        <P>Assessment of the UN request must to take into account the numbers of Permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service. Currently, 750 Irish soldiers serve abroad from a total of 850 soldiers maintained under the UN stand-by arrangements system. The number of soldiers can fluctuate and stood at approximately <Col N="89"/>770 some months ago. Members of the Permanent Defence Force serve currently in eight overseas UN missions, including those in Liberia, C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Lebanon and the Middle East. Personnel have also been assigned to the multinational forces authorized by the Security Council in Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina and Afghanistan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to supply soldiers to the Sudan mission? He did not make it clear whether he would, but said the matter was under consideration. Does he agree that the UN mandate in Darfur is ineffective? Observers from the African Union are helpless to address the atrocities which are taking place, but there are plenty of them to tell the western world what is happening. The UN mandate is ineffective because of the lack of resolve of the permanent members of the Security Council. The difficulty inherent in the Government&rsquo;s position on the triple lock is inherent in the requirement to wait for an organisation as ineffectively organised as the UN at Security Council level before any problem can be tackled. As the resolve does not exist in the Security Council to address this matter, I urge the Minister to make a point by refusing to supply soldiers and outlining the reasons I have stated for not doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The request is the result of UN Resolution 1590 of 24 March 2005. A small number of military personnel at officer level have been requested to act as observers to the mission in southern Sudan rather than in Darfur. The Chief of Staff of the Army has circulated the Defence Forces seeking volunteers and this process will conclude on 28 April. Currently, 134 officers serve abroad. If more than 12 officers come forward, D&aacute;il approval will have to be sought to send them overseas. The Government will have to decide, whatever number of officers volunteer, whether to send them to the Sudan and it will take a number of criteria into account. The process will involve asking how useful the mission will be to the overall situation in the Sudan and how it accords with Irish foreign policy. The most significant issue to take into account will be the level of risk associated with the mission. A risk assessment is being carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Minister may have answered some of the following, I restate the questions as supplementaries. Has a formal request been received from the United Nations for soldiers for the Sudan? Has the Minister consulted with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who has visited the Sudan? What is the current level of troop commitment to UN duty abroad and how many soldiers are likely to be required? Will the mission involve peacekeeping or peace enforcement?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="90"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>A formal request has been received for soldiers from the United Nations. I have consulted the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who has recently been to the Sudan and who has spoken to me about it in some detail. Our current commitment to UN missions abroad is 750 soldiers. According to the terms of the request we received, the mission will be a peacekeeping operation. A peace treaty has been signed and forces are necessary to maintain it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the UN observer mission is relatively ineffective?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has discussed the matter with me and expressed the view that there are serious problems with the current UN operation. It does not appear to be achieving the results we would all like to see. I agree, therefore, it is relatively ineffective. The UN has informed the Minister of State that it is attempting to take the appropriate steps to bolster the mission to make it effective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like it to be made very clear whether the mission is one of peacekeeping or peace enforcement. The Minister is aware of the instability in the Darfur region of the Sudan. Has an assessment been carried out of the security situation? Will the Minister provide an assurance that a full security assessment will be carried out before any Irish soldiers are committed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very happy to reassure Deputy Sherlock on the last point. We must carry out a security assessment before troops are committed to any mission. As we speak, a risk assessment operation is under way.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about peacekeeping and peace enforcement, and a great deal depends on how one interprets either term. According to the data which accompanied the UN request for soldiers, it appears the mission in southern Sudan is a peacekeeping operation. Others might interpret it differently. I will ask my officials to send Deputy Sherlock the information which accompanied the request. That should be possible and it would allow the Deputy to judge the matter for himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of the opinion that the force should engage in peacekeeping or peace enforcement? Is there not a significant difference between peacekeeping and peace enforcement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>While there is a significant difference, the Deputy will be aware that the Petersberg Tasks have been expanded to encompass peace enforcement as well as peacekeeping. I understand a comprehensive peace agreement for southern Sudan was signed by the Government of Sudan and the organisation calling itself The People&rsquo;s Liberation Army in Nairobi on 9 January 2005. As a result of the treaty, refugees will return voluntarily and human <Col N="91"/>rights will fall to be protected as people are entitled to live in peace. It is to facilitate this process that UN help has been sought. That looks like a peacekeeping operation, but whether it is peacekeeping or peace enforcement, both categories are covered under the Petersberg Tasks.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>the annual cost to his Department of providing military escorts for cash in transit transfers; the total amount of the cost, in cash and percentage terms contributed by banks for these military escorts; if he has asked banks (details supplied) to contribute more money to his Department for the military escorts given to security firms; if he has received any response from the banks to this request; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12524/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>To aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces. In this regard, the Defence Forces assist the Garda as required in duties which include escorting cash deliveries to banks, post offices and other institutions.</P>
        <P>An annual contribution of &euro;2.86 million is paid by the banks in respect of Army escorts. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and has not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces, which includes pay and allowances. Based on annual costings by my Department, the relative level of the contribution has fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it now only covers 43% of total costs.</P>
        <P>Since taking over as Minister for Defence, I have had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation on this matter, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs incurred by my Department in the provision of cash escorts. While the ongoing discussions are difficult and the banks put their position robustly, the banks and the IBF have been positive and constructive in their dealings with me and I welcome this.</P>
        <P>My most recent meeting with them was on Wednesday last, 13 April, and we continue to make progress. The Irish Bankers Federation will shortly revert to my Department following further discussions with its members. It is my hope that my officials and officials of the IBF will then be in a position to complete a draft memorandum of understanding between the Department of Defence and the IBF in regard to the financial aspects of the Defence Forces&rsquo; involvement in cash escorts.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in protecting movements of cash in 2003, the latest year for which figures have been finalised, was in excess of &euro;6.6 million, including pay, allowances, transport and aerial surveillance. This related to 2,335 escorts, approximately 80% of which covered deliveries to banks.</P>
        <P>For the first nine months of 2004, approximately 1,825 escorts took place. In any given month, approximately 1,592 Army man-days are expended on these escorts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has answered the last part of my question which related to the number of troops involved on an annual basis in escorting cash consignments. Does he consider it acceptable that financial institutions which make annual profits of billions of euro each year &mdash; last year AIB made profits of &euro;1.4 billion &mdash; should effectively ask taxpayers to subsidise the provision of escorts for them? Does the Minister believe that the financial institutions should pay for the escorts?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sherlock always asks his questions plainly and I will try to answer as plainly as I can. I do not consider it acceptable. If I thought it were acceptable I would not be negotiating for an increase. I would not have called in the institutions and said that I want an increased contribution from them.</P>
        <P>The initiative whereby the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, subsequently with back-up from the Army, began to escort these cash transit operations commenced in 1978 as a result of a spectacular robbery in my adjoining constituency in west Limerick, at Barna Gap where a large amount of cash was seized. There was paramilitary involvement in that robbery and it was considered at the time that the State had an interest in not letting large consignments of cash fall into the hands of paramilitaries or other criminal elements. Obviously the paramilitary threat has receded somewhat but there is ample evidence that the people involved in cash transit robberies at present are highly organised criminal gangs who are looking for money to invest, largely in the drug trade.</P>
        <P>I do not think it is acceptable that only 43% of our costs are being covered. I want that increased and I have engaged in extensive negotiations that are nearing completion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that there has never been a successful robbery of a cash consignment under Army escort? Given that, is it not reasonable that financial institutions would pay the full price for the provision of such escorts? When does the Minister hope his talks with the financial institutions will conclude and what prospects does he have for a successful conclusion for the State?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="93"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree it is not acceptable that only 43% of the costs of security escorts are being met at present. That is why I have been endeavouring to increase the contribution. I am not asking the banks for the full cost of the cash escorts because all the activity does not relate to banks. Some 20% covers post offices and a small amount relates to other financial institutions such as the Central Bank and so on. In effect, I am asking the banks to pay for what they are getting.</P>
        <P>They have made various points to me such as that they are contributing a great deal in taxes to the Revenue. They also make the point that there is an extra cost entailed when the Army is involved in cash escorts, such as subsistence allowances, security duty allowances, the cost of transport etc. They further stated that even today the amount they are paying covers that extra cost and that we would be meeting the basic wages anyway. That is the substance of their argument. I have put counter arguments but I am sure the House is not interested in the detailed negotiations.</P>
        <P>To answer the latter part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I have told the banks that I want this matter finalised and concluded within the next fortnight.</P>

        <Quest>the reason Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Defence Agency was not brought before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for consideration; the terms of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the agency; if membership will require an increase in defence spending; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>A decision to establish an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments, known as the European Defence Agency, was formally adopted at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 12 July 2004. Following an initial start-up phase during 2004, the agency is now operational, with its senior management in place and a budget and work programme for 2005 approved by defence Ministers of the participating member states.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of the agency is to assist member states in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in support of European Security and Defence Policy. To achieve this, the agency has been ascribed four functions relating to, defence capabilities development, armaments co-operation, the European defence technological and industrial base and defence equipment market and research and technology.</P>
        <P>The agency will be an important forum by which the EU can seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment, we should encourage developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies <Col N="94"/>of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Against this background, at its meeting on 6 July 2004 the Government agreed that Ireland would participate in the framework of the agency. There is no requirement for D&aacute;il approval for participation in the agency, which is an intergovernmental agency within the framework of ESDP. Participation in the framework of the agency does not impose any specific obligations or commitments on Ireland other than a contribution to the budget of the agency. Participation in individual projects of the agency will be a matter for national decision on a case-by-case basis.</P>
        <P>National contributions to the budget of the agency are calculated on the basis of the gross national income scale in accordance with Article 28(3) of the Treaty on the European Union. Ireland has paid a contribution of &euro;21,733.07 towards the agency&rsquo;s initial general budget of &euro;2.4 million for 2004. The budget for 2005, estimated at &euro;25 million, includes once-off capital provisions for accommodation and infrastructure items, and means that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution towards the running of the agency will therefore be of the order of &euro;315,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister knows, the EU constitution has not yet been approved and yet the European Defence Agency is up and running. Will the Minister indicate on what legal basis it is running or is it in a legal limbo? He says this was an intergovernmental decision. Is it not extraordinary that a move of such significance was not debated in this House? Is this considered to be so unpalatable for many Irish people that it was decided to try to hide it away until such time as the Green Party tried to expose it?</P>
        <P>On the question of spending, as the Minister probably knows, I was on the defence working group of the Convention on the Future of Europe. It was clear there that the idea behind this was not just to co-ordinate or spend better, but also to spend more. Will the Minister agree that as a consequence we will have to increase spending? That is precisely the idea, to make Europe more significant militarily on the international stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s questions in sequence. The Government took a decision on 6 July 2004, to participate in this agency. Every other government in Europe is participating with the exception of Denmark, according to my information. I presume the Attorney General attended that meeting, although it was before my time in Government. I presume he would have advised the Government if it was doing anything illegal.</P>
        <P>As regards the debate in the House, there is a number of things an Administration can do, without the requirement for a debate in the House. Sometimes matters which do not warrant debate may be decided by the Government if there is not <Col N="95"/>sufficient time. The Deputy can appreciate the pressure of time in the House. I respectfully suggest to him that if he wants a debate Private Members&rsquo; time is an obvious mechanism to use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not get too much of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley will also be aware that there is severe pressure on Government time. Every morning on the Order of Business we are asked the whereabouts of this, that or the other Bill. Time is not limitless. However, I would not agree that the objective of this agency is to spend more. It seems to me from what I have read about it, that the whole focus is on better spending and that is why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Better and more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I can see &ldquo;better&rdquo; is the primary focus. I do not believe there is anything particularly sinister about this. Every country in Europe, with the exception of Denmark, has agreed to participate. At the moment, we have just agreed to be involved in the framework. No particular project has been undertaken yet. For example, a procurement project has not been undertaken and nobody has yet done anything in this regard. As a sovereign State, Ireland has the right to decide on whether to get involved in any project initiated by the agency, on a case by case basis. All we have done so far is to agree to participate in the framework of the agency, in co-operation with our European partners.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>the position with respect to the availability of St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital to the Minister for Health and Children; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House will be aware, earlier this week I stated my desire to make the use of facilities at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital available to the public health service. This offer includes the three specific areas for the treatment of civilian patients identified back in 2001, but also includes any possible options that the Health Service Executive might wish to put to the Department of Defence for the use of medical and health care facilities at St. Bricin&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>On Monday last, 18 April, representatives from the Health Service Executive visited St. Bricin&rsquo;s hospital to inspect the facilities there. I inspected the hospital facility earlier this week. Further detailed examinations and surveys are now in process. The three possible areas identified in 2001 for treatment of civilian patients in St. Bricin&rsquo;s were acute day case surgery; the provision of step down inpatient services from acute hospital care, such as intensive nursing of the chronically ill, convalescent services for the hospitalised elderly etc.; and the use of the St. Bricin&rsquo;s <Col N="96"/>complex for general community-based health care and social care services.</P>
        <P>When the question of the potential use of St. Bricin&rsquo;s hospital for treatment of civilian patients was last looked at in 2000-2001, a detailed feasibility study was carried out into the first of the three identified possible uses, acute day case ophthalmic surgery, as a pilot project. That feasibility study indicated that this project would not have been cost effective for the Northern Area Health Board. In the event, the Northern Area Health Board secured access to suitable facilities elsewhere in Dublin.</P>
        <P>Since that time St. Bricin&rsquo;s hospital has undergone a refurbishment programme, including fire safety works and rewiring, largely focused on meeting health and safety criteria. Inpatient capacity at St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital has fluctuated over recent years due to refurbishment works and the use of some wards for medical storage. In reply to a parliamentary question in April last year, my predecessor indicated that the then functional capacity was 48, with an inpatient occupancy rate of 20% of capacity. It should be borne in mind that the Army medical corps itself does not have the staffing resources to operate a public health service. The possibility that the provision of treatment for civilian patients at St. Bricin&rsquo;s might raise some legal questions will also need to be examined.</P>
        <P>St. Bricin&rsquo;s Military Hospital is the logistics base facility of the medical corps.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Its functions are to provide a primary care facility for the Dublin garrisons, an occupational medical service base for the Defence Forces, a limited inpatient capability for the Defence Forces both in Ireland and in support of overseas deployment and a medical logistics base for the provision of medical equipment, pharmaceutical supplies and strategic medical supplies for the Defence Forces. The St. Bricin&rsquo;s complex also provides accommodation for the Army pensions board.</P>
        <P>I am now awaiting receipt of the considered opinion of the Health Service Executive arising from its inspections of St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital. I will positively consider its proposals for all possible public health care use of St. Bricin&rsquo;s facilities, and my Department is available to do everything possible to co-operate with it.</P>

If he did, would he agree that the director, Colonel Collins, would have told him what he said in his article in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, dated 7 March 2005, to the effect that it simply could not be used as a civilian facility in its current condition? He said a working group had investigated the possibility but found it was not feasible.</P>

	<P>I do not know what Deputy Timmins is talking about. As regards gimmick of the year award, I understand I was granted heckler of the year award, which is a sufficiently dubious distinction in itself.</P>
        <P>This is not a gimmick. I have been inundated with requests and people talking to me about St. Bricin&rsquo;s in view of the accident and emergency departments crisis. We all agree there is a crisis. St. Bricin&rsquo;s is a fine facility within easy distance of the Mater hospital and people believe it should be made available. I have had requests literally from the day I came into the Department. I have spoken to a number of people, including the Minister for Health and Children. She spoke to me about it two months ago. Various people from all sides of the political divide have asked me if it could be made available. I have always made it clear that it is my job and my decision whether to make it available. If the Department of Health and Children wants to use it in any capacity it is up to the Department to spend money on it. How much use it gets out of it will depend on how much money is spent.</P>
        <P>Deputy Timmins is right. There was a feasibility study in 2001, but that was only in relation to one particular use. The study group found that it was not cost effective, because it would have cost &euro;3 million at the time, for a limited throughput of patients. Since then about &euro;2 million has been spent on rewiring etc., which was a substantial part of the problem identified at the time. As regards Colonel Collins, I have no dispute with what he said. He said in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> that it could not be used without expenditure being incurred. That is precisely what I have said all the time. It is up to the Department of Health and Children. The Department is examining it as we speak. I understand architects are there from the Department of Health and Children. They will decide to what extent it can be used or how much they want to spend or can afford, and whether it is cost effective. I am only making it <Col N="98"/>available on the basis that the Department of Health and Children spends money on it. The use it will get from the facility depends on how much it is prepared to spend.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Earlier in the week I was shown around St. Bricin&rsquo;s by several people, including Colonel Collins. He, as the expert in the area, referred to various figures for putting the ward into public use. The air-conditioning in the operating theatre has to be adjusted to ensure it can be used. Our engineering section reckons this will cost X amount. The figures are relative modest when placed in the context of the total health services budget and the moneys spent on acquiring private nursing homes for step-down facilities. During the week I read a newspaper report that claimed that it had been decided the facilities could not be used, but that is rubbish. The Department of Health and Children has not yet come back to me on the proposal. I believe the facilities there can be used and I am confident they will be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Minister consult the medical director before he made the announcement? How much will it cost to get the 20 beds in operation? In a bid to save funds, will he tell the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children that there are 13 beds in a ward in Loughlinstown Hospital that are not used?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Approximately 100 beds could be used in St. Bricin&rsquo;s as there are only four patients there. Deputy Timmins may be concerned about the military holding what it has and the interests of the Defence Forces being served. However, PDFORRA, which represents enlisted troops, issued a statement welcoming the opening up of St. Bricin&rsquo;s for accident and emergency facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>As does the Fine Gael Party, if it is practicable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, along the lines I suggested. All Ministers can hold on to the empires in their Departments. However, if one is lying on a hospital trolley, different considerations apply. If beds are available, they must be used. I encourage the Department of Health and Children to take up the use of St. Bricin&rsquo;s facilities. It will be more cost effective than the measures being taken to resolve the crisis in accident and emergency facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>What will it cost?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The last costing I received was for &euro;3 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>For 200 beds.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No, 25 beds and the operating theatre. That will be 25 more free beds in the Mater.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 36 together.</P>
        <P>The Government decision on decentralisation provides for the transfer of my Department&rsquo;s Dublin-based Civil Service staff to Newbridge, County Kildare. The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200. The Government decision also provides for the transfer of 300 Defence Forces headquarters staff to the Curragh, County Kildare. A total of 385 personnel, of whom 78 are serving in the Department, have declared an interest in relocating to Newbridge.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is in discussions with Kildare County Council regarding the possible acquisition of a site in Newbridge for the Department&rsquo;s new headquarters. A site for the Defence Forces headquarters at the Curragh has been selected and preliminary planning for the design of the building has commenced. It is envisaged that the relocation will take place in 2007.</P>
        <P>The Civil Defence Board is being relocated to Roscrea, County Tipperary. There are approximately 30 posts in the Civil Defence headquarters. Part of the staff of the Civil Defence Board moved to temporary accommodation in Roscrea with effect from 10 September 2004. The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Departments, has issued tenders for the fit-out of a leased building in Roscrea. It is hoped that a contract will shortly be placed. It is expected that this building will be available for occupation later this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to sell the Defence Forces headquarters property on Parkgate Street? How many of the 30 Civil Defence Board personnel have moved to Roscrea? Since taking office, has the Minister examined changing his Department&rsquo;s decentralisation plan?</P>
        <P>Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick was stripped of several appointments that were subsequently moved to Clonmel. On Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme this afternoon, some of the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="100"/>buddies extolled his virtues and the way he looks after the Limerick East constituency. Will he satisfy their needs and reverse those positions to Sarsfield Barracks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted I still have friends in Limerick. The Department of Defence owns the headquarters in Parkgate Street. When the relocation takes place, it will become part of the property portfolio of the Department. A committee within the Department identifies properties that can be sold off. Presumably, the Parkgate Street property will be one. There will be a tendering process in which the committee will consider what to do with the property.</P>
        <P>Most of those based in Sarsfield Barracks are good friends of mine, whom I visit regularly. I have received no requests from officers or enlisted personnel there regarding Clonmel.</P>
        <P>Ten personnel from the Civil Defence Board have moved to Roscrea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister concerned that a massive training process will have to be put in place for the new staff &mdash; 220 &mdash; to be appointed to replace the shortfall in the transfers? Will the Minister agree that the process of transferring staff will lead to a remarkable loss of experience and knowledge in matters of defence. Does the Minister believe the figure might be higher than 78? Is this the total number of officials who are willing to move?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department will have no difficulty in moving civil servants to Roscrea, as more than 100 have expressed an interest in taking up the 30 places there. So far only ten have transferred as there is only accommodation for that number. Those 30 civil servants will be transferred and working happily in Roscrea before the end of the year. The 78 who have expressed an interest in transferring to Newbridge are civil servants serving in the Department of Defence. This figure is out of a total of 200 personnel who are to be transferred under the programme, which, in comparison to other Departments, is a relatively high take-up. Retraining will not involve Army officers but civilian staff. It is acknowledged that civil servants can easily move from one section to another.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that certain expertise is built up in an area? A civil servant from the Department of Agriculture and Food will not slip immediately into procurement assistance of military aircraft to the Defence Forces? Will there be transfers at assistant secretary and principal officer level or are those 78 positions from the lower grades in the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have this information but I will communicate it to the Deputy later. Staff are constantly moved within existing Departments. A civil servant working for years on third <Col N="101"/>level fees in the Department of Education and Science can be suddenly transferred to information technology. It is not a question of putting a civil servant into a certain section in a Department forever. That is not how the Civil Service works.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>In some Departments, members of staff have refused promotion because they must sign a commitment to move under the decentralisation programme. Has this happened in the Department of Defence?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not aware of that happening in my Department.</P>

	<P>He proposed to transfer the Civil Defence section of the Department. There are 30 civil servants working in that section, ten of whom have been relocated to Roscrea. At present, a building is being leased. The ten civil servants are involved in completing the transition to a leased, fully fitted-out building which will accommodate the other 20. There are ten civil servants there at present and it is expected that 30 will be there before the end of this year.</P>

        <Quest>his views on the 2004 report commissioned by the EU and written by a task force of the EU&rsquo;s Institute for Security Studies, European Defence: a Proposal for a White Paper; if this report has been discussed with the Irish Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12388/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The European Union Institute for Security Studies, EUISS, was created by a Council joint action on 20 July 2001. It has the status of an autonomous agency that comes under the EU&rsquo;s second &ldquo;pillar&rdquo;, the common foreign and security policy, CFSP. Having an autonomous status and intellectual freedom, the EUISS does not represent or defend any particular national interest. Its aim is to support and contribute to the development of CFSP and European security and defence policy, ESDP. The institute&rsquo;s core mission is to provide analyses and recommendations that may be of use and relevance in the continued evolution of ESDP. While the political and security committee of the EU exercises political supervision over the activities of the institute, it does not impinge on the intellectual independence of the institute in carrying out its research and seminar activities.</P>
        <P>The EUISS contributes to the development of the CFSP by performing three functions, research and debate on the major security and defence issues that are of relevance to the EU, forward-looking analysis for the Union&rsquo;s Council and high representative and development of a transatlantic <Col N="102"/>dialogue on all security issues between the EU on the one hand and Canada and the United States on the other.</P>
        <P>After the terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, the institute set up an independent task force to address the issue of European capabilities. In addition, the presidency report on ESDP approved by the European Council in Laeken in December 2001 stated that &ldquo;the institute will work in particular on a publication on European defence in the framework of the Petersberg Tasks&rdquo;. The paper, entitled European Defence: A Proposal for a White Paper, was the outcome of the work of this task force. It should be noted that the paper and the views expressed are those of the members of the task force and have not been endorsed by EU member states. However, the analyses and publications of EUISS would fall to be considered in formulating the Union&rsquo;s policy in regard to CFSP and ESDP and would inform the development of that policy, as do many other studies and analyses, not least the views of individual member states.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The European security strategy, which was endorsed by all 25 member states in December 2003, sets out the Union&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations on the development of ESDP. This, together with the headline goal 2010, sets out the policy direction, objectives and capabilities of the ESDP and rapid response elements for the foreseeable future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This institute is, according to the same Council joint action, an integral part of the new structures that support the further development of the European security and defence policy. Will the Minister confirm that the study published by this institute in October 2004 called for a comprehensive armament programme for the European Union&rsquo;s world role and, in the course of discussing various scenarios, did not rule out the use of nuclear weapons as part of a European Union defence policy? Does the Minister believe a White Paper will follow this proposal and are there definite plans to produce such a paper? What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to the inclusion of the nuclear option or nuclear scenarios in this proposed White Paper?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a summary of the study, which I can make available to Deputy Ryan. My reading of the study is that it is possible to interpret it as including a nuclear option. However, this is only one of many studies the European Union takes into account when formulating security and defence policy. The European security strategy, which was endorsed by all 25 member states in December 2003, sets out the European Union&rsquo;s analysis and recommendations on the development of a European security and defence policy. It contains nothing about nuclear <Col N="103"/>options, and that is the official European position.</P>
        <P>I do not know what plans there are for the development of a White Paper. However, regardless of whether a White Paper will be produced on the basis of this study, the study has not been endorsed by any member state. While this institute operates under the political supervision of the European Union, it has intellectual independence. It is entitled to write whatever report it wishes. We contribute approximately &euro;40,000 per annum to the running of the institute. We are not bound by what it writes. We will certainly look at it; the European Union looks at such studies when formulating the security and defence policy but it is not bound by them. This is only one of a number of analyses and presentations the European Union takes into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister appears to acknowledge the truth that should we proceed as proposed with the European Union common defence, as set out in the proposed EU constitution, we will be joining a defence policy that has a serious nuclear component, given the inclusion of British and French nuclear armaments in their defence capabilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not acknowledge that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed White Paper, as the Minister said, includes the possibility of a nuclear option or the use of nuclear armaments in defence actions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Anybody can write a paper which suggests anything, but that does not mean it will suddenly be accepted policy. Deputy Ryan is wrong and should withdraw his statement &mdash; it was not an imputation &mdash; that I accepted that we would be tied into a nuclear option. I do not accept that. I have told the Deputy, in clear English and in words of as few syllabi as possible, that this is one of a number of papers and analyses which the European Union takes into account in formulating defence policy. I pointed out that as late as December 2003, the European Union formulated a security and defence policy. I can make a copy of it available to the Deputy. It includes nothing about a nuclear option.</P>
        <P>The European constitution provides for a common defence but Deputy Ryan will be aware of the Seville declaration, under which Ireland opts out of it. There will be no participation by Ireland in a common defence unless the people, by way of referendum, decide there should be.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This report is not from an independent think-tank but was commissioned by the European Commission. The institute has an integrated statutory role within the structures of the European Union security and defence policy. This is not a think-tank, it is the future.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="104"/>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a think-tank. The European Union produced its policy in December 2003. That is European policy. The EU took account of everything said by everybody and the analyses of all types of think-tanks and produced its policy for the future. I am happy with that policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the debate on European Union security studies, the issue of common defence and the EU security policy, the concern is that we are moving in a direction with which the vast majority of Irish people are unhappy. They particularly do not wish to share a nuclear power position in the context of international foreign policy but believe they are gradually being brought down that road. People have genuine concerns. Does the Minister share those concerns? The issues of security, independence and Irish neutrality will emerge over the next year in the debate on the European constitution. The Government, particularly the Minister of Defence, must ensure that the Irish people are properly informed. There is an element of fear and doubt and we must respond to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s comments. There is certainly an element of fear but that fear has been stoked by certain people for their own political ends. The Seville declaration is crystal clear. It states that Ireland will not be part of any common defence policy, whether that involves nuclear options, infantry options or any other options. It will not be part of any common defence policy unless the people, by way of a referendum, decide that it should be.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>the costs to his Department for providing military escorts to banks; the reviews of this practice that are in progress; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12398/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>To aid the civil power is among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces. This means in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Sioch&aacute;na which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including protection of the internal security of the State. The Defence Forces assist the Garda as required in duties, which include escorting cash deliveries to banks, post offices and other institutions.</P>
        <P>The banks pay an annual contribution of &euro;2.86 million for Army escorts. The Department of Finance set this figure in the 1995 budget and it has not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to partially cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At <Col N="105"/>that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces, including pay and allowances. Based on annual costings by my Department, the relative level of the contribution has fallen in real terms over the years and it now only covers 43% of the total costs.</P>
        <P>I have had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation on this matter, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs my Department incurred in the provision of cash escorts. While the ongoing discussions are difficult and the banks put their position robustly, the banks and the IBF have been positive and constructive in their dealings with me. I recently met the IBF on 13 April and we continue to make progress. The Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation will soon get back to my Department following further discussions with their members. I hope my officials and officials of the IBF will then be in a position to complete a draft memorandum of understanding between the Department of Defence and the IBF on the financial aspects of the Defence Forces&rsquo; involvement in cash escorts.</P>
        <P>The total cost in the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Sioch&aacute;na in protecting movements of cash in 2003 was in excess of &euro;6.6 million including pay, allowances, transport and aerial surveillance. This is the latest year for which figures are available. This cost related to 2,335 escorts, approximately 80% of which covered deliveries to banks. For the first nine months of 2004, approximately 1,825 escorts took place. In any given month, approximately 1,592 army man-days are expended on duties covering these escorts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the remarkable series of bank raids recently, is the Department of Defence considering increasing the level of Army cover in such raids? Why was the charge not increased since 1995? What is the negotiating position of the banks? Given that the precedent of 72% of the total cost was set in 1995, what possible argument can be given by the banks not to return to that percentage?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot answer for what has been happening since 1995. I have only been Minister for Defence for the past six months. One of my first acts was to seek an increase in contribution from the banks. I am sorry negotiations have dragged on for so long. I have made it clear to the Irish Bankers&rsquo; Federation that any agreement will be retrospective to the time I took over as Minister for Defence. I am confident there will be a final agreement on this matter within the next two weeks.</P>
        <P>There are two elements to the cost of providing the Army for cash escorts. First, we pay wages to the troops, which we would pay anyway. Second, there is also a security duty allowance, a subsistence allowance, the cost of transport and in some cases, the cost of aerial surveillance. The banks <Col N="106"/>have made the point in negotiations that we would spend the first amount of money in any case, as we would pay the troops even if they were confined to barracks. The banks&rsquo; position is that the contribution to the Department of Defence covers the extra cost. The position I have taken, which I think the IBF has accepted, is that when we were looking at the level of standing army required, we had to take into account that this was one of the duties of the Army. In other words, we could have fewer troops if we did not have to provide this service. The IBF has largely accepted that view.</P>
        <P>There are some outstanding matters on how the cost is divided between the banks and other financial institutions such as An Post. There is also an issue surrounding an escalation clause on how much the fee is to be increased each year. The Department of Finance dealt with the matter centrally, which allocated the initial sum between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Defence. When I approached the Department of Finance about this, officials wanted to tie both Departments in at the same time. I could not do that as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform did its own deal last year. The next time I have to answer questions in the House, I am confident that this agreement will be in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I know it is popular to look for funding from the banks, but I feel uneasy with the concept in a democratic society of private industry paying to ensure that we have a secure environment for economic activity. Notwithstanding that, I ask the Minister to look at the concept of military escorts moving cash in a more random fashion. Deputy Sherlock mentioned that no cash escorted by military personnel had been robbed since the practice was initiated in 1978. The escort routes used by the military are well known and I am sure that criminals are aware of this. Will the Minister consider putting military personnel on escorts in a more random fashion, in conjunction with the garda&iacute;, in order to frustrate criminal activity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not doing this because it is popular.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am doing this because it is right. In 1995, the banks accepted that they should pay almost the full cost of these cash escorts. If it was right back in 1995, then it is right now and I agree with Deputy Ryan on that.</P>
        <P>The lead Department on the issue of cash escorts is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If cash in excess of a certain amount is being transported, then the banks have to secure a Garda escort. The Garda, in turn, contact the military. The question of random military escorts would, therefore, have to be discussed with the lead Department, but Deputy Timmins <Col N="107"/>has made a useful suggestion. If I stood here three years ago, I would have said there was no need for it, but the idea of robbing large consignments of cash has come back into fashion.</P>
        <P>Regarding the point about private industry, the banks are getting a great deal out of this as well. It is useful for a large financial institution making a big profit to have State security escorts, especially the Army, which has proved to be a 100% deterrent to criminals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>People are concerned that much of the money taken in the robbery in Artane will be invested in drugs. Does the Minister share those concerns? Does the Minister share my concern that there was a lack of professionalism from the security company and the banks, as well as a lack of concern from the State? My final question on charges relates to going after the banks to pay for the services. I agree with Deputy Timmins that the State has a duty to protect its citizens. I am concerned about private industry being involved in providing escorts for banks. Does the Minister accept that if he goes after the banks which, in turn, will face increased costs, they will then screw their customers? That is another concern with which we will have to deal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s last point could be used as an argument for never imposing any kind of levy on banks or financial institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying that the State has a responsibility, so let the State do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sherlock mentioned the figures for bank profits earlier but everyone would agree that what we are asking them to pay, in addition to what they are paying already, will be like a drop in the ocean given their overall profits. I am sure it would cost more to devise some system to take it back from the consumers, given that the cost involved is so little compared to the banks&rsquo; overall profits.</P>
        <P>Of course I share Deputy Finian McGrath&rsquo;s concerns about this money being used to invest in the illegal drugs business. Back in 1978 when this system was first introduced &mdash; at the behest of the State &mdash; the fear was about large sums of cash falling into the hands of subversives. The subversive threat has receded somewhat, although not completely, since 1978. Currently, the people involved in such crime seem to emanate more from the organised criminal fraternity. There is plenty of intelligence to this effect so there is no doubt that a lot of that money is being robbed precisely for the reason the Deputy mentioned, namely to invest in the drugs trade. Robbing cash transits is regarded as a fairly dangerous activity, whereas it is much less risky to get involved in the drugs trade, particularly if one is at the top of the drugs ring and removed from the action on the ground.</P><Col N="108"/>
        <P>I also agree with Deputy Finian McGrath about the lack of professionalism in the security industry. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently expressed grave concerns about that matter. He has met with representatives of the security industry and has given them about four months to get their act together. It is not before time.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>The military authorities have advised that the strength of the Reserve Defence Force, including An Slua Muir&iacute;, is 12,287. Good progress has been made with the reorganisation to date. On 26 July 2004 my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, officially launched the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, which is the start of a process that will radically change the structure and configuration of the reserve while preserving its traditional strengths. These include such things as the spirit of voluntary commitment, the maintaining of strong links with local communities and a nationwide geographical spread.</P>
        <P>An important change recommended by the study of the reserve is that members of the FCA and the Naval Service Reserve should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions subject to suitable qualifications, personal availability and appropriate advance training. In other countries service by reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although what we have in mind relates more particularly to specialist areas such as medical, transport, engineering, communications and information services.</P>
        <P>While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve Defence Force in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of reserve personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the Reserve Defence Force implementation plan.</P>
        <P>The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. It is intended that the Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured. I have been advised by the relevant military authorities that the required <Col N="109"/>regulatory changes, including the new establishment, change of title etc., will come into effect on 1 October and it is envisaged that the implementation of this plan will take place over the course of the period to end 2009.</P>
        <P>The plan defines the organisational framework of the new Army Reserve and provides for a greater concentration of units within each Army brigade area. There will be mergers both at battalion and company level as well as between sister technical support units. This will be the key to providing enhanced training facilities and opportunities for each member of the reserve.</P>
        <P>In producing detailed proposals for the restructuring of reserve units within each brigade area, the military authorities have taken due cognisance of the existing FCA presence within communities. Consultation and communication have been a priority throughout the development of the plan. They will continue to be important if the changes now proposed are to be carried through smoothly and effectively. Reserve units will be kept informed of developments on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment as well as more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisational structure and opportunities for suitably qualified personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the regular Army.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he believe that, following this reorganisation, a lot of FCA accommodation and property will be underutilised or not utilised at all in certain parts of the country? I am aware that in certain places, FCA property is rented but in other cases the Department owns it. Has the Minister examined this aspect and, if so, does he have any plans to deal with it? If any property is sold off, I urge the Minister to use the accrued funds for the Defence Forces. If such property is not sold, it should remain in public ownership for use by the local community. The Minister spoke earlier about the OPW obtaining a site in Newbridge for the decentralisation of civilian staff in the Department of Defence. If we still had a section of the old McGee Barracks in Kildare it might have been useful for such a project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>An implementation group in the Department is operating the restructuring of the Defence Forces. It is true, however, that certain property owned by the Department of Defence, which is being used currently, will not be in use later. I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to hear that we have a standing agreement with the Department of Finance that money raised through the sale by the Department of any unutilised property is ringfenced for us to use on upgrading the current barrack structure and on <Col N="110"/>purchasing new equipment for the Army. Therefore, any money from the sale of defence property is ringfenced for the Department of Defence.</P>

        <Quest>if, in relation to the removal of a person (details supplied) as chairman of the Civil Defence Board, he can reconcile, on the one hand, the statement of his predecessor in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 29 June 2004, that this person&rsquo;s actions in relation to three specified matters, which he had reviewed, had hampered the effective performance of the Civil Defence Board&rsquo;s functions pursuant to sections 8(1)(<i>n</i>) and 8(1)(<i>o</i>) of the Civil Defence Act 2002 and that his removal was necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions, with, on the other hand, the terms of the agreed statement in settlement of the judicial review proceedings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12354/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms of the statement of settlement referred to by the Deputy were agreed by both parties in the context of the former chairman of the Civil Defence Board agreeing not to proceed with his application for judicial review. I consider, therefore, that it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to comment either on that statement or on the statement of my predecessor in this House on 29 June 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The record speaks for itself. I was in the House when the former Minister for Defence made the statement. I am raising this question because the former Minister made a serious allegation against a former chairman of the Civil Defence Board, Dr. Michael Ryan, that I believe should not be allowed to remain on the record. That is the purpose of tabling this question.</P>
        <P>On 29 June 2004, the previous Minister suggested that Dr. Ryan had to be removed from his position because he had hampered the effective performance of the Civil Defence Board&rsquo;s functions, and that this removal was necessary for the effective performance of the board&rsquo;s functions.</P>
        <P>When Dr. Ryan took a court action for unfair dismissal, the matter was settled on 24 November 2004. As part of the settlement a statement was read by the Minister referring to the honourable and dedicated service of Dr. Ryan, and praising the manner in which he had carried out his responsibilities.</P>
        <P>The question is whether the statement made by the Minister or the statement read out in court is correct. Which is it? Does the Minister accept that a serious injustice was done to Dr. Ryan? Will he now formally withdraw the serious accusation against Dr. Ryan? The accusation was made but was changed afterwards by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to know exactly what the Minister has to say. An accusation was made but that was changed in court. The accusation made against that person cannot remain on the record of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not make the allegation. I will briefly explain the background. I cannot dispute the validity of anything Deputy Sherlock has said, but except for the settlement, all these events preceded my time in the Department of Defence. When the individual referred to in the question was sacked as chairman of the Civil Defence Board, he initiated an action for judicial review. I told my officials in the Department to keep the matter at arm&rsquo;s length from me because I know the gentleman. He resides in Limerick and does business there, and as I know him personally I did not want to be personally involved in any way.</P>
        <P>On the steps of the court an agreement was made that the individual would not pursue his case if the Department agreed certain matters. I was asked by the Secretary General whether I would approve the matter being settled out of court rather than proceeding to a major court case and incurring costs. Being a member of the <Col N="112"/>legal profession, I believed an out of court settlement was the most sensible way to proceed, and said so.</P>
        <P>That was my only involvement in the case. I made no allegations and it serves no purpose for me to comment one way or another on allegations made by any other Member of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>He was the Minister's predecessor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. He made a statement, and in the agreement between the individual concerned and the Department of Defence, the Department made its own statements. As far as I can determine, the matter is now closed.</P>

My Department&rsquo;s contribution to that is to phase out the 250 extra recruits over a three-year period. We are still authorised to have 10,500 members of the Permanent Defence Force. Regarding the Naval <Col N="112"/>Service, there are 45 recruits in training out of a total of 250 Permanent Defence Force recruits. Regarding particular officerships and particular positions where there are vacancies, such as watchkeeping officers and marine engineers, the 45 people in training for those positions constitutes a record number.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the matter of the DASH project, which relates to the mobility access works being carried out at DART stations throughout Dublin. Initially, the contractors working for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann promised that the work on the south side of Dublin would be carried out in one tranche within a nine to ten-month period. We were told that following a long public consultation period. As a public representative I co-operated with that consultation as I understood the important nature of the works. However, it emerged soon afterwards that a second tranche would be required.</P>
        <P>Needles to say, people living on the south side of the city were badly inconvenienced but nobody complained much because they understood that a great public amenity was being provided. They understood the advantage for public transport and the inconvenience was borne well by everybody. When it was announced that a second tranche was required, we naturally wanted to know why. It has since emerged that the reason for the closures, which are to take place at weekends on the south side of the city in June, July and August, is the failure by some group of people in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to recognise the need for planning permission with regard to building works on bridges associated with southside DART stations. We are being asked to accept that the cost of this public failure is to be met from the pockets of private traders, people who will lose business. Blackrock, Dalkey, Sandycove and D&uacute;n Laoghaire will also lose, for the second time, the tourist trade which arrives into those villages throughout the summer.</P><Col N="114"/>
        <P>We understand the value of the public amenity to be provided, which will ensure wheelchair access to the DART service. Unfortunately, nobody has been straight with the people affected. Nobody has been clear with regard to what is causing the delays. It now emerges that there is a possibility of a third closure, which is why I raise this matter in the D&aacute;il. If there is no guarantee that this third closure will not take place and that the work will be completed in June, July and August, I support the view that the work should be postponed until perhaps February of next year. It is unacceptable to have this situation arising over and over again.</P>
        <P>This situation arises because An Taisce has appealed the granting of planning permission by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not have a decision until next September. It is only then that the work can be carried out. I have not had a clear answer from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as to whether it will be able to carry out the works during the 13 weeks referred to or whether it will have to resume the work again at Christmas. It is seriously asking us to tolerate closure of the DART during the Christmas period, the peak shopping season. This is devastating, for a third time, and is due to a public failure to acknowledge and recognise that there will be a planning permission requirement.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take control of what is going on. The Minister is not getting the facts from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. An Taisce is wrong-minded in the appeals it has made in this area. It should never have made those appeals because these matters have already been decided by An Bord Plean&aacute;la. All the issues I have raised, and the grounds of appeal made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, were well ventilated before. The only reason that permission has been sought for a second time is that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann recognised that the plans did not comply with part M of the building regulations.</P>
        <P>An Taisce has no business in making its appeal. I have asked it to withdraw its appeal and to let the work be carried out. It will clearly not do that so I ask the Minister to take control of the issue. He is not getting the facts from the interested parties. I ask the Minister of State to support my view that the work should be put back until the new year unless a guarantee can be obtained that the work will be done in 13 weeks.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputy Andrews for raising this issue. As he said, responsibility for the management of the DART upgrade rests with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and specific detail regarding implementation is a matter for the company. I listened intently to what the Deputy said and am concerned that he feels I may not be getting the facts. I would be happy to tease that matter out with him.</P>
        <P>I have been monitoring some of the work for a number of reasons and take this opportunity to congratulate the project team on some of its stra<Col N="115"/>tegies and on the manner in which it has gone about the work with as little disruption as possible to the services.</P>
        <P>The DART upgrade project is the largest investment project undertaken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann since the DART service began in 1984. It involves significant infrastructural support and will deliver a 100% increase in the service. This process has been ongoing for some time. The work includes doubling the fleet of DART cars, replacing the overhead wiring, building new electricity sub-stations, lengthening all platforms and providing full access for mobility impaired customers at all stations.</P>
        <P>By the end of the DART upgrade we will have invested in excess of &euro;176 million on the project and a further &euro;80 million on the purchase of DART cars. The project began in October 2003. To minimise the impact on customers and ensure that the core services were running Monday to Friday, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann designed the work programme to ensure that interruptions to services were confined to weekends. That approach involves 24-hour working by the project team from the last DART service of Friday to the powering-up of the service on Monday mornings. This was considered to be the most effective way of undertaking such a large project.</P>
        <P>From October 2003 to July 2004, excluding the weeks before Christmas, services were suspended at weekends between Pearse and Greystones stations. All platforms on the southside were lengthened, and all overhead lines renewed during these suspensions. Similar work on the northside has been taking place from August 2004 and will continue until the end of May 2005.</P>
        <P>Because of planning and property issues encountered during the first period of scheduled works on the southside, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has informed the Department that it was not possible to complete all planned works and that it will be necessary to suspend weekend services between Pearse and Greystones stations to complete accessibility works at southside stations. The company proposes to suspend services from June 2005 for 13 weekends. This work is required to facilitate accessibility. I would be happy to tease out Deputy Andrews' suggestion with him and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in this regard.</P>
        <P>Planning permission is required in respect of the work to be carried out on the southside stations and the Deputy is correct that some appeals have been lodged. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has worked hard to minimise any objections likely to be raised to its proposals for upgrading each station. Many of the stations are architecturally significant and all works carried out must have regard to both the building and the impact that the changes will have on people living in the vicinity.</P>
        <P>The need to return to the southside was signalled publicly by the company in June 2004. The Department has asked the company to ensure <Col N="116"/>that the work is carried out in the shortest possible time frame and with the minimum disruption to DART customers. We have also asked that additional bus services be provided along the route of the DART to cater for inconvenienced customers and that these additional bus services be published in a timetable for the relevant period.</P>
        <P>Until the works at the southside stations are completed, mobility impaired people, including mums with pushchairs, will not be able to have full access to the DART network. I appreciate the frustration of people about these additional weekend closures. We must have patience and understanding as the work must be carried out as Deputy Andrews is aware and is happy to have done. I would be happy to arrange a meeting with Deputy Andrews, Department officials and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to have the facts clearly discussed and appropriate solutions agreed to.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the issue of the need for the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider her decision to disband the advisory committee for the deaf and hard of hearing. A letter dated 9 March was sent to the chairperson of the advisory committee which says:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">given that the Committee in question has failed to submit a report by the two previous deadlines imposed by my predecessor, I consider it unlikely that the Committee will reach consensus in the near future. Therefore, I regret to advise you that, as indicated by my predecessor Noel Dempsey, I have decided that the Committee should now disband and I request that you forward a copy of all the material produced to date to my Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raise this issue having met the Irish Deaf Society which has serious concerns at the disbandment of this committee. The society accepts the deadlines were not met, but it questions why the committee was not consulted before a letter was sent to the chairperson. The society says it only heard about a week ago that the committee was disbanded.</P>
        <P>The position put by the Irish Deaf Society is that it suggested an interim report at an earlier stage, but this was turned down. It also wanted a majority-minority report because the truth is it was not possible to reach agreement on the advisory committee. The society has stressed strongly that the divisions of point of view on the committee did not relate to the deaf community itself, but rather to differences of opinion between the service providers and representatives of the deaf community.</P>
        <P>The society has also suggested to me that representatives of the Minister&rsquo;s Department would not facilitate or did not want to have a majority report with a minority report attached and that it was as a result it was decided that the committee would no longer sit. The society has explained that a great deal of work had been done, it would <Col N="117"/>have only taken approximately another six months to complete the work and that it had already set up a sub-committee to compile and edit the final report.</P>
        <P>In effect the work was nearly done. I understand 200 submissions were made to the committee and a great deal of work was done over a three-year period. I urge the Minister reconsider this decision, particularly in light of the concern that it appears this tranche of work will be addressed through the National Council for Special Education. I submit that committee will have to start all over again to become acquainted with the issues. It also has much other work to do because it is an new body set up under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.</P>
        <P>I make this appeal on behalf of the Irish Deaf Society and urge that this issue be reconsidered. The society also made the point that representation on the committee was heavily balanced in favour of service providers as opposed to the deaf community. I know this was changed along the way and that four representatives of the schools were put on it. At the same time, the society felt there was a genuine disagreement that could not be reconciled and that it would be logical in that situation to allow for a majority report with a minority report attached.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are also concerns that the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, had a view that the differences of agreement were within the deaf community but the society argues strongly that this is not the case. It gave me reports from various D&aacute;il debates on the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill that seem to indicate the former Minister&rsquo;s belief. He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Unfortunately, the problem has arisen that the attitudes being adopted on both sides of the argument within the deaf community appear to be almost mutually exclusive. . . .</P>
        <P LI="1">Unfortunately, that committee has twice failed to meet deadlines I set for it to produce its report because both sides of the argument want to totally exclude the other&rsquo;s point of view. The difficulty is that a variety of voices has been raised to represent the deaf community.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, some people within the community say that is not the case. I urge the Minister to reconsider this decision urgently in the circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The advisory committee on the education of the deaf and hard of hearing was established in December 2001 by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, with the following terms of reference: to review the adequacy of the current range of educational support services available to students who are deaf or hard of hearing, to identify and prioritise <Col N="118"/>areas of service provision which require development or adjustment and to bring forward proposals considered appropriate to ensure the development and delivery of an appropriate, effective and efficient education support service for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.</P>
        <P>The committee met 38 times in plenary session and a number of sub-committee meetings also took place. Submissions were invited from the public and three regional listening meetings were held in Dublin, Cork and Galway. Early in the committee&rsquo;s deliberations, it became apparent that there were entrenched, divergent views on approaches to the teaching of the deaf and hard of hearing and there was little willingness to reach consensus. In a number of cases, decisions arrived at sub-committee stage were challenged at plenary level by members who were involved in the decisions of the sub-committee.</P>
        <P>While various chapters of the committee&rsquo;s report were drafted, including those on early intervention, primary education, post-primary education, visiting teacher service and communication issues, no consensus was reached on any of these due to the divergent views of members of the committee. Given that two deadlines had not been met, the Minister for Education and Science&rsquo;s predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, met the committee in June 2004 to progress matters. At the meeting, he stressed that its report should be completed by October 2004.</P>
        <P>The Deputy stated that the committee was taken by surprise by the decision to disband but it was well signalled to its members in June that time was running out and they should conclude by October. It was not possible for the committee to meet the deadline or to progress the completion of its report by October 2004. In the circumstances and following consultation with officials and the chairperson of the committee, the new Minister, Deputy Hanafin, formed the view that there was no prospect of the advisory committee reaching an agreed position in the foreseeable future. Given this position she recently wrote to the chairperson of the committee and informed her of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to disband it.</P>
        <P>However, in disbanding the committee, the Minister requested that all the material produced by it to date be sent to her Department, and that has been done. She intends to discuss the important issue of deaf education with the National Council for Special Education with a view to carrying out research initially and devising policy on issues relating to deaf and hard of hearing pupils. The Minister is disappointed that it was not possible for the committee to complete its work but the reality was that more than three years after its establishment, there was no prospect of it doing so. Rather than continue down the cul de sac that the committee&rsquo;s work had become, she has decided that a different approach is required, including involving the National Council for Special Education, which <Col N="119"/>has a remit to advise the Department of Education and Science on policy matters.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the battles that took place and the attempts of service providers to take over the issue, which I will relay to the Minister. However, the decision to disband the committee was not taken lightly. Progress was painfully slow and none of the chapters was signed off on because people had set views. I identify with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments about service providers. Professionals came in and had their own battles, thereby, taking away from the issue about which the deaf people were concerned. I do not hold out much hope.</P>

        <P>This issue arises following the largest meeting ever of the Association of Landscape Contractors of Ireland recently in Goatstown, Dublin. Contractors from a wide area were drawn together because they are faced with the serious problem of not having a site within reach to dispose of organic material such as grass cuttings, hedge clippings and so on. At the time it appeared the Esker Lane facility in Lucan, County Dublin, would close but it has been given a stay of execution, although it has a licence for only 5,000 tonnes of waste. It is in danger of being overrun.</P>
        <P>In addition, since January the St. Anne&rsquo;s Park facility has not been available. It operated for 15 years but, due to the mismanagement of the facility and the failure to address problems such as odours, spores and traffic, the patience of residents in the area has run out. However, the issue of the disposal of green waste needs to be addressed. The St. Anne&rsquo;s facility recycled 25,000 tonnes of valuable material, which was returned to landscape contractors for use in their work. Following a meeting between the contractors and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government two months ago, the Government failed to take decisive action to facilitate and ensure the creation of green material reception facilities and transfer stations within the greater Dublin area, which could provide an outlet.</P>
        <P>I have been asked by the association to raise the issue of waste licences. A licence is needed even where a two-wheel trailer is used to move material between two customers as that is considered to be a transfer of waste, even though it comprises useful material such as grass clippings, which is not waste. The issue needs to be addressed for practical reasons. Such material should be exempt under the regulations for waste carriage licences because positive ecological operations are restricted.</P>
        <P>The association seeks an allowance for the storage of a maximum of 50 cubic metres of green material to encourage people to compost on site, <Col N="120"/>which many of us are encouraged to do by local authorities. However, in doing so, if we do not have a waste licence, we are breaking the law, which is ridiculous given that we are doing our best to avoid sending waste to landfill, as are landscape contractors.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State ensure the Government provides the necessary facilities, which are widely available in other countries? Galway is once again ahead of many other towns and cities in that one third of its municipal waste is used for composting. It is a misnomer to describe it as waste because it is useful material. My colleague, Councillor Niall &Oacute; Brolch&aacute;in, in Galway has been to the fore in lobbying for the construction of that facility. I hope that example can be followed elsewhere, particularly as it is following throughout Connacht. Green material must be put in a skip, which must be paid for, and that is not all, since it also goes to landfill and creates methane, something on which we are trying to cut down, as well as leachate. It is also a needless waste of a valuable material. One hopes the Minister will see his way to according this matter the priority it deserves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is out of the country on official business, and I am afraid the answer is rather general and not related to the specific issues the Deputy raised.</P>
        <P>Ensuring the provision of waste facilities in line with the relevant waste management plan is primarily a matter for the local authority in question, and the Minister has consistently emphasised the importance of the local authority taking responsibility in the area. The Department operates a capital grants scheme for recycling and recovery facilities, under which nine green waste facilities have been grant-aided, and more are under consideration. However, the scheme is not sufficient to assist in the provision of all the infrastructure desirable; nor does its existence dilute the obligation on local authorities to provide for such infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The obligation on local authorities to provide for facilities is, however, regarding household waste rather than waste arising in the course of commercial activities. Recycling, recovery or disposal of commercially arising waste is specifically the responsibility of the producer, and the local authorities are not obliged to provide facilities to, or to accept material from, the producer. Consistently landfilling commercial green waste is not viable owing to our commitment to reduce the proportion of biodegradable waste going to landfill. Against that backdrop, it seems there is a very obvious commercial opportunity regarding collection, shredding or compaction and composting of such green waste.</P>
        <P>I know there are particular problems in Dublin, as the Deputy has said, regarding the closure of St. Anne&rsquo;s Park, which, to my limited knowledge, might be partly owing to the fact that it started <Col N="121"/>taking in too much commercial waste. There did not seem to be objections from residents when it catered more for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point I was making. It got too big, and it was not simply vans from landscape gardeners. It is not in my constituency, but I heard reports of 40-ft. trucks going in. It was the scale that people complained about.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Green waste, including commercially arising green waste, continues to be accepted at Esker Lane in Lucan. Looking to the future, however, South Dublin County Council will prioritise domestic users and commits itself only to keeping the facility available to householders. In the short term, the council will apply to the EPA for a revised waste licence for the green centre in Esker Lane so that the intake of green waste might be increased. All the Dublin local authorities are working hard to identify potential alternative and supplemental locations for the collection and compaction of green waste prior to transport for recycling elsewhere. Householders will, however, continue to have priority at any locations identified.</P>
        <P>I hear the Deputy&rsquo;s point. There is nothing in this about the issue of people requiring licences just to move around. I will relate that back to the Minister, but I believe I heard some mention of Dublin City Council having identified a site in Ballyfermot on which it is following through. That is not in the script.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this very important issue. I raised it on the Adjournment approximately six months ago, and I have done so consistently on the Order of Business and whenever I got the opportunity, privately and publicly, with the Minister.</P>
        <P>This is one of the great scandals of recent years. I speak not of the illegal dumping itself, but of the inactivity since the waste was uncovered. It is now more than three years since many hundreds of thousands of tonnes were uncovered in County Wicklow. I have a very specific matter on the Adjournment. It is to do with the illegal waste that has been dumped on a site known as <Col N="122"/>O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s, Whitestown, Stratford-on-Slaney and the Roadstone Lands at Blessington. In three years, not an ounce of waste has been removed. It is extremely difficult to have confidence in the statutory bodies when one sees what has happened in this case. There has been no activity and nothing moved out of the site. A new housing estate has been built no distance at all from one of the sites &mdash; about as far as I am from the Minister of State at present. If he, or any of his staff, takes a trip there, he will see 20 or 30 vents a few metres from new houses. It is an absolute disgrace. The Government&rsquo;s own guideline issued in 1994 prescribes a distance of 50 metres from any landfill owing to the danger of gas. No new house should be constructed within that distance. Those new houses are literally on top of that illegal dump.</P>
        <P>I will not beat around the bush, since what I seek is quite simple. I want the Minister to use his powers, as he intimated he would last October, under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 to issue a direction to the relevant authorities to deal with this matter once and for all. As a local public representative, I find it very hard at this stage to go out and try to explain what is happening, since no one has any confidence that anything will be done. I beg the Minister to do something about this. The power is there in that Waste Management Act 1996. I am sure that, when it was drawn up and the use of this section was envisaged, it was for something far less significant than the extremely serious problem that we have in this case.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt that, in the coming years, many other illegal dumps will be uncovered. The activity or inactivity of the statutory bodies to date regarding these two sites will certainly not act as a disincentive to any illegal dumper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry this matter has arisen on the wrong day. I am sure that the Deputy would rather have had the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, from his own constituency to answer him. However, I can read out to him the answer I have here.</P>
        <P>Waste management enforcement action is a matter for the relevant local authority and the Office of Environmental Enforcement. The Waste Management Act 1996 empowers local authorities to require by notice specified measures to be taken regarding the holding, recovery or disposal of waste to prevent or limit environmental pollution. Under the Waste Management Act 1996, the Environmental Protection Agency has statutory responsibility for waste licensing and is independent in the discharge of its functions. It would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment on any of the specified cases mentioned. Having said that, I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns that the enforcement proceeding should be progressed with a little more urgency. I am sure the Minister shares his concern.</P><Col N="123"/>
        <P>On a more general level, the Minister is committed to issuing statutory guidance under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996, which the Deputy mentioned, to local authorities regarding the remediation of sites that have been the subject of unauthorised waste activities. The intention of that guidance is to give local authorities and the agency a clear focus on the protection of human health, the environment and the property of third parties in responding to illegal waste activities. The Minister intends to issue that guidance within the next few weeks. However, I stress that it will not deal with individual cases. Section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control regarding the performance in particular circumstances of a function conferred on either the agency or a local authority.</P>
        <P>Let me detail what is happening overall regarding illegal sites. Substantial powers exist under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable both the local authorities and the agency to tackle illegal waste activity. They were further strengthened by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Local authorities are empowered to order measures to be taken regarding the disposal of waste, including the remediation of any effects arising from illegal activities. They may also directly take appropriate action to remedy or counteract such activities and to recover their costs through the courts. Local authorities also enjoy substantial powers to halt vehicles, inspect premises and examine records found. The burden of proof in certain enforcement activities has been changed, in light of the experience of illegal dumping, to require that defendants must demonstrate that their activities do not cause environmental pollution. The courts can assume in certain cases that a landowner consented to the illegal activity unless the contrary can be shown.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P>It should be noted that the maximum penalties attaching to illegal waste activities &mdash; &euro;15 million and-or a ten-year sentence &mdash; are substantial. Over &euro;7 million has been allocated from the environment fund to assist local authorities to act on such powers. The money is being used to support an increased emphasis on the overall environmental enforcement effort, with particular emphasis on combating dumping and other unauthorised waste activities. Wicklow County Council has received a grant of &euro;360,000 to enable it to employ seven additional waste enforcement workers.</P>
        <P>The Government has demonstrated the seriousness with which it views the incidence of illegal dumping. The Garda was asked to assist in the investigation of such activity in County Wicklow. A team from the national bureau of criminal investigation is involved in ongoing inquiries into such matters. On the civil side, Wicklow County Council is continuing to take the action it deems appropriate. Formal legal proceedings are being prepared in several instances. I am sure the House will acknowledge that the measures being undertaken will greatly help local authorities in tackling the problem of illegal waste activity. They are a testament to the priority the Government attaches to this matter.</P>

        <P>The mission is to support the comprehensive peace agreement for southern Sudan signed by the Government of Sudan and the SPLM-A, Sudan People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement-Army, in Nairobi on 9 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Ireland has been strongly supportive of the peace process in Sudan generally and also in the troubled region of Darfur, providing financial support to the African Union mission, AMIS, there as well as seconding an army officer to it.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also contributed considerable aid support to Sudan. Last week, Ireland announced that it will provide &euro;15 million for the recovery and reconstruction of Sudan for the period 2005 to 2007.</P><Col N="126"/>
        <P>Assessment of this request also needs to take into account the numbers of Permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service at present. We currently have 750 troops serving abroad out of a total of 850 maintained on UNSAS, UN standby arrangements system. This number can fluctuate; it was approximately 770 some months ago.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>Members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently serving overseas in eight UN missions: in Liberia &mdash; the current total is 416 &mdash; in C&ocirc;te d&rsquo;Ivoire, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Lebanon and the Middle East, as well as in multinational forces authorised by the Security Council, in Kosovo &mdash; there are 207, in Bosnia and Herzegovina &mdash; there are 54, and in Afghanistan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee presented their report The Challenge of a Workplace in March 2002. This independent report addressed the range of interpersonal issues within <Col N="127"/>the Defence Forces. Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the recommendations of the report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and my Department since its publication. An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of these recommendations.</P>
        <P>The independent monitoring group&rsquo;s progress report Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, launched by my predecessor on 24 September 2004 is available on the Defence Forces website and describes in detail the progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.</P>
        <P>Arising from the Doyle report, the following steps have been taken: firm guiding principles have been set out in the Defence Forces Dignity in the Workplace Charter; a major educational awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces; a new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003. The instruction and a users guide were distributed to every member of the Defence Forces; and some 177 of a planned 200 designated contact persons have been put in place throughout the organisation to facilitate the operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute a complaint. A course to qualify further personnel is anticipated in May-June 2005; an independent external confidential freefone helpline and counselling service was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003; an independent pilot project of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent Defence Force was conducted; leadership training has been given by external experts and has been the subject of NCO focus groups with emphasis on training the trainers; changes in cadet school instruction have been initiated and issues concerning the ranking, selection and training for cadet school instructors are being addressed; Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson; legislation to establish a Defence Forces Ombudsman completed all Stages in 2004; and an officer within the Defence Forces human resources management section has been assigned responsibility for equality matters.</P>
        <P>The chief of staff has repeatedly emphasised his acceptance of the problems indicated by the Doyle report. He has recognised the necessity to tackle this matter in a fundamental way at all levels of the Defence Forces and has demonstrated a very active and genuine commitment to change. He has emphasised that it is incumbent on all commanders to ensure that best practice in the management of personnel is fostered at all levels to eliminate the problems identified in the Doyle report.</P><Col N="128"/>
        <P>Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are constantly being communicated to all ranks. I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through education modules on interpersonal relationships now embedded in career courses for all ranks.</P>
        <P>I wish to reiterate that bullying is not training for anything. I fully realise that the project of bringing about necessary fundamental changes in attitudes and culture will not be quick or easy. However, with substantial and vigorous leadership, I have every confidence that the proper environment will be firmly established and maintained throughout the Defence Forces.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 37 together.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 33 aircraft in service with the Air Corps at present, comprising 14 helicopters and 19 fixed wing aircraft. The type and age of the aircraft is set out in the following tabular statement, which will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
        <P>In January 2005, two contracts were signed for the provision of new helicopters for the Air Corps at a cost of over &euro;61 million. Four Utility helicopters are being acquired from Bell Agusta Aerospace Company at a cost of &euro;48.4 million inclusive of VAT. Two will be delivered in 2006 and two in 2007.</P>
        <P>Two light Utility helicopters are being acquired from Eurocopter SAS at a cost of &euro;12.8 million inclusive of VAT. Both light Utility helicopters are due to be delivered later this year.</P>
        <P>The eight recently acquired Pilatus PC-9M turbo propeller aircraft have replaced seven Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These modern aircraft allow for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standards. These aircraft are capable of being armed giving the aircraft a limited defensive capability. Arrangements are being made within the Department for the disposal of the seven Marchetti aircraft by tender competition.</P>
        <P>A detailed service level agreement is currently being finalised between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Defence setting out the details of the specific <Col N="129"/>capabilities which the Air Corps will provide in respect of air ambulance services.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 31 together.</P>
        <P>The specific provision, within the corpus of Defence legislation, under which members of the Permanent Defence Force can be deployed overseas is contained in section 2 of the Defence Amendment (No. 2) Act 1960.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the above Act provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of a particular International United Nations Force if, but only if, a resolution has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of that International United Nations Force.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;International United Nations Force&rdquo; is defined in the Defence Amendment Act 1993 as &ldquo;an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The UN mandate for the force and the D&aacute;il resolution provided for in section 2 of the Defence Amendment (No. 2) Act 1960 form two elements of what has become known as the triple lock. The third element is the Government decision approving the dispatch of the contingent and the introduction of an appropriate resolution in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>Section 2(2) of the Defence Amendment (No. 2) Act 1960 provides that a contingent of the Defence Forces can serve overseas in the absence of a D&aacute;il resolution where the force is unarmed, where the contingent consists of no more than 12 members of the Permanent Defence Force, or where the contingent is intended to replace, in whole or in part, or reinforce an existing contingent.</P>
        <P>As I have stated on many occasions, both in response to questions in this House and in my public speeches, I have no plans to reform the current arrangements in relation to the triple lock.</P>

        <Quest>if he will report on the situation in Liberia; the strength of the Irish Defence Forces contingent serving there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12332/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Defence Forces contingent, which was deployed for service with the United Nations mission in <Col N="131"/>Liberia, UNMIL, in December 2003, currently comprises a motorised infantry battalion, of some 410 personnel. A small number of additional personnel have been also deployed at force headquarters and as military observers.</P>
        <P>Irish personnel are rotated on a six monthly basis. The 92nd infantry battalion, which consists of troops mainly from the southern brigade area, commenced a six month tour of duty in December 2004. The 93rd infantry battalion drawn from the western brigade will replace them in early June.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the quick reaction force, QRF, to the UNMIL force commander. I very much welcome the participation of Sweden as part of the QRF. This type of co-operation is reflective of the changing dynamics in peacekeeping. The range and diversity of arrangements now in place for peacekeeping allow us to work in tandem with like-minded nations to contribute in a very effective and meaningful manner to peace support operations throughout the world. The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.</P>
        <P>The Irish battalion in UNMIL has operated in a path-finding and reconnaissance role supporting the deployment of other UN contingents. It has also conducted long-range patrols beyond Monrovia and well into the interior of Liberia showing a UN presence, deterring lawlessness and protecting local populations. The contingent also undertakes regular daily patrols within the Monrovia area. The Irish battalion is available to the force commander to provide support and a rapid response capability in the event of a breakdown in law and order or further conflict. Additionally, the QRF is currently conducting patrols to support election profiling efforts for the forthcoming national elections to be held on the 11 October next.</P>
        <P>The situation in Liberia is currently assessed as calm. However, the speed with which these situations can get out of hand is indicative of the difficult circumstances in which our troops operate and one can never lose sight of this. We will continue to keep this situation under review to ensure that our troops have the necessary equipment and resources to discharge their mandate.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 26 and 32 together.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for the current D&aacute;il session which commenced on 12 April 2005, as announced by my colleague, the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, lists in section C my intention to seek Government approval to amend Part V (Discipline) of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, and certain other provisions of the Act.</P>
        <P>Since its enactment over 50 years ago, Part V (Discipline) of the Defence Act 1954 has been subject to relatively minor revisions, including the establishment in 1983 of the Courts-Martial Appeals Court, CMAC, the introduction of a special legal aid scheme, and some subsequent updating of the punishments available for breaches of military law.</P>
        <P>There have been relevant developments in the intervening period. The military legal authorities have had regard to various decisions of the Courts-Martial Appeals Court since 1983, to developments in the ordinary criminal courts of the State and to developments in the administration of military law in other common law jurisdictions. They have been especially aware of the need for the Irish military legal system to be fully compliant with all of the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights which was incorporated into Irish law through the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. In this regard, the military authorities are entirely cognisant of recent decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in the area of military law.</P>
        <P>In July 2001, the deputy chief of staff &mdash; support &mdash; convened a Military Law Review Board to review the current provisions of the Defence Act 1954, as amended, to ensure that the military law justice system is both expeditious and fair to the individual and contributes significantly to the maintenance of discipline within the Defence Forces and complies with the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The board report, together with legal advice from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, have been considered within my Department with a view to deciding upon the most suitable approach to be taken to the recommendations, in light of the general legislative programme of the Government.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, it is my intention to seek the approval of the Government, in the near future, for the urgent drafting of this amendment Bill on the lines of the general scheme which has been prepared by officials within my Department.</P>

        <Quest>his views on whether contingents of the Defence Forces should undertake joint training missions with other EU member state forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Defence Forces are deploying a contingent on an overseas mission and where contingent personnel are drawn from different brigades, they are trained together for a period, in order to improve cohesiveness and understanding among the personnel comprising the contingent. Similarly, from an objective standpoint, it will be important, in order to reach the requisite level of interoperability within the short timeframes envisaged for the deployment of the EU&rsquo;s rapid reaction elements, that the various forces and elements comprising a battle group are familiar with the equipment, standard operating procedures, organisation and operations of the group as a whole.</P>
        <P>The development of this essential understanding and interoperability is one of the factors involved in Ireland&rsquo;s individual partnership programme, IPP, under Partnership for Peace, PfP. Ireland also participates in the PfP planning and review process, known as PARP. In common with the other EU neutrals, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management collectively known as the Petersberg Tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.</P>
        <P>It is Government policy to stay in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PfP enables our peacekeepers to remain abreast of developments in preparation for peacekeeping in areas such as training, humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping and interoperability and enhances the ability of our peacekeepers to work with those of other countries. It also enables us to share our own peacekeeping skills with a wide range of countries. We want to ensure that our Defence Forces have a full voice in preparations for peacekeeping missions and we do not want to see Ireland absent when matters in which we have a legitimate interest are being discussed.</P>
        <P>Defence Forces personnel have participated in a number of staff, technical and crisis management exercises in the context of both the EU and PfP. In accordance with stated policy, the Defence Forces do not participate in multinational military field exercises. However, from an optimum readiness perspective, this may need to change if we wish to participate fully and effectively in EU battle groups-rapid response elements. The question of joint training missions with the forces of other member states is among the issues being reviewed by the interdepartmental group I have established to exam<Col N="134"/>ine full implications of Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in EU rapid reaction elements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 30, 34, 43, 244 to 247, inclusive, 256 and 257 together.</P>
        <P>The background to the rapid response elements concept, commonly referred to as battle groups, is that at the European Council in Helsinki in 1999 member states set themselves a headline goal that &ldquo;by the year 2003, cooperating together and voluntarily, they will be able to deploy rapidly and then sustain forces capable of the full range of Petersberg Tasks as set out in the Amsterdam Treaty&rdquo;. In short, they are humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management operations, including peacemaking. This included, <i>inter alia</i>, a capability to provide &ldquo;rapid response elements available and deployable at very high readiness&rdquo;. The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has and continues to be a key objective of the development of the European security and defence policy.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in such operations is entirely consistent with our foreign policy commitment to collective security which recognises the primary role of the UN Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security and our tradition of support for the United Nations. This is a position endorsed by the UN Secretary General who recognises and supports the development of EU rapid reaction elements as a key factor in enabling the UN to respond more rapidly and with greater authority to emerging crises. During his visit to Dublin in October 2004, the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, stressed the importance of battle groups and requested Ireland&rsquo;s support for them.</P>
        <P>At the Cabinet meeting of 16 November, the Government agreed that I should advise my EU counterparts of Ireland&rsquo;s preparedness to enter into consultations with partners with a view to potential participation in rapid response elements. A military capabilities commitment conference was held on 22 November 2004 at which member states committed up to 13 battle group formations which will be available to deploy to crisis situations within a five to ten day period from 2005 onwards.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports the development of the EU&rsquo;s rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. However, it is important that the full implications of our participation are assessed and, to this end, I have established an interdepartmental group which includes representatives of my Department, the Defence Forces, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. This group met in December and has established three subgroups to address the policy, legislative and operational issues arising. These groups are now working on position papers in relation to the var<Col N="136"/>ious issues related to Ireland&rsquo;s potential participation in EU rapid response elements. This is a detailed and complex task and it is expected that the work of the subgroups will span several months, not least because the rapid response elements concept is still evolving and a complete picture of all other member states&rsquo; proposed involvement is not yet available. Following completion of the necessary analysis, I intend returning to Government with proposals regarding the level of any proposed participation by Ireland. Pending the completion of this analysis and a decision by the Government on the issue, the question of issuing directions or guidelines to the Defence Forces regarding the formation of, or Ireland&rsquo;s participation in, EU rapid response elements does not arise and, as such, there are no consultations ongoing currently between the Defence Forces and their European colleagues in this regard.</P>
        <P>As I have said repeatedly inside and outside this House, Ireland&rsquo;s participation in rapid response elements will remain subject to the usual requirements of a Government decision, D&aacute;il approval and UN authorisation and I have no plans to do away with the triple lock mechanism as the legal basis for our participation in overseas peace support operations.</P>
        <P>It is likely that any crisis on which the EU rapid reaction elements might be deployed will evolve over some time, thus allowing time for the formulation of the requisite UN Security Council resolution.</P>

	<P>The Defence Forces participate in two main types of overseas missions, namely, traditional UN-led &ldquo;Blue Hat&rdquo; missions and UN authorised missions, where the mission is established under the authority of the UN Security Council or the General Assembly of the UN. UNIFIL in Lebanon and UNMIL in Liberia are examples of such missions. The second type are missions authorised to be established by the Security Council of the United Nations or the UN General Assembly. KFOR in Kosovo, EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina and ISAF in Afghanistan are examples of such missions, where a regional organisation, such as NATO or the EU, assembles the force and deploys it under the authorisation of the UN. Chapter VIII of the original charter of the United Nations, Article 53 in particular, makes provision for situations whereby the UN authorises <Col N="137"/>regional organisations to undertake missions under the authority of the UN.</P>

	<P>As soon as the scale of the recent disaster in South East Asia became clear, the Department of Foreign Affairs deployed a high-level technical assessment team, which included a member of the Defence Forces, to examine the situation on the ground and identify what assistance Ireland should offer to the affected region. Arising from its initial assessment, the team advised the Department of Foreign Affairs of an immediate requirement for two logistics planning experts and two engineers to be attached to the United Nations Joint Logistics Centre, UNJLC.</P>
        <P>Four officers of the Permanent Defence Force were seconded, with effect from 18 January 2005 on a volunteer basis to the UNJLC in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The primary role of these personnel was to report to the UNJLC, following a detailed analysis of key priorities within their fields of expertise. The role of the logistics officers was to evaluate, on behalf of the UNJLC, the current and future transport requirements in the affected areas for the delivery of humanitarian aid and to recommend solutions to overcome any identified <Col N="138"/>shortfalls. The role of the engineers was to examine the road infrastructure in the affected areas, specify the rehabilitation and repair requirements and establish repair priorities so as to restore a functioning transport network in the area.</P>
        <P>At the request of the UNJLC, an assessment of transport and logistics requirements in the north and north-east of the country was conducted. In addition, the engineers completed a full and detailed analysis of the south and south-east coastal road system. All four officers have since completed their work with the UNJLC and have returned home to Ireland.</P>
        <P>No further requests for Defence Forces assistance have been received. However, in the event that the Defence Forces have the capacity and resources to offer further required assistance in the region in specified roles, this will be examined on a case-by-case basis having regard to the requirements and the situation on the ground. I can assure Deputies that the Government is very positively disposed towards supporting the relief effort in the affected areas to the greatest possible extent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, due to illness, I was unable to attend the informal meeting of EU Defence Ministers convened by the Luxembourg Presidency and the Secretary General of my Department attended in my place.</P>
        <P>As previously reported to the House, these meetings provide a useful forum for Ministers to exchange views on the continued development of the European security and defence policy, ESDP, in particular the development of EU capabilities to carry out Petersberg Task operations and to ensure that the work on headline goal 2010 may be completed within the UK Presidency.</P>
        <P>The first item on the agenda was a discussion on the situation in the western Balkans and Operation Althea. The operational commander gave a brief on the current situation and the Secretary General High Representative Solana expressed satisfaction with the conduct of Operation Althea to date, mentioning, in particular, co-operation <Col N="140"/>with the international tribunal where 11 people had surrendered.</P>
        <P>Discussions then turned to the various aspects of military capabilities development, particularly in relation to the rapid response elements &mdash; battle groups &mdash; concept.</P>
        <P>The situation in Sudan and the contribution of the EU to the AU operation in Darfur was also discussed. Up to one third of the 750 military observers, foreseen as part of the new UN operation that will monitor implementation of the N-S Naivasha Accord, are expected to come from EU member states. At the same time, the EU will continue to provide support to the AU operation in Darfur.</P>
        <P>The disaster following the tsunami in south-east Asia was then discussed. Many member states had supplied capabilities on an individual country basis in response to the tsunami. The challenge now is to see how the EU could respond collectively in a co-ordinated and structure manner. Secretary General High Representative Solana set out the general parameters for the military role that ESDP could play in the type of scenario presented by the Asian tsunami, in support of the EU&rsquo;s overall response to such disasters and in support of the civilian emergency disaster response elements.</P>

        <Quest>if the Defence Act 1954, Chapter III, section 85 allows members of the Defence Forces serving on a State ship or service aircraft to operate outside <Col N="141"/>the State without a UN mandate; if members of the Defence Forces could serve abroad without a UN mandate if they volunteered to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Section 85 applies only to members of the Permanent Defence Force employed on a State ship or service aircraft which is travelling outside the territorial seas of the State. State ships or aircraft have not been deployed on service with the United Nations or other international organisations.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The specific provision, within the corpus of defence legislation, under which members of the Permanent Defence Force can be deployed overseas is contained in section 2 of the Defence Amendment (No. 2) Act 1960.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the above Act provides that a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force may be despatched for service outside the State as part of a particular international United Nations force if, but only if, a resolution has been passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service outside the State as part of that international United Nations force. D&aacute;il approval is not required for the dispatch of a contingent where the size of a Defence Forces contribution is fewer than twelve personnel.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;International United Nations Force&rdquo; is defined in the Defence Amendment Act 1993, as &ldquo;an international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations&rdquo;.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 40 together.</P>
        <P>The most important defence against any terrorist attacks is detection and prevention by the security forces. While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The various components of the <Col N="142"/>Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.</P>
        <P>The level of any terrorist threat to Ireland is continually assessed. The advice available to me would suggest that while the terrorist threat to parts of Europe is currently high, in relation to Ireland, it is low. However it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September. It included, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment, intensive contacts with other State agencies, a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.</P>
        <P>The most important defence against any attack is of course external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.</P>

	<P>The central issue here, raised on 1 March 2005 is currently being examined by my officials in order to address the particular difficulty outlined by the Deputy. I understand that in practice cases such as this only arise infrequently. Nevertheless, I feel that we must provide compassionately for these cases administratively on an individual basis in order to avoid the imposition of unjustifiable hardship. At this stage, I do not envisage any requirement to change the provisions of the relevant Defence Force regulations with specific regard to the period within which a recruit must reach the appropriate standard for final approval. These provisions were outlined in my reply of 1 March 2005.</P>

        <P>In each brigade and the Defence Forces training centre, a CBRN platoon is fully trained in all aspects of nuclear decontamination to cater for battalion operations. The Defence Forces CBRN training for 2004 culminated in a major internal exercise in November 2004.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to <Col N="144"/>time. They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements and have been trained in their operation. Other Defence Forces equipment includes biological agent detectors and screening kits, group decontamination equipment and personal decontamination equipment.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State. In co-operation with the Defence Forces, it continuously monitors the potential threats to the State arising from international terrorism.</P>
        <P>The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years PDFORRA has canvassed the idea that a soldier&rsquo;s conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally.</P>
        <P>It is an inherent and overriding principle of military service that personnel are at all times subject to military law. The application of legislation intended primarily for the civilian worker would be totally contrary to this principle and could have grave fundamental organisational and operational implications for the efficiency and effectiveness of the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>That said, the Defence Forces have been included within the scope of employee protection legislation where appropriate, for example, health and safety legislation. Moreover, the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 was enacted last year and I am in the process of providing an Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that when an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts, <i>inter alia</i>, a range of obligations and responsibilities which do not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. For instance, the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the mechanisms available to the representative associations through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme, with its access to facilitation and arbitration and parallel discussions during national pay talks, provide a framework within which issues of concern can, are and should continue to be addressed. It is also worth noting that the Defence Act provides for a complaints procedure whereby if a member considers that he or she has been wronged, he or she may make a complaint in the matter and seek a redress.</P>

	<P>The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I chair, was established in October 2001. The membership of the task force includes Ministers, senior officials of Departments, senior officers of the Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and officials of other key public authorities that have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning. The work of the task force continues and there have been 37 meetings to date. The most recent meeting was on 2 March 2005. I have convened the next task force meeting for 26 April 2005 and further meetings will be held on a regular basis as required.</P>
        <P>The Office of Emergency Planning was established, following a Government decision in <Col N="146"/>October 2001, as a joint civil and military office within my Department. The office supports the work of the task force and continues to work with Departments and other public authorities in order to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements. A key area of activity is oversight of emergency planning; to refine and develop the arrangements that exist, to continuously improve them through review and revision: and to generally provide the basis for an increased confidence in the emergency planning process.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental working group on emergency planning supports the work of the task force and carries out studies and oversight of emergency planning structures and processes. This working group has met on 34 occasions, most recently on 7 April 2005 and it will continue to meet on a regular basis as required.</P>
        <P>The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning encompasses all Departments with lead roles in the various Government emergency plans and those key public authorities, including the Defence Forces, which plan to support such activities. This working group, under the guidance of the Government task force, continues to meet and is chaired by the office of emergency planning. It is a forum for developing strategic guidance to all those involved in emergency planning and for sharing information on emergency planning.</P>

The HSE looks to build on the arrangements that already exist, learn from the experiences of how involvement can be best achieved and develop an improved model of participation for the future.</P>
        <P>Pending the full development of the executive&rsquo;s service directorates the structures in each former health board area to support voluntary and community involvement remain under the leadership of a chief officer. The executive has indicated that there will be no change to these arrangements unless or until there is an improved model to replace them. In the context of approving the national service plan submitted by the executive, I pointed to the need to ensure that the strong existing relationships with the non-statutory sector are maintained and supported while the executive&rsquo;s new organisational design is being fully developed.</P>

	<P>The rollout of the national breast screening programme to the remaining counties is a major priority in the development of cancer services. This will ensure that all women in the relevant age group in every county have access to breast screening and follow up treatment where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Design briefs for the BreastCheck static units at South Infirmary, Victoria Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital, Galway have been completed. The advertisement for the appointment of a design team will be placed in the <i>EU Journal</i> shortly. I am confident that the target date of 2007 for the expansion of BreastCheck nationally will be met. Any woman irrespective of her age or residence who has immediate concerns or symptoms should consult her GP, who where appropriate will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>
        <P>The national cancer forum, a multi-disciplinary group of cancer experts, as part of the preparation of a new national cancer strategy has reviewed all issues concerned with screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate cancer. The forum will advise that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country. The forum will also advise that emerging international evidence on prostate screening should be kept under review. This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which do not provide a specific recommendation for prostate screening. It advocates the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and which reflect priority setting for healthcare resources.</P>

	<P>The submission requested that medical cards be granted at age 66 without a means test. Eligibility for health services is generally based on residency and means and the only major exception is for persons aged 70 and over, who have automatic eligibility to a medical card. Persons are entitled to a medical card where they are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves or their dependants. In determining eligibility the local area of the Health Service Executive will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant. Medical cards may be made available by the Health Service Executive where the income guidelines are exceeded, for example in circumstances where there are particular needs for medical services or in hardship cases. However, in all cases the decision is a matter for the chief officer of the relevant area of the Health Service Executive. The Government is fully committed to the extension of medical card coverage as set out <Col N="155"/>in the health strategy and will continue to focus on people with low incomes.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for maternity leave in public bodies under the aegis of my Department provide for a period of 18 weeks paid leave with the option for up to an additional eight weeks unpaid leave in line with the provisions set out in the Maternity Protection Act 2004. In addition, unpaid parental leave of up to 14 weeks is available to parents of children up to eight years or up to 16 years in the case of a child with a disability.</P>
        <P>As there are at present no plans to introduce an additional eight weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave or six weeks&rsquo; paid parental leave, no analysis has been undertaken by my Department on the likely cost of any such initiative. Any such expansion of these entitlements to bodies under the aegis of my Department in the future would most likely be considered only in the context of a similar expansion for the wider public service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 to 83, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the health public capital programme within my Department rests primarily with the hospital planning office supported as appropriate by other relevant divisions. The hospital planning office has 24 staff. While the day to day management of projects in the public capital programme rests with the Health Service Executive and other agencies, my Department works closely with these bodies and provides professional advice and support as appropriate. The future role and responsibilities of the hospital planning office are currently under review in the context of the reforms of the health service and recent establishment of the HSE. I will ensure that my Department has adequate resources in the future to undertake its responsibilities to the health capital programme.</P>
        <P>On the other issues raised, the Deputy will be aware that the HSE, which was established on 1 January 2005, has responsibility to manage and deliver health services at local level or arrange to have such services delivered on its behalf. The question of redeploying public servants within the HSE to procure infrastructure projects is a matter for decision by the executive in the context of its overall resources.</P>

	<P>The role of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, is to advise Departments about the optimal means of financing the cost of capital projects in order to achieve value for money, whether procured through a PPP approach or through traditional procurement. Departments and agencies who are decision making bodies are obliged to seek the advice of the NDFA for all capital projects or grouped projects valued in excess of &euro;20 million. For projects valued under that amount the advice of the agency may be sought but is not obligatory. The NDFA does not have a project approval role. The functions of the NDFA, which was established on 1 January 2003, are performed through the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, under section 11 of the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002. The NTMA has 90 full-time employees. I am advised by the NDFA that under section 11(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act the NTMA allocated the following full time staff to the NDFA since its inception.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I am advised that the NDFA only employs financial advisers to assist on high value projects where it is deemed necessary to have additional resources to help bring the project to financial close in a timely manner. For the criminal courts complex and the national conference centre, KPMG and Farrell Grant Sparks were appointed by NDFA on this basis following tender competitions. The main work of the financial advisers is to aid in the calculation of the public sector benchmark and the evaluation of bids.</P>
        <P>Following the establishment of the NDFA my Department advised all Departments that State authorities were to seek the advice of the agency on the best financing approach for projects. However, where a Department, State authority or agency had employed financial consultants to provide advice for an individual project or a programme of projects these arrangements would be honoured. The NDFA where requested has also worked with those authorities and their advisers to help assess the best value for money for the Exchequer. The NDFA has not conducted any formal consultancy studies or reports to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to developing the PPP process as a viable procurement option for appropriate projects within the overall context of public <Col N="164"/>investment in infrastructure and public services. PPPs are one procurement tool to be used alongside traditional approaches. The PPP procurement option, however, has an important role to play when applied to appropriate projects where there is the right scale, risk and operational profile to harness the benefits of this new approach.</P>
        <P>There has been good progress on PPPs overall since the first group of pilot projects were announced in 1999. Reasonable deal flow has been established in the roads and environment areas but progress in relation to projects funded by unitary payments from the Exchequer has been slower. We are still learning and continue to keep our processes and procedures under review.</P>
        <P>In that context, I am actively considering what changes, if any, are appropriate to support the continued evolution of the process for projects funded by unitary payments from the Exchequer. PPPs are acknowledged to be complex, involving as they do a long-term financial commitment for both the private and public sector partners. Significant effort is also required up-front in scoping and negotiating the projects. Building on the lessons learnt to date and on the progress and expertise already developed, one of the challenges going forward is to determine how best to ensure that the appropriate skills and capacity are in place to assist Departments in procuring PPP projects. I am currently considering that issue and my intention is to have that process concluded as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has taken no decision as yet as to whether there will be a successor to the current seven year national development plan which will run until the end of 2006. Unlike previous occasions there is no requirement under the draft Structural Funds regulations for the period 2007-13 to prepare a national development plan. The introduction of the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes in budget 2004 was a major innovation and provides a medium-term financial framework for public capital investment. This gives Departments and implementing agencies relative financial certainty to plan capital programmes and projects over the medium-term. I will be examining whether the capital envelopes need to be augmented through a post-2006 national development plan and will make my recommendations to Government in this regard in due course.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 to 93, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>On the totality of public capital programmes and projects, as the Deputy will appreciate, primary responsibility for managing capital programmes and the evaluation, planning and execution of infrastructure projects rests with line Departments and the relevant implementing agencies. This includes addressing capacity and resource requirements for programme and project management and delivery.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance&rsquo;s role is to agree with Departments, subject to the direction of the Government, the policy framework for capital programmes and projects, to make global provision through the multi-annual capital envelopes for the resources required and to put in place best practice guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital projects.</P>
        <P>Line Departments and their agencies are primarily responsible for managing their programmes and projects within budget and in compliance with the policy framework and with guidelines laid down by my Department. In general, therefore, most Departments have delegated sanction to execute projects. My Department has a role in the sanctioning of resources for individual projects not covered by the delegated sanction given to line Departments or not within approved programme budgets. Line Departments in turn, generally act as the sanctioning authority for projects promoted by public bodies under their aegis.</P>
        <P>On its own capital expenditure, my Department, given the nature of its business, has very little direct involvement in infrastructure projects. Information on those projects for which my Department is directly responsible, is outlined in this response. In line with the capital investment framework, my Department makes five year projections on an annual rolling basis in respect of the capital requirements on its Vote. Most of the funding is allocated for use by other Departments or bodies. In this context, these are the projected capital requirements for 2005-09: 2005 &mdash;&euro;11.108 million; 2006 &mdash;&euro;9.088 million; 2007 &mdash;&euro;9.363 million; 2008 &mdash; 9.363 million; and 2009 &mdash; 9.363 million.</P>
        <P>Given the eclectic nature of the capital programmes funded from my Department&rsquo;s Vote, <Col N="167"/>funding requirements over ten years, as requested by the Deputy cannot be predicted but I do not anticipate any capital projects in excess of &euro;20 million.</P>
        <P>Details of capital projects, including staffing, for which my Department is directly responsible, are outlined below.</P>
        <P>Subhead P &mdash; The Information Society fund provides a central mechanism to support Civil Service-wide e-Government requirements and also to respond to opportunities under the Government&rsquo;s new action plan for the information society, &ldquo;New Connections&rdquo;, approved in March 2003. To date, capital projects funded from the information society fund have not been managed by my Department. One person is employed assessing project proposals to the information society fund from other Departments.</P>
        <P>My Department is considering a proposal on a human resource management system in 2005. If successful this will be the first capital project managed by my Department from funds provided from the information society fund. It is expected that the project will be completed by 2007. No advisers or consultants have been engaged in respect of the proposed capital project to be managed by my Department and no reports have been created. The project would not involve user charges.</P>
        <P>Subhead Q &mdash; Civil Service Childcare Initiative provides cr&egrave;ches for the children of civil servants in Dublin and regional centres. The project was first proposed and considered in budget 2001. The project is ongoing and will be complete when cr&egrave;ches have been provided in main centres of civil service population. No public servants are employed full-time on the project. The OPW has advised me on the project and no consultancy reports arise from the project and to date &euro;4.396 million has been spent on the provision and fitting out of six cr&egrave;ches. User fees are charged by the operators of the facilities.</P>
        <P>Subhead R &mdash; Procurement Management Reform provides for the implementation of the strategy for the implementation of e-procurement in the Irish public sector, which comprises procurement management reform including the establishment of a number of e-procurement systems, such as a tender management facility, a public procurement portal, electronic catalogue/s and a supplier register. The project was first considered in 2003 and is expected to be completed in 2009. To date &euro;350,000 has been spent. One and a half public servants are employed in my Department managing the project. User fees will not be charged for the project. Currently, Millstream Associates and Fusio Limited act as consultants on the project and a document entitled Technical review of the e-tenders website 2003 has been prepared.</P>
        <P>The number of public servants employed by my Department in a full-time capacity to assess, procure, project manage, or deliver capital projects <Col N="168"/>is sufficient for the task and as such I have not considered redeploying staff within my Department. These projects have not given rise to meetings between me or my predecessors and persons in the private sector. Information on any consultancy advice received on these projects is as outlined above.</P>
        <P>On the Office of Public Works, which is not funded directly or indirectly by my Department, my Department has asked that office to communicate to the Deputy the required information on its infrastructure projects, as it was not possible to include the information in this response in the time available.</P>

        <Quest>the arrangements for maternity leave within the public sector; if he will consider providing an additional eight weeks paid leave in regard to maternity leave; the likely cost thereof; the likely cost to the Exchequer of six weeks&rsquo; paid parental leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12004/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The arrangements for maternity leave for civil servants come within my area of responsibility. Arrangements in other parts of the public service are the responsibility of the appropriate Minister.</P>
        <P>Under maternity protection legislation all employees are entitled to 18 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave and eight weeks&rsquo; additional unpaid maternity leave. Maternity benefit is payable to employees for the 18 weeks&rsquo; maternity leave where they meet certain social insurance conditions on their own insurance record.</P><Col N="170"/>
        <P>Current arrangements for civil servants entitle the majority of women to their normal rate of pay while on maternity leave, irrespective of whether they qualify for maternity benefit. No payment is made in respect of an absence on additional maternity leave.</P>
        <P>The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 introduced a wide range of improvements to maternity protection legislation. These include paid time off for a full set of ante-natal classes for mothers and paid time off for two ante-natal classes for fathers, provision to cancel additional unpaid maternity leave in order to move to sick leave in the event of the illness of the mother, postponement of leave in the event of the hospitalisation of the child and the introduction of paid breast-feeding breaks. These improvements, while welcome, will increase costs in the Civil Service, as they will for all employers, and there are no plans for any further improvements to the Civil Service maternity leave arrangements at present.</P>
        <P>As regards an estimate of costs, there are approximately 700 instances of maternity leave among civil servants each year. The value of an additional eight weeks paid maternity leave, if staff were paid their normal rate of pay, would be approximately &euro;4 million extra each year.</P>
        <P>An estimate was provided by the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 in its report published on 29 April 2002. The group estimated that the cost to the public sector of 14 weeks parental leave at full pay, similar to maternity leave, would amount to &euro;50.5 million based on 2001 costs. At current costs the figure would be approximately &euro;60.6 million. On this basis the likely cost to the public sector of six weeks&rsquo; paid parental leave at current costs would be approximately &euro;26 million depending on uptake.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested to note that fathers in the Civil Service are entitled to three days&rsquo; paid paternity leave on the birth or adoption of their child. In 2003 approximately 300 fathers availed of this leave.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the budget submission made to Government on behalf of the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland relative to his Department; and if she will make a statement on the issues raised.</Quest>
        <QRef>[12629/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issues raised in the submission from the Retired Nurses Association that are within my area of responsibility, while superannuation benefits of nurses are a matter for the Minister for Health and Children in the first instance, the position for public service pensions generally is that prior to 31 July 1973 the law required that female employees had to resign on marriage. In such cases, employees under pension age qualified for marriage gratuities.</P><Col N="171"/>
        <P>While it is accepted that the particular requirement would not pertain today, I have no plans to change the Superannuation Acts to provide pensions for officers who resigned on marriage before 1973. Any decision to provide pensions for officials who resigned on marriage before 1973 would also have wide ramifications in terms of policy and costs for employees who left the public service before the introduction of preserved pension entitlements in the 1970s.</P>
        <P>Point 3 proposes that a pension paid to a retiree should transfer in full to a surviving spouse, particularly in the case of the widow&rsquo;s and orphan&rsquo;s scheme. It is not clear from the submission whether social welfare pensions or occupational schemes are being referred to. If the latter, entitlements are a matter for the trustees in the case of private sector schemes and the State in the case of public sector. In 2002, the then Minister for Finance amended the approval conditions for taxation purposes for these occupational schemes so that spouse-dependant pensions could be the same in aggregate as the employee&rsquo;s entitlement.</P>
        <P>Spouses and children&rsquo;s schemes in the public service generally give the surviving spouses of members a pension equal to one half of the member&rsquo;s pension, except in the case of the member dying in service or retiring on health grounds, when the pension payable is one half of the pension which would have been paid to the member had the member served to maximum retiring age. There are no plans to increase the rate of spouses&rsquo; pension payable in public sector schemes.</P>
        <P>Point 6 proposes that retired people be exempted from VAT on phone charges. The rate of VAT that applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service and not by the status of the customer. Telecommunications services, including phones, are subject to the standard rate of VAT at 21%. There is no provision in European VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, that would allow the application of an exemption from VAT for supplies to customers who are retired.</P>
        <P>My colleagues, the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children will deal with the other issues raised in the submission.</P>

	<P>The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network, including provision of further Government services, remains with An Post. While the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion, with a &euro;12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for An Post to enhance existing services and, building on existing strengths, to develop new product offerings.</P>

It would not be possible at this short notice to include a stamp to honour Pope John Paul II this year but the proposal could be considered in future commemorative stamp programmes.</P>
        <P>A series of three stamps was issued in October 2003 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the election of Pope John Paul II.</P>

	<P>Both Cork County Council and Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour Board have been previously advised that the allocation in this Department in respect of the national development plan is limited, and accordingly, the Department has not been in a position to announce grant aid approvals in respect of the development of regional harbours.</P>
        <P>Talks were recently held with officials from Cork County Council and members of the Baltimore Harbour Commissioners, at their request, to discuss funding to carry out a hydrographic survey at Baltimore Harbour. I wish to clarify that there is no commitment from my Department to provide funding for this project.</P>
        <P>As was recently indicated in the ports policy statement, published in January 2005, Baltimore Harbour is one of the ten regional harbours scheduled for transfer to the relevant local authority.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>Officials from the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are at present considering the modalities for the transfer of the regional harbours to local authority ownership.</P>
        <P>As part of that process, the local authorities concerned will shortly be asked to carry out a thorough assessment, with the co-operation of the relevant harbour authorities, and report on the potential for and possible timing of the proposed transfers in each case.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 to 113, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the ESB commissions a brown eel-monitoring programme on the Shannon under the scientific direction of NUI Galway. The purpose of this programme is to ensure that eel stocks are monitored and conserved in accordance with best practice. The ESB <Col N="176"/>has no commercial interest in the disposal of any eels caught as part of the brown eel programme.</P>
        <P>A contractor is employed to remove the eels at Killaloe, where the ESB operates eel weirs, to protect them from potential damage from the turbines at Ardnacrusha. A large proportion of the eels removed are reintroduced to the river beyond the turbines to ensure adequate escapement for spawning.</P>
        <P>The extraction of eels at Killaloe is carried out by contract under normal ESB tendering arrangements. Juvenile eels reaching the dam at Ardnacrusha are called elvers. It is the responsibility of the ESB to ensure that juvenile eels can access the Shannon catchment above the hydropower station at Ardnacrusha.</P>
        <P>The ESB has undertaken a number of programmes to facilitate the capture and distribution of glass or juvenile eels. In recent years licences have issued only to the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board in partnership with the ESB to capture juvenile eels.</P>
        <P>The ESB, in partnership with the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, has sought in recent years to trap glass eels and elvers, by a variety of experimental means, in the Shannon estuary and transport them upstream to assist in the restocking of the upper Shannon. The ESB also has a trap at the hydropower station at Ardnacrusha at which they trap elvers.</P>
        <P>Glass eel and elvers returning to the Shannon have been in decline in recent years, as is the case throughout Europe, and therefore the numbers of juvenile eels caught is down. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the ESB will review their juvenile eels programme in advance of the 2005-06 season.</P>
        <P>It is illegal to sell glass eels or elvers in Ireland. I am advised by the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and the ESB that neither organisation is aware of any evidence which suggests that glass eels or elvers are being supplied to the commercial market.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of any reason the Department should investigate the activities of the company referred to by the Deputy, which ceased trading in 1996.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the fish stocks in Lough Allen south due to the disposal of liquids from an industrial unit (details supplied) in County Leitrim to a sewage treatment works at Drumshanbo owned and operated by Leitrim County Council; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has primary responsibility for policy and legislation on water quality issues. Statutory responsibility for water management and protec<Col N="177"/>tion rests primarily with the local authorities. The central and regional fisheries boards have responsibility for the conservation and management of fish stocks.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board is aware of the reports of effluent emanating from Leitrim County Council&rsquo;s sewage treatment plant at Drumshanbo. However, it is not aware of any adverse effects on fish stocks in the area as a result of treated effluent from this plant. The board has been in contact with Leitrim County Council and has been assured that the waste from the industrial unit, referred to by the Deputy, is treated before it enters the lake in the normal manner. I am advised that Leitrim County Council has carried out toxicity tests which have proven negative. Further toxicity tests are to be carried out and when the results become available to the board they will be reviewed and any necessary action taken.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the Environmental Protection Agency has licensed the waste discharges from the industrial unit and is aware of the discharge to Leitrim County Council&rsquo;s sewage treatment plant. While no stock assessment has been undertaken on Lough Allen the board has carried out fish stock surveys on the Shannon at Carrick-on-Shannon, seven miles downstream of Lough Allen, in 2004 and downstream of Carrick-on-Shannon in 2003 including the site of the industrial unit. These surveys have shown good stocks of coarse fish present. The board is working with Leitrim County Council on a cross-Border proposal to survey a number of waters in the Leitrim area. It anticipates a decision on this project soon. The board will continue to work with the other State bodies to monitor the situation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 to 118, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The infrastructure project areas in the public capital programme within the Department&rsquo;s remit are shown in the following table. The assessment, procurement, project management and delivery of infrastructure projects are carried out by my Department and the bodies under its aegis in line with relevant public financial provisions and conditions, including EU requirements. The management of infrastructure projects in the public capital programme within the Department&rsquo;s remit is undertaken variously by staff in the Department, the commercial State bodies and the non-commercial State bodies. The level of resource deployment depends on a number of considerations such as the nature of the project, funding conditions and management requirements. The assessment, procurement, project management and delivery of infrastructure projects are conducted by staff as part of their overall roles agreed with management, which reflect Government policy, strategy statements and the business plans of the Department and the agencies concerned.</P>
        <P>In some cases staff are working mainly or predominantly on infrastructure project delivery. Any review of the scope for redeploying additional public servants to particular infrastructure projects would need to be based on objective business cases and in the context of Government policy on public service numbers. Staff deployment within my Department is kept under review in the light of Government programme priorities, the national development plan, the Department&rsquo;s strategy statements, business plans, organis<Col N="179"/>ational priorities and other factors including the decentralisation programme. The multi-annual capital framework, which includes a facility to plan for carry-over of unspent Exchequer capital to the following year, is designed to give Departments and agencies more certainty in relation to <Col N="180"/>available resources over the medium term and more flexibility to plan and manage their capital programmes in terms of delivery of outputs. The multi-annual framework will also enable Departments and agencies to plan the deployment of staffing resources on capital projects more efficiently and effectively over the medium term.</P><Col N="179"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 133 to 136, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In February 2002 the Government approved, in principle, the capital redevelopment of the national theatre to provide enhanced premises and facilities. The OPW has been engaged in an examination of possible locations for the redevelopment of the Abbey. It is only when a suitable <Col N="183"/>site is acquired and details of the parameters of the project are determined, including design and any partnership with the private sector etc. that a timeframe for completion, consultants, numbers of public servants involved, costs and financing arrangements may be known. The OPW has commissioned two external consultancies in relation to the Abbey, a report by Theatreplan Ltd, commissioned in July 2001, and the National Theatre-Col&aacute;iste Mhuire site assessment by Gilroy McMahon Architects, commissioned in February 2005. The costs of the studies have been incurred by the OPW.</P>
        <P>The space and accommodation comprising the National Concert Hall is deficient in a number of important aspects most notably the absence of a self-contained auditorium for performances before smaller audiences and totally inadequate backstage facilities. In recognition of these deficiencies, the programme for Government includes a commitment to the long-term strategic development of the National Concert Hall. A number of possible locations were examined by OPW for the National Concert Hall in recent years. Consideration is being given to the possibility of redeveloping the Earlsfort Terrace site on its vacation by UCD. The elements of the National Concert Hall project remain under discussion. When these are finalised, Government approval will be sought. Two firms of consultants have been engaged by the OPW to draw up and inform a feasibility study on the Earlsfort Terrace site. They are Hopkins Architects, which was paid a total of &euro;41,803.48 to produce a report, National Concert Hall, Dublin &mdash; Feasibility Study, in March 2004, and Carr and Angier, which was paid a total of &euro;9,057.90 to produce a report, Outline Brief and Schedule of Accommodation, in 2002. The total fees paid to consultants for the above was &euro;50,861.38.</P>
        <P>In June 2003, the Government agreed, in principle, to the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin through an open competitive procurement process. The project is being procured as a public private partnership by the Office of Public Works under the direction of the steering group chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. In November 2003, the OPW published a notice inviting expressions of interest in the provision of a national conference centre in the Dublin area on a site to be provided by the interested party with an expected minimum delegate capacity of the order of 2,000. Four submissions were received and following detailed evaluation, three candidates were short-listed to proceed to the next stage of the competition and issued with invitations to tender for the project. One having withdrawn, the competition is proceeding on the basis of two tenderers.</P>
        <P>Allowing sufficient time for engagement with the tenderers, it is hoped that a provisional preferred tenderer will be selected by mid-year, with the award of the contract, subject to Government <Col N="184"/>approval, following later. The provision of the national conference centre project is being pursued under a design, build, finance, operate and maintain arrangement. It is intended that financing details will be addressed in the tenders. Staffing and the engagement of consultants associated with the project are matters for the Office of Public Works and others advising on the project, such as the National Development Finance Agency and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. In addition to my Department, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Finance and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are represented on the national conference centre steering group. These bodies, together with the NDFA, are also represented on the project team, which is chaired by the Office of Public Works. No specific expenditure has been incurred by my Department on the current project.</P>
        <P>The proposal to provide a national stadium arose from recommendations made in a feasibility study, A Stadium for a New Century, which was commissioned in 1998 and concluded in 1999. In 2000, the Government decided to develop a national stadium at Abbotstown. Subsequently, in January 2004, the Government decided not to proceed with the proposal to provide a national stadium at Abbotstown but instead to support the redevelopment of the stadium at Lansdowne Road. The current project involves the redevelopment of the IRFU-owned stadium at Lansdowne Road into a 50,000 seat stadium to accommodate rugby, soccer and Gaelic games. The procurement of a stadium at Lansdowne Road will be undertaken by the Lansdowne Road stadium development company, once planning permission is secured. It is intended that an application for planning permission will be lodged before the end of the year. It is estimated that the construction of the stadium will take 29 months. The IRFU and the FAI will together contribute at least 34% of the cost of the project &mdash;&euro;101 million &mdash; and these funds will be raised by the forward selling of premium seats.</P>
        <P>No public servants are directly involved in the delivery of the project. However between the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Finance and the OPW, there are up to 12 people who have a degree of involvement in the delivery of the project at this time. The OPW has provided consultancy and advisory services throughout the project. To date, capital expenditure of &euro;1.3 million has been incurred on the project to develop the Lansdowne Road stadium.</P>
        <P>The proposal to provide a sports campus at Abbotstown arose from recommendations made in a feasibility study, A Stadium for a New Century, which was commissioned in 1998 and concluded in 1999. In January 2004 the Government reaffirmed its decision to develop a sports campus at Abbotstown. The development control plan for a sports campus at Abbotstown includes provision for a range of sports facilities, including training, medical and administrative facilities on <Col N="185"/>a phased delivery basis over a period of years. The Minister for Arts Sport and Tourism will submit the plan to Government shortly. Construction work on phase one of the project is expected to take 24 to 30 months to complete. The operation of the campus will involve an economic user charge for facilities. There are two public servants on secondment directly involved in the delivery of the project. In addition, there are 12 people in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Finance and the OPW, who have a degree of involvement in the delivery of the project at this time. The OPW has provided consultancy and advisory services to the Department of Arts Sport and Tourism throughout the project.</P>
        <P>Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd commissioned Davis Langdon PKS to assist in the preparation of a development and control plan for the sports campus at Abbotstown. The title of the report was &ldquo;Training to Win &mdash; Development Control Plan&rdquo;. Other than an earlier expenditure of &euro;3 million, which was spent on the Abbotstown sports campus site, there has been no additional capital expenditure on the Abbotstown sports campus project. The deployment of resources, including human resources, is made by my Department on the basis of priority, in line with overall Government and departmental objectives and I am satisfied that adequate <Col N="186"/>staff resources are currently deployed to deal with the projects in question.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>In the time available and given the number of projects involved, it has not been possible to provide a response on all capital projects considered in the arts, sport and tourism areas over the past five years. However, if there are specific projects in relation to which the Deputy would like information, I will be happy to provide details.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>

	<P>In his budget speech of 3 December 2003, the Minister for Finance announced a major change in the financial treatment of capital spending through the introduction of rolling five-year multi-annual envelopes for all investment areas. When introduced, one of the aims of the multi-annual capital investment framework was to maintain the aggregate envelope at close to 5% of GNP.</P>
        <P>Under this multi-annual investment framework, the total capital envelope available to my ministerial Vote group over the five-year period from 2005 to 2009 is as follows:</P><Col N="185"/>

	<P>The application of the statutory provisions in regard to maternity leave is a day-to-day matter for the bodies under the aegis of my Department. I have no plans to request them to provide additional <Col N="188"/>paid maternity leave and accordingly have not costed such a proposal.</P>
        <P>While I have no responsibility for the legislation in regard to parental leave, I understand there is no entitlement to paid parental leave under the terms of existing legislation. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is currently bringing the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Violence in any sector of the economy is a matter for reporting to the Garda for investigation and prosecution where an offence has been committed.</P>
        <P>Where violence is identified as a hazard at the workplace, employers are required under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 to include a provision in their safety statement to deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>While there are no specific occupational health and safety regulations relating to the prevention of violence at the workplace, an information and advisory booklet on the matter is available from the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>In so far as bullying is concerned, an expert advisory group established by my predecessor to look at the measures for the prevention of workplace bullying and to identify improvements is, I understand, finalising its report and will submit it to me shortly. I look forward to the report which I hope will be a useful input to the formulation of a policy to deal with the issue of workplace bullying.</P>

	<P>I have received a number of complaints in recent times on practices which involve the public in the use of premium rate telephone calls to claim so-called &ldquo;awards&rdquo; and where the only commercial transaction appears to be the inducement by the promoter to the consumer to use the telephone and in this way the promoter gains financial benefit. The consumer appears to receive nothing in return.</P>
        <P>I have asked my officials to examine these complaints and to discuss the matter with the Director of Consumer Affairs before deciding an appropriate response. I understand that the regulator for premium rate phone calls, Regtel, has initiated an investigation into the activities of one of the companies involved and has suspended the use of the premium rate phone line pending the result of the investigation.</P>

	<P>I note the concerns raised by the Deputy. I do not, however, have any detailed information in regard to drink prices in Bray and Greystones. In the matter of prices, including drink prices, the Government believes that the best policy is to promote greater competition and consumer awareness and to ensure that customers are in a position to make informed choices before deciding whether to purchase a particular product or service.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1999 obliges owners of licensed premises to display the price of a list of certain drinks immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to their premises. The order, which is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, provides customers with fair warning of the prices being charged before they enter a licensed premises. If members of the public discover instances where they believe prices are not properly displayed, they should bring this to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs who can be contacted at 4 Harcourt Road, Dublin 2 on lo-call number 1890 220 229 or by e-mail at <i>odca@entemp.ie</i>. Customers who believe drink prices in any particular premises to be unreasonably high should take their custom elsewhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>County and city enterprise boards, CEBs, play an extremely important role in developing the small business sector in Ireland and, to support them in delivering their programmes, nearly &euro;30 million in Exchequer funds has been allocated to fund them in 2005.</P>
        <P>The CEBs have been co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund under the current National Development Plan 2000-2006. I am aware that concerns exist about the future of the boards after the end of the current round of EU funding in 2006. At this stage, it is still not clear what level of EU funds will be available for Ireland in the next round of funding and, accordingly, it is likely to be some time before we will know how much EU funding, if any, will be available to support the CEBs programmes after 2006.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the uncertainty about EU funding that exists at present, I can confirm that it is my intention that an appropriate level of funding for the CEBs will be maintained for the foreseeable future. However, as with any programme of expenditure, the amount to be provided each year will have to be determined in the context of the usual budgetary constraints. As regards structures, the Government has approved a recommendation contained in the enterprise strategy group for the establishment of a new central co-ordination unit within Enterprise Ireland, which will provide the CEBs with central direction, technical support, shared services and quality assurance with a view to enhancing the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the CEBs. Discussions have already commenced between my Department and the relevant agencies regarding the steps necessary to implement the ESG&rsquo;s recommendation on this topic. While I have no plans at this time for any other changes to the structure of the network of CEBs throughout the country, the position will always be subject to review in the light of changing circumstances.</P>

	<P>The arrangements for maternity leave within the public bodies under the aegis of my Department are as laid down in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 (Extension of periods of leave) Order, 2001, and the Maternity Protection <Col N="192"/>(Amendment) Act 2004. All employees in the State are entitled to 18 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave and up to eight weeks&rsquo; unpaid maternity leave.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional paid maternity leave is not a matter for consideration by my Department. As the cost to the Exchequer of paid maternity or parental leave depends on the salary of the individual concerned, I am not in a position to give a likely cost.</P>

However, there is provision for continued payment of rent supplement to eligible people who wish to resume full-time education. People participating in approved courses under the back to education allowance or VTOS schemes are not disqualified because they are in full-time education and may claim rent supplement subject to satisfying the other standard conditions of the scheme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The Northside Community Law Centre is one of a number of organisations which are funded under my Department&rsquo;s scheme of grants for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights. Since its establishment in 1975, the centre has been funded exclusively by State agencies with the Department taking over direct funding in 1995. Annual funding has increased progressively over the years and the Department provided &euro;215,000 to the centre in 2004. The necessity for the centre to source additional funding over and above what the Department can provide has been explained to the board of the centre over a number of years. This would be in line with the situation of all other voluntary organisations funded through the Department&rsquo;s information grants scheme.</P>
        <P>I am fully cognisant of the valuable role which a community-based legal advice service such as the Northside Community Law Centre can play in the delivery of a comprehensive and cost effective legal advice service for citizens. However, I am satisfied that my Department is not in the long term the most appropriate source of funding for this service having regard to the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for funding legal aid services. Social welfare queries dealt with by the centre in 2004 represented less than 5% of its annual business. I have therefore written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, regarding future funding of the centre as an integral part of its legal aid services.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, my Department will continue to fund the centre as heretofore. Advance payments totalling &euro;140,000 have already been made to the centre this year so as to ensure continuity of service, including payment of salaries. It should be noted, however, that the centre is seeking a substantial increase in funding for 2005 which my Department will not be in a position to meet from its current budget. Discussions are continuing with the centre&rsquo;s management on these issues.</P>

        <Quest> when it is intended to ensure equity of treatment in respect of the disability allowance for all disabled clients in residential care.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, DPMA, scheme was transferred from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in October 1996. On the transfer of the scheme the existing qualifying conditions were retained and the scheme was renamed &ldquo;disability allowance&rdquo;. One of the qualifying conditions applying to the former DPMA scheme was that the payment <Col N="194"/>could not be made to people who were in residential care where the cost of the person&rsquo;s maintenance was met in whole or in part by a health board.</P>
        <P>Effectively, persons who would otherwise have qualified for disability allowance continued to have their maintenance costs and, in certain cases, an element of spending money met separately rather than through a disability allowance payment. Since the take-over of the scheme by my Department, the restrictions on payment to persons in residential care have been progressively changed. From August 1999 existing disability allowance recipients who are living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care. A review of illness and disability payment schemes completed by the Department in September 2003 recommended the removal of the residential care disqualification for disability allowance purposes. The working group which oversaw the review recognised that the removal would have a range of implications, and that, in the absence of reliable data on the numbers involved and the actual funding arrangements currently in place, it was not possible to fully assess the likely impact or cost of such a move.</P>
        <P>Budget 2003 provided for the take-over by my Department of the discretionary &ldquo;pocket money&rdquo; allowances paid to people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance and for the standardisation of the level of these allowances. The Department undertook an information gathering process with the health boards with a view to arranging for the transfer of responsibility for the payment of these allowances and of the funds involved.</P>
        <P>In budget 2005, I announced, as an interim measure, a payment of &euro;35 per week will be payable to the persons with disabilities who are affected by the current restriction with effect from June 2005. It was noted that there were a number of complex practical and administrative issues remain to be resolved with the Department of Health and Children and the health boards, such as the determination, as appropriate, of what proportion of the allowance could be retained by the institution as a contribution towards the resident&rsquo;s care and maintenance and the need to avoid any duplication of funding. It is my intention to progress the outstanding issues as a priority, so that all persons with disabilities can become entitled, as soon as possible, to the full rate of disability allowance irrespective of their residential status.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments with their additional heating needs during the winter season. Under the scheme an allowance of &euro;9.00 per week &mdash;&euro;12.90 per week in designated smokeless fuel areas &mdash; is paid to eligible households during the 29-week period from mid-October to the end of April each year. About 274,000 households will receive fuel allowances during 2005 at an estimated cost of some &euro;84.5 million. Some 300,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefit package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. If the duration of the winter heating season for fuel allowance purposes was to be extended for a further three weeks it would cost an extra &euro;8.7 million. Extending the scheme by one calendar month would cost an estimated &euro;12.6 million extra. The initial extra cost of any such extension in the scheme duration in the year of introduction would depend on whether it was to be applied at the start or end of the existing winter heating season.</P>
        <P>An important ongoing policy objective of this Government is to provide real increases in payment rates each year for people who depend on social welfare income support, to ensure that they can experience some improvement in their quality of life, including provision of adequate heating. In this regard, the significant increases in primary social welfare payment rates for pensioners and other groups this year and in recent years have improved their income situation considerably in real terms relative to fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. On this basis, I have no plans at present to extend the annual duration of the fuel allowance scheme. Any such change to the scheme would have to be considered in a budget context, and in the light of other priorities.</P>

	<P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that there are two schemes dealing with the provision of caretaking and secretarial duties. Ancillary staff employed by schools whose salary costs are paid directly, or recouped from the Department of Education and Science and who work for the full year, including during school holidays, are entitled to agreed levels of annual leave. The ancillary staff who work in schools in receipt of grant aid from the Department of Education and Science are employees of the individual schools and that Department has no role in determining their terms of employment and pay. It is a matter for individual schools to decide how best to apply the funding to suit a school&rsquo;s particular needs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the entitlement for annual leave and related social insurance issues, the employment of any employee, including those providing ancillary support in schools, must be in compliance with general conditions set down under both employment rights and social welfare legislation. I am not aware of any special arrangements for annual leave in place for these staff affecting social insurance. A day for which an employee either receives, or has an entitlement to holiday pay is not regarded as a day of unemployment. Annual leave is counted as additional periods of insurable employment.</P>

	<P>My Department currently issues approximately 1.1 million weekly payments of which 58% are paid through An Post. The Government&rsquo;s decision in 1999 to extend the Department&rsquo;s existing contractual arrangements with An Post gave rise to a complaint being lodged with the European Commission in 2000. That complaint was subsequently referred by the European Commission to the European Court of Justice.

There are no plans to change this arrangement.</P>

	<P>The submission in question includes three main issues which are relevant to my Department. These include submissions on the living alone allowance, pensions for older women and the role of modified insurance in qualifying conditions for contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>The living alone allowance is a supplement of &euro;7.70 per week payable with certain social welfare payments. The allowance is an integral part of the social welfare system but it is not a benefit in its own right. In order to receive the allowance a person must first qualify for one of a range of payments. I do not feel that it would be appropriate to establish the allowance as a separate benefit and to pay it to those who are not receiving income support from my Department.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of those who left work as a result of the marriage bar the position is that the issues which arise here relate to the occupational pension position of these women and are not something which fall to be addressed through the social welfare system. Questions in relation to the operation of the marriage bar are a matter for the Minister for Finance who has responsibility for the terms and conditions of employment and the pension arrangements for public servants generally.</P>
        <P>In general, the social insurance class paid by those affected by the marriage bar was a modified rate which gives coverage for widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and orphan&rsquo;s pensions and occupational injury benefit only. This reflected their occupational pension position and general contract of service. Accordingly, even if they had continued in employment, contributions paid at this class would only have entitled them to an occupational pension and not one paid under the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>That said, the Government is committed to making contributory payments available to as many people as possible within the basic social welfare structure, based on a combination of social insurance and means tested payments. In this regard, a number of special measures have been taken in recent years to provide pensions for people with deficient insurance records. These include a reduction in the average number of contributions required for pension purposes, the introduction of pro-rata pensions based on full and modified rate insurance and the provision of special payments such as the pre-53 pension. These measures are of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records.</P>
        <P>Measures are also in place since 1994 to protect the pension entitlement of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. This scheme, known as the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, allows for up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. Permanent and pensionable public servants and many employees in the semi-State sector employed before April 1995 are <Col N="199"/>liable for a modified rate of social insurance contribution. Such contributors have traditionally been insured for a limited range of social insurance benefits &mdash; widow&rsquo;s, widower&rsquo;s and orphan&rsquo;s &mdash; contributory &mdash; pensions, bereavement grant, occupational injuries benefits and carer&rsquo;s benefit. The level of benefits available broadly reflects the level of social insurance contribution paid and the reduced need for protection or coverage against Those recruited after 6 April 1995, however, are insurable at PRSI class A. These contributions can provide entitlement to the full range of social welfare benefits and pensions. However, the occupational pension entitlement of these employees has been modified to take account of their entitlements under the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The number of public servants paying PRSI class A is steadily increasing and will over time come to represent the norm throughout the public sector. However, modified insurance will play a major part in the insurability of those in the public service for many years to come with some 140,000 currently insured at these rates. Also, an estimated 77,000 pensioners are receiving payments from public service pension schemes covering civil servants, local authority staff, the education sector, the Garda, Defence Forces, health service and non-commercial semi-State bodies, the majority of whom were probably in the insurance category under review. Any changes in the status of modified social insurance contributions would have major immediate and ongoing cost implications for the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>The relationship between social welfare pensions and existing occupational pension entitlements would also have to be reviewed to ensure consistency of treatment between those who paid modified insurance and post 1995 recruits to the public service. At this stage I have no plans to change the status of modified social insurance contributions as suggested.</P>

	<P>The four statutory agencies operating under the aegis of my Department are the Pensions Board, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle and the family support agency. The Pensions Ombudsman&rsquo;s office also comes under the remit of my Department. The terms and conditions for maternity leave which apply in the agencies are in accordance with the terms provided for in the Maternity Protection Acts 1994, as revised in October 2004. Entitlement to maternity benefit is contingent on entitlement to maternity leave, legislation for which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>For employees paying PRSI contributions which cover maternity benefit, the arrangements in place are either full salary paid less maternity benefit, which is paid directly to the employee, or full salary paid to the employee and the maternity benefit paid directly to the agency during the core maternity leave period of 18 weeks. Employees paying PRSI contributions not covering maternity benefit are paid full salary during the core maternity leave period.</P>
        <P>The maternity benefit scheme has been significantly improved over the past four years, in both the duration of payment and the level at which it is paid. The estimated cost of the maternity benefit scheme for 2005 is &euro;137.1 million, an increase of &euro;59 million since 2001. Improvements were made as recently as 2001, to increase core maternity leave, which attracted an entitlement to maternity benefit, from 14 to 18 weeks. The period of unpaid maternity leave was also increased from four to eight weeks, bringing the total period of maternity leave to which a woman is entitled to 26 weeks. Based on the current average number of recipients and average rate of payment an increase in the duration of maternity benefit by eight weeks would cost approximately &euro;60.9 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>While there are no plans to extend the period for which maternity benefit is paid, I have advised that this issue be kept under constant review. On the question of paid parental benefit, any such entitlement would be contingent on an underly<Col N="201"/>ing entitlement to parental leave. Responsibility for the current provisions on parental leave rests primarily with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing a payment for periods of parental leave, including the question of whether such a payment should be made by employers or in the form of a social welfare payment, has been examined by the working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to review the operation of the Parental Leave Act 1998. In its report, published in 2002, the working group said that it could not reach a consensus on the issue and therefore no specific proposals for paid parental leave were advanced. The cost of a social welfare parental leave benefit would depend on a number of factors, including the level of such payment, the duration of payment and the level of take up. The working group concluded that a payment equivalent to the rate of disability benefit and lasting for 14 weeks would cost approximately &euro;35.5 million, while a payment equivalent to the rate of maternity benefit would cost approximately &euro;78 million a year. Given labour force trends and the increase in payment rates it is likely that costs would have increased since that time.</P>
        <P>There would also be additional Exchequer costs arising from the payroll costs of the many public servants who do not pay full PRSI contribution. It is clear that the introduction of paid parental leave would have significant cost implications for employers and-or the Exchequer and the social insurance fund. Any proposals for introducing any such a payment would have to examined with regard to its effect on the sustainability of the social insurance fund and employers&rsquo; costs.</P>

        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s estimate of the economic and social loss as a result of road congestion in view of the OECD estimate that this figure is around 2% per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no official estimates of the costs associated with traffic congestion. My Department is aware of international empirical research, which estimates the economic and social costs of road congestion to be significant and of work carried out by the Dublin Transportation Office in 2002 on the cost of congestion in the greater Dublin area. The 2002 study estimated the cost of congestion to be of the order of &euro;2 billion per annum.</P>
        <P>The European Conference of Ministers of Transport is undertaking a major research study on tackling congestion in larger metropolitan areas and one of the issues it is seeking to address is whether congestion can be measured in a consistent and meaningful way. I am aware of the adverse impacts of traffic congestion on the economy and on the national well-being. The growth <Col N="202"/>in population, employment, the economy and traffic in recent years has added to traffic congestion. It is an unfortunate side effect of our sustained economic success.</P>
        <P>In response to the congestion problem the Government has significantly increased investment in Ireland&rsquo;s transport system over the last several years. Capital investment in public transport since 2000 amounts to more than &euro;2 billion and a large portion of this is focused on measures to increase capacity, particularly in the greater Dublin area. This includes the provision of additional rolling stock and buses, measures to facilitate the operation of longer trains and the quality bus corridor programme. Investment in the ambitious national roads programme is at an all time high. Over &euro;115 million per month is being provided to fund the various upgrade projects. The beneficial impact of this major increase in investment is already evident in the elimination of major traffic bottlenecks leading to shorter journey times and greater journey time certainty. Long standing bottlenecks such as Kildare, Monasterevin, Cashel, Sligo, Ballincollig, Drogheda, and Youghal have already been addressed.</P>
        <P>This high level of investment is set to continue over the next decade. I am finalising a ten year transport investment framework to identify the investment and outline the measures required to further develop all elements of the national transport infrastructure. A key objective of this plan will be to put in place a series of integrated measures that will address the congestion problem. The plan will detail how we plan to tackle the transport system&rsquo;s remaining bottlenecks and capacity constraints as well at looking at how we can optimise the use of the network and make prudent advance provision for future economic growth. However, investment alone is not the sole answer. The Dublin Transportation Office is working on the development of a demand management strategy for the greater Dublin area and I look forward to receiving its recommendations in due course.</P>

	<P>The person named, having been notified that the circumstances outlined by her did not satisfy the criteria for <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee. The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.</P>
        <P>However, my Department has now obtained additional information regarding the circumstances of this case and are satisfied that <i>force majeure</i> should be applied. As a result, the year 2000 will be excluded and the single farm payment entitlement will be based on the two year average of 2001 and 2002 only. The person named was notified of this decision on 19 April 2005. An updated statement of provisional entitlements reflecting this position also issued to the person named on 19 April 2005.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which participants in the afforestation grant scheme will be treated under the entitlements system, for the purposes of the 2005 single payment scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>To activate entitlements, farmers must submit a valid application under the single <Col N="208"/>payment scheme in 2005. Except in cases of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances, where a valid application is not submitted, entitlements will be transferred to the national reserve.</P>
        <P>Farmers who wish to plant their land and consolidate their entitlements this year must: apply for consolidation on their SFP form before 16 May 2005; have received their pre-planting approval from the Forest Service prior to 31 May 2005; and complete planting by 30 June 2005. This means that farmers can now take full advantage of the entire spring planting season and still consolidate their entitlements this year. All farmers who have received their pre-planting approval letters for new afforestation projects before 16 May should declare the appropriate parcels as &ldquo;forestry&rdquo; on their single payment scheme application form.</P>
        <P>Farmers who expect to get approval after 16 May but before 31 May may also declare the parcels earmarked for planting as &ldquo;forestry&rdquo; on the SPS form. However, such farmers will need to monitor their application closely through their forestry company or consultant.</P>
        <P>In the event that approval does not come through by 31 May or if planting will not be completed on the land by 30 June, farmers should submit a SPS amendment form, reclassifying the parcel/s already declared for forestry as &ldquo;forage lands&rdquo;, and withdraw their application to consolidate their entitlements in 2005. Ideally, this should be done prior to 31 May. Amendments may be submitted up to 10 June but would be subject to a penalty in respect of the parcel or parcels of 1% per working day effective from 1 June.</P>
        <P>Farmers considering afforestation in either the current planting season or in the autumn should select the earliest possible start date for the commencement of the ten month land availability requirement &mdash; 1 September 2004 where possible &mdash; ensuring there is no overlap with previous declarations in respect of the 2004 direct payment schemes. The closer the start date is to 1 September 2004, the earlier the parcel becomes available for planting again. Should the pre-planting approval arrive after the 31 May 2005 deadline, planting can be postponed until the autumn planting season when the parcel is &ldquo;free&rdquo; again. Farmers in this situation can then apply to consolidate in 2006.</P>
        <P>Farmers should make sure that at least 50% of their land remains unplanted, in order to leave sufficient entitlements to consolidate. Farmers may wish to consult with their Teagasc adviser or forestry company or consultant on this point. With regard to farmers who hold a joint management agreement or have applied for pre-planting approval with such an arrangement, it is the recipient of the single payment who is entitled to consolidate. Farmers in receipt of forestry premium who are not applying for payment under the single payment scheme do not need to com<Col N="209"/>plete the SPS form in 2005. Their 2005 forestry premium will be processed in the usual manner.</P>
        <P>Farmers should consider carefully the consequences of consolidation if there is a possibility that they might wish to avail of the early retirement scheme or might wish to retire from farming within the next five years. Consolidated entitlements are allocated from the national reserve and cannot be sold or leased for five years. These entitlements must also be claimed each year for five years, failing which the unclaimed entitlements will revert to the national reserve.</P>

	<P>The person named has had his single payment entitlement calculation based on the years 2000 to 2002. He has applied to have this calculation reviewed and has sought to have the reference period 1997 to 1999 used instead as he had de-stocked his sheep from 397 in respect of 1997 and 1998.</P>
        <P>His application for a review has now been examined. His single payment calculation will be revised and the earlier reference period will now be used in his entitlements calculation.

	<P>Work has commenced in my Department on the transposition of EU Directive 2004/28, which is the revised EU legislation governing veterinary medicines. This exercise will involve ongoing technical liaison with the Irish Medicines Board on aspects with particular operational implications for that body.</P>
        <P>The deadline stipulated in the directive for transposition into national law is 30 October 2005, which is also the date for implementation of the majority of its provisions. However, the directive specifically provides that existing national rules relating to certain distribution aspects, particularly the veterinary prescription arrangements for medicines for food producing animals, may remain in place until 1 January 2007 or until exemption criteria have been adopted, whichever is the earlier.</P>
        <P>It is the intention of my Department to comply with the deadline of 30 October 2005 for the transposition of the directive. The draft statutory instrument will be brought before the animal remedies consultative committee in sufficient time to meet this deadline.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 184 to 186, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Most capital expenditure incurred by my Department over the past five years has generally been on demand-led schemes. Expenditure under such schemes relates to grants paid to individual farmers, co-operatives or companies who present grant applications to undertake certain approved works for which grant payment is subject to the projects being satisfactorily completed. As the aided projects are owned by private parties, the matter of user charges, where relevant, is a matter for the promoters concerned. Capital grant expenditure relates to on-farm investments, marketing and processing type investments, details of which are available in the annual Book of Estimates and in the Department&rsquo;s publication, Schemes and Services.</P>
        <P>Actual expenditure under a particular measure is driven by a number of factors such as: the individual measure under which grant applications are submitted; the rate of completion by the promoter; and the number and value of applications received, approved and processed for payment in any one year. As demand-led grant schemes are administered by Department staff, the engagement of outside consultants does not arise. </P><Col N="211"/>

	<P>The fight against terrorism remains a key focus for co-operation between the member states of the European Union in the context of the development of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice. That co-operation is now being taken forward within the framework of the European Council&rsquo;s March 2004 declaration on combating terrorism and the Hague programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union. There is already in place a co-ordinated policy at EU level to respond to the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms. Specifically, in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States of America on 11 September 2001, the European Council adopted an EU plan of action to combat terrorism.</P>
        <P>In response to the Madrid terrorist bombings on 11 March 2004, the Irish Presidency of the European Union secured the adoption by the European Council on 25 March 2005, of a declaration on combating terrorism. A revised EU action plan to combat terrorism was also subsequently adopted during the Irish Presidency. These measures were designed to reinforce the determination of the EU to prevent and fight terrorism.</P>
        <P>The wide-ranging action plan brings together a comprehensive package of measures to be taken in the fight against terrorism and lists them on the basis of the strategic objectives outlined in the annex to the declaration. The action plan, which is kept under review, identifies the competent bodies responsible for implementing each measure together with a deadline within which that task is to be completed. The Hague programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union, which was adopted by the European Council in November 2004, represents a new overall framework for the development of co-operation in justice and home affairs matters in the coming years. The Hague programme emphasises the need for a continuing focus on the implementation of the declaration <Col N="214"/>and action plan for the purpose of combating terrorism as well as identifying a number of priority measures in this regard.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, discussions on terrorism-related matters take place at the level of the EU Council of Ministers on a regular basis. The Council is required to carry out periodic assessments concerning the implementation of the declaration on combating terrorism and the action plan.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 189, 190 and 209 to 211, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In the 2004 budget, the Minister for Finance announced a five year multi-annual framework for capital expenditure commencing in the years 2004-08. This is a rolling capital investment framework and current planning of capital expenditure across the group of Votes for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform focuses therefore on 2005-09 rather than on a ten year period.</P>
        <P>A funding envelope of &euro;1.1 billion has been approved for the period to 2009, incorporating &euro;380 million by way of public private partnerships. Key projects which will be made possible thanks to this funding include a new state-of-the-art criminal courts complex at Infirmary Road, new prisoner accommodation at Portlaoise Prison together with additional facilities at Limerick Prison, expansion of the capital grant element of the equal opportunities child care programme as well as the introduction of the new nationwide Garda digital radio system.</P>
        <P>There are many other capital projects under way or in planning, including the development of the new prison complex at Thornton Hall, but in light of the very broad range of services in the justice area, it has not been possible in the time available to fully compile the detailed information requested. The information requested is currently being compiled and I will forward it to the Deputy shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 and 207 together.</P>
        <P>After a lengthy and difficult negotiations process between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, involving both the Labour Relations Commission and the Civil Service arbitration board, discussions between the parties concluded on 8 February 2005 with agreement being reached on a proposal for organisational change in the prison service. This proposal was put to staff for ballot and I was advised of the outcome on 20 April 2005.</P>
        <P>The staff have rejected the proposal which was recommended for acceptance by the national executive of the POA. The protracted industrial relations process involved resulted in a significant financial package, including an allowance of 8% of basic pay, guaranteed payments for additional attendance at a premium rate and lump sum payments amounting to &euro;13,750 per officer. Under the deal, a basic grade prison officer at the top of the scale had the potential to earn almost &euro;70,000 per annum when the agreement was fully implemented.</P>
        <P>The issue of excessive costs and overtime goes back to 1995. I have been very patient with this process. I gave management and staff ample space and time to agree a way forward which would effectively eliminate the scourge of unsustainable overtime which has bedevilled the prison service. The arrangements agreed between the sides at the Labour Relations Commission and the financial elements which emerged from the subsequent arbitration process offered a real solution which would work to the benefit of both management and staff. However, staff have opted to reject the package and I now have no option but to look to alternative measures to secure real control of prison service expenditure given that the full range of industrial relations machinery available has now been exhausted. I must now proceed to take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that the valuable resources which are at my disposal are used efficiently and effectively. Deputies will already be aware from my public response to the ballot result what those measures will entail but I will outline them again for the record.</P>
        <P>In the context of the mandate that I already have from my Cabinet colleagues to pursue certain measures to curtail expenditure in the service, I have decided to proceed with the following measures: early enactment of legislation already approved by Government to privatise the prisoner escort service; parallel arrangements for tenders for privatisation of prisoner escorts; the permanent closure of the Curragh and Fort Mitchel places of detention which are currently mothballed and the transfer of the staff from those prisons on a permanent basis to other prisons; the withdrawal of the two open centres <Col N="217"/>at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey from the prison service and their transformation into post release centres run on a similar basis by external staff.</P>
        <P>I will inform the director general of the prison service and the prison governors that, with effect from the beginning of May 2005, spending in each prison will be managed on a strict cash basis with monthly limits and that staffing levels will have to conform to those limits. In addition, measures to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the service through the use of new technology such as CCTV, automated gates and video links will be rolled out as a matter of priority. Staff have made their decision in the full knowledge of the consequences. It was made quite clear to the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association and their members that failure to conclude agreement on this deal following the extensive assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and the considered adjudication of the Civil Service arbitration board could mean only one thing and that is the progressive implementation of measures along the lines of those I have outlined. I have no choice now but to act to bring to an end the damaging and unsustainable overtime culture among prison staff.</P>

A proposal for organisational change in the prison service, which was put to the staff for ballot, has been rejected. Since there is no scope to renegotiate that deal, I will be proceeding with the progressive implementation of a series of measures as already approved by the Government, to secure real control of expenditure in the prison service, including the permanent closure of the Curragh Place of Detention. The issue of the redeployment of the staff of the institution&rsquo;s education unit will be among the matters to be considered in the context of such closure.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 722 of 12 April 2005, the reason a person&rsquo;s spouse (details supplied) was granted a re-entry visa while their passport and permission to remain in the State was due to expire on the same date as their passport and permitted time to remain in the State; the way in which two different decisions were arrived at based upon the same particulars in respect of authorised permission to remain in the State and the valid dates of passports in view of the fact that they have now been authorised to remain in <Col N="218"/>the State until 21 February 2008; if he will take steps to ensure that a re-entry visa is granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P> The visa application referred to by the Deputy was for a re-entry visa for a non-EEA national resident in the State. The applicant in question entered the State illegally in May 1999 with her husband and one son. They subsequently claimed asylum and later obtained permission to remain in the State based on parentage of an Irish born child. In October 2004, two applications were received for re-entry visas for the non-EEA national and her husband. Under a scheme known as delegated sanction, the Department of Foreign Affairs is permitted in limited circumstances to grant visa applications without reference to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In cases where these circumstances are not met or where the initial inspection identifies potential complications, the application is forwarded to my Department for more in-depth assessment.</P>
        <P>As the application for the wife requested the inclusion of her child on any visa issued, the Department of Foreign Affairs was not in a position to process the application without reference to my Department. This is necessary for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the widespread abuse of the re-entry visa system. Following the extensive examination of the application and its supporting documentation, as is standard with referred applications, it was discovered that the applicant&rsquo;s permission to remain was due to expire in the near future. For this reason alone the application was refused.</P>
        <P>As the husband&rsquo;s application did not mention or require the inclusion of a child, the Department of Foreign Affairs was permitted to process it under the delegated sanction scheme. It would not be normal practice to grant a re-entry visa in a case where the applicant&rsquo;s permission to remain is due to expire in the near future and this was a central factor in the decision to refuse the wife&rsquo;s application. However a visa was exceptionally approved in this case. There was no mention at initial or appeal stage of the applicants having had their permission to remain extended. As this application has already been the subject of an appeal and as each application may be appealed only once, it is not possible to facilitate further examination of this application. However, in light of the information provided by the Deputy to the effect that the applicants now have permission to remain until 2008, it is open to the lady in question to submit a fresh application which will be considered on its own merits.</P>

        <Quest>the arrangements for maternity leave within the public bodies under the aegis of his Department; if he will consider providing an additional eight weeks&rsquo; paid leave in regard to maternity leave; the likely cost thereof; the likely cost to the Exchequer of six weeks&rsquo; paid parental leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The maternity leave arrangements for employees in the public bodies under the aegis of my Department are the same as those which apply in the Civil Service generally &mdash; 18 weeks paid maternity leave with the option of a further eight weeks additional unpaid maternity leave.</P>
        <P>A review of the maternity protection legislation was carried out in 2000 by a working group, chaired by my Department, which comprised the social partners and relevant Departments and agencies.</P><Col N="224"/>
        <P>Among its recommendations, the working group recommended an increase in the maternity leave entitlement, which attracts a payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, from 14 weeks to 18 weeks, and an increase in the unpaid additional maternity leave entitlement from four weeks to eight weeks. These increases were announced in budget 2001 and implemented by means of the Maternity Protection Act 1994 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order 2001 (S.I. No. 29 of 2001), with effect from 8 March 2001.</P>
        <P>The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, which was commenced on 18 October last, implemented a number of other improvements recommended by the maternity protection review group. There are no plans for a further extension of the maternity leave periods. Official costs would fall to be made in the context of any further reviews.</P>
        <P>A proposal for paid parental leave was considered in the context of a review of the Parental Leave Act 1998, which was conducted by a working group chaired by my Department. The working group comprised the social partners, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority. The report of the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 was published on 29 April 2002.</P>
        <P>The working group did not reach consensus on the principle of paid parental leave and, accordingly, did not address all the possible options this raises. However, the potential cost of a social insurance payment for the 14 weeks&rsquo; parental leave, based on the qualifying criteria for the maternity benefit scheme and a payment level equivalent to maternity benefit, was estimated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2001 during the review of the Act.</P>
        <P>The potential cost per annum of 14 weeks paid parental leave is as follows. Social insurance payment in respect of parental leave based on the earnings related maternity benefit rate and a 90% leave uptake by women and a 15% uptake level by men would amount to &euro;78.84 million.</P>
        <P>Public sector employer costs &mdash; where the rate of payment for parental leave to public sector employees &mdash; would in all likelihood be full pay, similar to maternity leave, and the cost to public sector employers, net of Department of Social and Family Affairs reimbursements in respect of full PRSI contributors, would amount to &euro;50.5 million.</P>
        <P>Total cost to social insurance fund and the Exchequer, if parental leave attracted a payment on the same basis as maternity leave, is estimated to amount to &euro;129.34 million. The estimated total cost would be significantly higher now in view of increases since 2001 made in maternity benefit rates and public sector pay.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed as part of the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement to strengthen the parental leave scheme in accordance with the recommendations agreed in the report of the working group on the review and <Col N="225"/>improvement of the Parental Leave Act 1998. In this regard, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 was published and initiated in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on 16 December 2004. The Bill is currently awaiting Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>The current five year capital envelope provides for investment of &euro;3.4 billion to 2009. It will be necessary as a minimum to sustain that level of investment for the following five year period to 2014 in order to address the infrastructure deficit at all levels of the education system and to meet emerging needs.</P>
        <P>My Department is working on a continuous basis to estimate future requirements drawing on the most up to date census data, the development plans of local authorities and the new area development plans being prepared by the Department itself and the commission on school accommodation. The Department will also assess the impact on capital requirements of future policy developments both within the education sector and the knock-on impact of other changes <Col N="226"/>that may have implications for education provision such as increased changes that might occur in inward migration due to EU enlargement and meeting skills needs in the economy.</P>
        <P>The Kelly report on the infrastructure needs of the third level sector prepared by the HEA and published last year contains a number of projects that will individually exceed &euro;20 million and which are for delivery in the period in question. It is also likely that the PPP allocation within the capital envelope will involve the bundling of individual projects from within the education sector at a combined value of at least &euro;20 million in order to ensure market interest at competitive levels.</P>

	<P>In December 1999 the Government decided that the Department of Education and Science would purchase 65 acres of the 73-acre Grangegorman site from the Eastern Health Board, and that the site would house the new Dublin Institute of Technology community campus. An interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, was set up in May 2001 to examine the project. In July 2001, consultants were appointed to carry out a strategic review of the issues associated with the development of the Grangegorman site on behalf of the working group. One of the main recommendations of the consultants was that an agency be established to develop the site as a campus for health and education facilities. The legislation for the establishment of the Grangegorman Development Agency completed Committee Stage last December. It is expected that the Report Stage will be before the House in the near future.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the current situation is that any institution may apply for university status under the provisions of the University Act 1997. With regard to the reforms proposed for the higher education sector in the OECD Review of Higher Education, the Government has approved the broad thrust of reforms contained therein, while noting the ongoing process of extensive consultation with key stakeholders in the sector.</P>
        <P>A colloquium was held in January between myself, senior officials in my Department, the HEA, the CHIU and the council of directors of institutes of technology where some of these issues were explored. This is just the beginning of a series of consultative forums which will focus on areas of priority for reform and modernisation. It is my objective that a consensus should emerge from the process of consultation, and I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of this by focusing on any single recommendation in isolation of full consideration of the report.</P>

	<P>There are no plans to provide legislation in the context of Irish sign language, ISL, at present. I wish to advise the Deputy that ISL has formal recognition in the Education Act 1998. Under the Act, it is a function of the Minister for Education and Science to ensure, subject to the provisions of the Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person. This includes provision for students learning through ISL.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives which seek to promote, develop and implement ISL in order that it will achieve greater recognition and use in the education system are currently in place. These include: the special schools for the deaf in Cabra, Dublin, have been encouraged with regard to the use of sign language in class; in-service training is provided in the use of ISL; my Department has provided funding for an ISL weekly home tuition service whereby deaf tutors visit the homes of deaf pre-school children and deaf school-going pupils to provide training in ISL for the deaf children-pupils, their siblings and parents; my Department has sanctioned a pre-school for deaf children on a pilot basis with programmes delivered through the medium of ISL as a first language; my Department, through the Higher Education Authority, HSA, has established and fully funds a centre for deaf studies in Trinity College, Dublin which provides diploma courses for ISL-English interpreters, deaf tutors and in deaf studies.</P>

	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. There are 108 special schools nationally, employing in the region of 1,000 teachers at an annual salary cost of approximately &euro;45 million. Other resources provided include special needs assistants, enhanced capitation grants, funding for assistive technology, capital grants etc. The level of resources provided are generally based on the pupils assessed needs.</P>
        <P>I recognise the valuable role of special schools throughout the country. I will be asking my Department in consultation with the National <Col N="231"/>Council for Special Education and other partners to consider how we can optimise the role and potential of special schools.

	<P>The cost of introducing and supporting a new programme varies depending on the programme, the level of change involved and the degree of training and support necessary, the number of students and teachers who will be affected by the change, and whether additional equipment or resource grants are necessary for the programme. In addition, the level of support needed will decline after the initial introductory period. The main cost factors arising relate to development of the syllabus, guidelines and support materials, provision of in-service training for teachers, operation of support services, equipment, and evaluation and monitoring.</P>
        <P>A national curriculum in social, personal and health education, SPHE, incorporating relationships and sexuality education has been developed at junior cycle level and this has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils.</P>
        <P>As an indicator of cost, the cost of supporting the social personal and health education programme in junior cycle and the relationships and sexuality education component in senior cycle in 2004 was approximately &euro;1.092 million. This included the provision of 13 support staff funded by the Department of Education and Science and ten support staff funded by the health boards, and the operational and delivery costs for in-service training for teachers. However, this programme was phased in over a three-year period beginning in September 2000 and the investment needed in the introductory phase, allied with the cost of teacher guidelines and manuals, would have been significantly higher.</P>

	<P>A cross-governmental working group was established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among its recommendations was the proposal that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children explore the possibility of developing an employment history register, similar to the PECS system in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>An implementation group has been established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children are ongoing in that context. In addition, my Department will convene a meeting with the relevant interested parties to explore the issues involved. Although considerable preparatory work examining the issues relating to a PECS system has been undertaken by my Department, given that substantial further work needs to be undertaken it is not possible at this time to estimate the cost of introducing a PECS system.</P>
        <P>The implementation group is also examining issues relating to the introduction of legislation to ensure the maintenance of a national criminal records system within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the disclosure of not just hard facts but also softer information, and access to information about, and proof of, criminal convictions for the purposes of litigation.</P>
        <P>The working group also recognised the need to expand the number of agencies which could access the central vetting unit operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include all people working with children and vulnerable adults. To that end, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided to the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with children and vulnerable adults. The initiative includes the more than doubling of staff resources for the unit to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council also has a role here. Once it is formally established, the council will provide the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to self-regulate and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and if necessary removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.</P>

	<P>The most recent finalised data collected by my Department on participation in <Col N="234"/>third level education &mdash; 2003-2004 &mdash; indicates that there are currently 143,271 full-time, undergraduate and postgraduate, and 34,168 part-time students enrolled in all third level institutions, aided and non-aided, in the State. The data also indicates that 10% of full-time new entrants, that is 4,216 out of 38,835 new enrolments in 2004-05 in all higher education institutions are mature students.</P>
        <P>Data on the age profile of part-time students for the academic year in question is not currently available, though plans are in place to develop collection systems by the Higher Education Authority, HEA.</P>
        <P>It has been long-standing Government policy to increase the number of mature students participating in higher education and to support life-long learning. For example, participation by mature students has almost doubled over the past ten years which reflects the increased support being made available to a number of higher education institutions through the HEA strategic initiative fund.</P>
        <P>Some &euro;40 million has been invested in developing third level access programmes and associated student support structures. Furthermore, a national action plan 2005-2007 to achieve equity of access to higher education was published in December 2004. This plan, which has been developed by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, identifies a number of key goals and actions over the next three years to achieve greater equity of access to higher education for groups currently under-represented in the sector. This includes mature students as well as other groups such as persons with a disability, socio-economically disadvantaged school-leavers, members of the Traveller community and ethnic minority groups.</P>
        <P>One of the key goals in this action plan is, through an evaluation of existing access programmes, to develop and implement a national framework of policies, initiatives and successful partnerships to widen access and to support the subsequent participation of all under-represented groups in higher education, including mature students. This will include arrangements so that all disadvantaged regions, schools and communities are linked to access activities and programmes in at least one higher education institution in their region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1979 scheme for the employment of full-time caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. There are currently 196 caretakers employed in primary schools under this scheme at an annual cost of approximately &euro;5.5 million. These caretakers are paid directly through my Department&rsquo;s payroll.</P>
        <P>Arrangements for the introduction of a pension scheme for caretakers employed under the 1979 scheme are currently being put in place and it is intended to commence superannuation deductions with effect from September next for those caretakers eligible for membership of the pension scheme. The eligible personnel will be advised of the details of the scheme prior to the commencement of deductions. In accordance with standard public service arrangements, provision will be made for reckoning service given prior to the commencement of ongoing deductions, subject to payment of appropriate contributions.</P>
        <P>The cost of paying superannuation benefits in any year is related to the number of pensions in payment and the number of retirees in the year. Individual pensions are determined by reference to the member&rsquo;s reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years reckonable service, and the member&rsquo;s retiring pensionable pay. The member&rsquo;s life expectancy on pension and whether, on the member&rsquo;s death, a spouse&rsquo;s pension is payable are also factors that have to be taken into account. Therefore the precise cost of pension benefits is difficult to quantify in advance.</P>
        <P>In line with standard public service pension provisions for such personnel, pension on retire<Col N="236"/>ment would be calculated, for each year of reckonable service, at the rate of one eightieth of net pensionable pay at retirement &mdash; net pensionable pay is pay less twice the rate of contributory old age pension for an adult without dependants. A retirement gratuity, calculated at the rate of three eightieths of pensionable pay would also be payable in respect of each year of reckonable service. Pension contributions would be payable by the retiree by deduction from the retirement gratuity in respect of any reckonable service for which contributions had not been paid while in service.</P>
        <P>The 1979 scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. It has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
        <P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.</P>
        <P>The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from &euro;102 in 2002 to &euro;127 in 2004, is being further increased to &euro;133 this year. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of &euro;7,980 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or fewer and a maximum grant of &euro;66,500 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, provided the school in question does not already have either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme.</P>
        <P>The question of appropriate pension cover for personnel engaged to deliver caretaking services by schools funded under the ancillary services grant, is still under examination. In the short term the recent introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, provides an option to such personnel to provide for their retirement.</P>

The total cost of providing the NEPS service in 2004 was &euro;13.5 million, including the cost of the scheme for the commissioning of psychological assessments, SCPA, administered by NEPS, under which schools currently without a NEPS service can commission assessments from private <Col N="237"/>practitioners in urgent cases. These figures do not include the psychological services provided by the vocational education committees of the city and county of Dublin.</P>

	<P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Some 13 towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are <Col N="238"/>designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>The overall authorised staffing complement of the NEWB is 94, comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 11 senior educational welfare officers and 62 educational welfare officers. Currently there are 48 educational welfare officers and 11 senior educational welfare officers serving with the board. The annual salaries of the 59 serving educational welfare officer staff amount to &euro;3.1 million approximately.</P>
        <P>The annual salary cost of employing an additional 300 educational welfare officers would be &euro;15.7 million approximately. There would also be further costs incurred by the Exchequer arising from the recruitment of the additional officers such as the provision of accommodation and associated corporate services, IT facilities and travel and subsistence expenses.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that an application for five hours resource teaching support and a full-<Col N="239"/>time special needs assistant, SNA, was considered by my Department. As the Deputy is aware, a letter issued to the school in September 2004 advising that three and a half hours resource teaching support was sanctioned. The school authorities were also advised recently that this pupil did not meet the criteria for SNA support as there was insufficient evidence of care needs. I can also confirm that correspondence relating to the level of this pupil&rsquo;s SEN allocation was received recently in my Department. This correspondence has been sent to the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, for consideration. The NCSE will make direct contact with the school in this context and the school authorities will be notified directly of the outcome.</P>
        <P>The school currently has the services of two learning support teachers and seven resource teachers. It is a matter for the school to deploy these resources to meet the special educational needs of the pupils in the school.</P>

        <P>Any changes to paid maternity leave arrangements would be an issue for the Government as a whole. My Department does not have an estimate of the cost of extending parental leave as requested by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>With regard to parental leave, the Deputy might be interested in an estimate that was provided by the working group on the review of the Parental Leave Act 1998 in its report, published on 29 April 2002. The group estimated that the cost to the public sector of 14 weeks&rsquo; parental leave at full pay, similar to maternity leave, would amount to &euro;50.5 million, based on 2001 costs. At current costs the figure would be approximately &euro;60.6 million.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 248 to 252, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The most important defence against terrorist attacks is detection and prevention by the security forces. While the Garda has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist the Garda, when requested. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.</P>
        <P>The terrorist threat to Ireland is continually assessed. The advice available suggests that while the terrorist threat to parts of Europe is high, it is low in regard to Ireland. However it is prudent that we should take precautions and keep matters under continuous review. Arrangements exist between the security forces of European member states and other states to ensure effective liaison in regard to security threats arising.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September. It included, <i>inter alia</i>, an update of the threat assessment; intensive contacts with other State agencies; a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems; the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search; and a review of equipment, including the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures <Col N="242"/>updated as required. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to expand on the operational details of such plans. The capacity of the Defence Forces to deal with major emergencies is kept under constant review. Plans and procedures are updated as necessary and such additional equipment as is required to address any perceived deficiencies is acquired on the basis of identified priorities. Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting its members in dealing with nuclear, biological or chemical, NBC, threats identified from time to time. The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the director of operations and the director of ordnance. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. In particular, a total of 8,000 new NBC suits has been acquired. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up-to-date chemical agent monitors and Defence Forces personnel are being trained on their operation. Other equipment on hands includes biological agent detector, screening kits and group and personal decontamination equipment. The most important defence against an attack is external vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces. All the necessary resources of the Garda and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.</P>

	<P>The refurbishment of residential accommodation is an integral part of my Department&rsquo;s ongoing building programme. Major contracts to improve the standard of accommodation have been placed over the past number of years as part of an ongoing investment programme within the Defence Forces. For example, from 2003 to date, major accommodation upgrades have taken place in McKee and Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin; Coolmoney Camp, Wicklow; Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick; Kickham Barracks, Clonmel; Naval Base, Haulbowline; Casement Aerodrome Baldonnel; Kilworth Camp, Cork; Custume Barracks, Athlone and D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;sa, Galway. Further accommodation upgrades will commence later this year in the Defence Forces training centre at the Curragh; Custume Barracks, Athlone; Finner Camp, Donegal and D&uacute;n U&iacute; <Col N="243"/>Mhaoil&iacute;sa, Galway. I assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to the ongoing development of accommodation facilities throughout the Defence Forces, and improvements will continue to be carried out until all accommodation has been modernised.</P>

	<P>The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. I am aware that significant investment has taken place in recent years, and I will continue the good work in that regard.</P>
        <P>The unprecedented level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service was made possible by the Government&rsquo;s decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.</P>
        <P>Investment in new equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, engineering, communications and information technology equipment, etc.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of light tactical armoured vehicles, or LTAVs, for the Defence Forces has been identified as a key priority by the military authorities for 2005. The LTAVs will complement the work of the 65 Mowag armoured personnel carriers delivered in the last few years at a cost of some &euro;84 million. The final-stage payments for the APCs of &euro;9.6 million will be made in 2005. The tender competition for the acquisition of the LTAVs is now in progress. The precise number of vehicles to be acquired will be confirmed at a later date. The cost of the LTAV programme will be evident only after the tender competition is held.</P>
        <P>A contract for the acquisition of the Javelin missile system from Raytheon-Lockheed Martin in the USA at a cost of some &euro;13 million, including VAT, will be fulfilled this year, with the main delivery due this summer. The purpose of the acquisition is to give Defence Forces personnel an effective anti-armour capability while on peace support operations. The system will replace the Milan system.</P>
        <P>On the general transport side, the focus will be on the purchase of 0.75-tonne trucks, trailers for <Col N="244"/>the DROPS vehicles, the purchase of a number of EOD trucks and some road ambulances for the Army Medical Corps.</P>
        <P>There have been ongoing programmes of acquisitions of both nuclear-biological-chemical, or NBC, equipment and night vision equipment, or NVE, in recent years, and those programmes will continue in 2005 to meet the ongoing requirements of the Defence Forces. That will include the purchase of a further 1,000 NBC suits this year and another 1,000 next year.</P>
        <P>The delivery of eight Pilatus training aircraft for the Air Corps at a total cost of &euro;60 million has been completed. The final-stage payment for the aircraft of &euro;7 million will be made this year. The focus for the Air Corps is now on the two contracts for helicopters for a total value of over &euro;61 million, which I had the pleasure of signing recently.</P>
        <P>Four Utility AB 139 helicopters are being acquired from the Bell Agusta Aerospace Company at a cost of &euro;48.4 million, including VAT. The four helicopters will be built at the Agusta facility near Milan, Italy. Two AB 139s will be delivered in 2006, and the other two will be delivered in 2007.</P>
        <P>Two light Utility EC 135 helicopters are being acquired from Eurocopter SAS at a cost of &euro;12.8 million, including VAT. The two helicopters will be built at Eurocopter&rsquo;s facility in Donauworth, Germany. Both EC 135s are scheduled to be delivered in the latter part of this year.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service has also benefited from the investment programme in recent years, with the acquisition of two new modern ships, LE <i>R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i> and LE <i>Niamh,</i> at a cost of some &euro;25 million each.</P>

	<P>The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs both at home and abroad.</P>
        <P>Currently, a total of 750 Defence Forces personnel are serving overseas.</P>
        <P>Ireland has offered, through the UN stand-by arrangements system, or UNSAS, to provide up to 850 military personnel, configured as a light <Col N="245"/>infantry mounted battalion, for overseas service at any one time. That figure equates to some 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s standing Army, excluding reserves, and demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace. That is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations. It should be appreciated that, at any one time, one group of personnel will have just returned from service, one will be on overseas duty, and a further group will be in training. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS.</P>

I understand that at present there are no plans to provide an additional eight weeks&rsquo; paid leave in respect of maternity leave.

Their report, entitled Assistance in Connection with the Proposed Introduction of a New Financial Manage<Col N="248"/>ment System, was furnished in December 2001. Following a further tender competition, the same consultants were employed to advise on the preparation of a specification for new systems and on the selection of a suitable vendor. Tenders for the provision of the new systems were invited in August 2003, and a contract for the systems was placed with Oracle EMEA in April 2004. The project is expected to be completed in 2006.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 265 and 266 together.</P>
        <P>Capital projects funded by my Department are, in the main, initiated by local authorities, save for a limited number of capital projects pertaining to the heritage programme.</P>
        <P>Generally, capital projects are funded by means of a grant for full costs or partly grant-funded, with the remaining costs funded from the sponsoring bodies&rsquo; own resources. Reflecting the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, it is public policy fully to recover the cost of providing waste management services to end users by means of charges levied on those users. In the case of services provided by the private sector directly, that is already the case. In the case of services and infrastructure provided directly by local authorities or by means of a public private partnership or outsourcing, significant progress is now being made towards full cost recovery on the basis of use-related charges. Similarly, the non-domestic element of water services infrastructure is financed by user charges.</P>
        <P>Local authorities at present have more than 5,000 individual capital projects at various stages of development. My Department does not have detailed information regarding many of those projects, and its compilation would involve a dis<Col N="250"/>proportionate amount of time and work. However, indicative information on housing, water services, non-national roads, waste, heritage and urban regeneration projects to be commenced over the period 2000 to 2006 has been set out in the national development plan. The 2005 public capital programme contains further details regarding planned capital expenditure on some 70 major housing, water services and non-national roads projects, each costing in excess of &euro;20 million. In addition, as they are announced, details of the various multi-annual programmes funded by my Department are made available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>While my Department oversees and provides the policy framework for its capital programmes, staffing allocated to the delivery of individual projects is a matter for the implementing bodies concerned, as is the commissioning of related reports and consultancies, etc.</P>
        <P>From 2004, the capital envelope agreement between my Department and the Department of Finance sets out aggregate capital provisions for our programmes over rolling five-year periods, with the most recent envelope covering the period 2005 to 2009 valued at some &euro;9 billion. Capital provisions beyond that period will be progressively determined.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the names of persons in the private sector who have met with or advised him or his predecessors over the past seven years in any capacity on infrastructure projects to be supported by public expenditure; the details of those meetings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I, and my predecessors, would have had extensive contacts and interactions with, and would have received advice or representations from, many persons in the private sector regarding infrastructural issues over the period in question. The detailed information sought in the question is not, however, readily available in the Department, and its compilation would require a disproportionate amount of time and work.</P>

	<P>An archaeological detection device licence for geophysical survey work at Killsallaghan, County Dublin, was issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 3 March 2005. The licence was issued to a geophysicist working on behalf of the Killsallaghan residents association. The Archaeological Survey of Ireland, which is under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, undertook an archaeological field survey at Killsallaghan in the townlands of Killsallaghan and Castlefarm on 8 October 1992. <Col N="253"/>The survey work was undertaken as part of the archaeological inventory of County Dublin. The ten archaeological sites which were identified were later listed for statutory protection in the record of monument and places, which was established under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994.</P>

	<P>The option of demutualisation is available to any building society under existing legislation. Two building societies have demutualised using those provisions. Current provisions preclude 15% or more of the shares in a successor company being held by an individual or institution for five years after demutualisation, unless the Central Bank directs in accordance with legislation that the provisions should not apply. A substantial amount of work has been done in respect of the amendment of building societies legislation, based on the recommendations of the review group on building societies legislation, which involved the building societies and relevant Departments. Decisions about legislation in this area will be matters for the Government on completion of this work.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In so far as the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is concerned, the main statutory authorities with responsibilities in respect of water quality are the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 obliges the agency to create maintain databases of information about environmental quality, including the quality of groundwater, to disseminate such information and to provide for public access to it. Detailed information about the quality of drinking water in Ireland is available in reports published annually by the EPA. The reports, which are based on the results of monitoring conducted by local authorities, health boards and the EPA, indicate the extent to which <Col N="254"/>drinking water supplies comply with prescribed quality standards. Comprehensive information about the quality of surface water and groundwater is available in reports published triennially by the EPA about water quality in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Local authorities have statutory responsibility for supplying drinking water and upholding the quality standards prescribed by the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2000. The regulations require that information and advice be made available to consumers about various matters, including the prohibition or restriction of supplies which constitute a potential danger to human health, for example, in the case of a polluted groundwater source.</P>
        <P>Persons who are concerned about the quality of water can seek advice from a supplier, a local authority, a health board, the EPA or an appropriate consultant or adviser. Information about accredited laboratories, other services available for sampling water and analysis of water samples under various parameters is available from local authorities, health boards and the EPA. Analysis of water samples can be conducted by local authorities or health boards which have appropriate in-house laboratory facilities, or can be arranged by such an authority on behalf of a householder at an accredited laboratory. Water samples can be submitted for analysis to the regional laboratories of the EPA, the Dublin city analyst&rsquo;s laboratory or other appropriate laboratory. The charges which will apply in respect of the provision of such services are matters for the service providers.</P>

        <P>Capital projects funded by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are mostly initiated by local authorities. The exceptions are a limited number of capital projects pertaining to the heritage programme. Some 187 staff in the Department are assigned wholly or partly to work that relates to supporting capital programmes, assessment, procurement, project management and the delivery of infrastructure projects under the public capital programme. I am satisfied that this allocation of staffing resources is adequate to delivering the elements of the public capital programme for which the Department is responsible.</P>
