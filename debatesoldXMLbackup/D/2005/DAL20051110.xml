    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent, public and national concern, namely, the necessity, in this men&rsquo;s cancer awareness week, to increase awareness among the male population of the urgent importance of making better use of preventative and primary care services at an earlier stage to promote early detection of cancer given that 6,500 men in Ireland are diagnosed with the most common male cancers annually &mdash; prostate, colorectal bowel and testicular cancer &mdash; the need to encourage men in all age groups to attend their general practitioner for regular check-ups or body NCTs even when they feel perfectly healthy and thus improve their long-term survival rates and, similar to national wills week, advocate the incentive of an annual free male medical check-up to coincide with men&rsquo;s cancer week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to facilitate the discussion of an issue of national importance, namely, the ongoing indecision in respect of An Post and the need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, at the first available opportunity, to debate the issue with a view to identification of the cause or causes, which have led to the dispute, and to a lasting resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of urgent importance, namely, the need for the Government to provide a significant child care package for both working and stay at home parents to enable them to access quality child care at a reasonable cost.</P>

	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the Government&rsquo;s ongoing failure to recognise and address this State&rsquo;s growing cocaine crisis despite increasing seizures, such as that in Loughlinstown two days ago, or to produce and resource a coherent plan to deal with the rising level of cocaine dealing and abuse in this State even though the consequences for communities are devastating.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 15, the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Report Stage (resumed) and Final Stage, to adjourn at 1.30 p.m. if not previously concluded; No. 17, the Employment Permits Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No. 18, the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are no proposals to put to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the reports of the appalling conditions being experienced in the mountains of Pakistan and the fact the Government considered sending personnel to tsunami stricken countries, will the Ministers for Finance and Foreign Affairs raise this matter with their European counterparts? With the approach of an apparently severe winter and truly appalling conditions, more needs to be done as a matter of urgency. Perhaps the Government will take that on board.</P>
      <P>Is it possible to indicate the commencement date of the western rail line from Ennis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The second question is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew the Ceann Comhairle would knock me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will allow the first question. I suggest the Deputy submits a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We all recognise the very serious situation in Pakistan as a result of the earthquake. I understand Ireland was the highest <i>per capita </i>contributor in the world in terms of financial assistance, of which we should all be proud. Obviously, the magnitude of the problems are <Col N="1631"/>such that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will send people to Pakistan to see how we can further assist the non-government organisations which are doing all they can to continue with a co-ordinated effort. I know time is running out and I share the concern of the leader of the Opposition in terms of doing all we can for a very stricken people who require the world&rsquo;s attention and assistance.</P>
      <P>The detailed implementation of Transport 21 is a matter to be put to the Minister for Transport on Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Northern Secretary, with what some would think a bizarre sense of timing, published legislation in the House of Commons concerning &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo;. The numbers seem to have exploded from the anticipated couple of dozen to a few hundred. Is the Minister satisfied that no legislation is required in this jurisdiction? Given the statutory independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the operational autonomy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is the Minister satisfied there is no constitutional infirmity in not introducing primary legislation in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice available to the Government is that there is no constitutional infirmity attaching to the proposal to set up an eligibility board which will subsequently determine for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform what cases will be submitted for pardon from the President under Article 13 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>How can someone who has not been convicted be pardoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate the matter. It does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a need for it. How can someone who has not been convicted be pardoned? That should be clarified at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Unless legislation is promised, the Deputy should table a question to the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is cherry picking again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday a member of one of the Government parties spoke about ending the special relationship with the Catholic Church. Does the Minister for Finance believe the Government has a special relationship with the Catholic Church?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1632"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise. I call Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should find another way to raise this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about promised legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Deputy is not. I will call him later on promised legislation only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>On another occasion, we will come back to the need for legislation to deal with the &ldquo;on the runs&rdquo;. However, the continuing delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the coroner&rsquo;s legislation, which has been in place for more than 40 years, is a more urgent matter. Reform in this area was recommended in a report five years ago. Legislation has been promised every year since the Government took up office but we still have not had sight of it. Yesterday, another problem arose in the Coroner&rsquo;s Court regarding attendance of medical witnesses at an inquest. Will the coroner&rsquo;s legislation be introduced as a matter of urgency instead of making another promise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the issues raised by the Deputy and this is a long-standing matter. Reform is required in updating the coroner&rsquo;s legislation. A Bill is in preparation to provide for reform of the coroners service and to replace the Coroner&rsquo;s Act 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I was told that, three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is due to be enacted next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I was also told that, three years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is present. Could he communicate to the Minister for Finance when he intends to bring the text of the building control Bill to Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that will happen shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>How short is a piece of string?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the extension of the higher level of fee payment from January until June to counsel involved in the tribunals affect the publication of the tribunals of inquiry <Col N="1633"/>Bill? Does the Minister expect it to be published before the end of this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The legislation will be published this session. It is not affected by the extension of payments, which is intended to facilitate the chairman of that tribunal to complete his inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Government intend to propose to deal with the unsavoury practice of Ministers advertising their wares in the media generally and upsetting the public on two levels, first, by invading their privacy and, second, by using public funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy is being disorderly. He raised the matter yesterday. Has the Deputy a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the Finance Bill, which can address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Unlike an unfortunate episode involving a previous Administration, we do not intend any leaks before the publication of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been involved in an unfortunate incident during his own tenure. What about Parlon country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>During the time the Minister for Finance served as Minister for Health and Children, the shortage of nurses was beginning to manifest itself. Is he aware the position has deteriorated significantly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The shortage is at an all-time high of 1,100 nurses, despite various initiatives. We have been waiting for the nurses Bill for quite some time. Will the Minister take the issue seriously enough to ensure sufficient nurses are in place and the legislation is introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be published next year. I am aware, that since my time in the Department, every effort has been made by An Bord Altranais and the Health Service Executive to provide adequate numbers of nurses. The number has increased since my time in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not delivering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two questions on promised legislation. First, are there legislative pro<Col N="1634"/>posals to end the so-called special relationship with the church?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy will have to resume his seat if he does not obey the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell has left town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the third level student support Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Education and Science hopes to publish that Bill next year. As the Deputy will be aware, legislation is not envisaged on the other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not know that; that is why I asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the draft constitutional treaty produced during our Presidency, it is the intention of all Governments in the European Union to continue legitimate dialogue with faith communities in their societies on the basis of a mature relationship, which we seek with all faiths in this pluralist society. It would be thoroughly illiberal if such a dialogue were not to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has promised to change the one-parent family payment to a totally new family friendly system. When will this happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of policy and changes in arrangements are provided for in the Social Welfare Bill but none are imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the promised legislation to establish TG4 on an independent statutory basis be brought before Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It will probably be introduced next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to crime in the Border area. The culprits are known and excellent video footage is available, but, unfortunately, they live in Northern Ireland and they are untouchable. They are terrorising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the crimes Bill be introduced to ensure cross-Border co-operation in criminal investigations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not possible to say at this stage. I will take note of the Deputy&rsquo;s comments <Col N="1635"/>and communicate them to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Ceann Comhairle probably knows, section 2 of the code of conduct for officeholders states, &ldquo;Holders of public office enjoy an enhanced public profile and should be mindful of the need to avoid the use of public resources in a way that could reasonably be construed as an inappropriate raising of profile in the context of a general election&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question on legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister for Finance ensure compliance with the code of conduct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business. The Deputy is being disorderly. The matter was dealt with yesterday and the Deputy knows how to deal with it if he wishes to pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister wants to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue is today&rsquo;s newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions relating to the code of conduct of officeholders have been raised on the Order of Business traditionally. I am merely asking the Minister for Finance if he will ensure&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is concerned about breaches of the code of conduct, which are dealt with by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no wish to refer my friend, the junior Minister, to the commission. I am asking the Minister for Finance for a statement of Government policy that, henceforth, he will ensure the code is complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has made a ruling that has been in place since the relevant legislation was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, personal statements were made in the House in previous instances of alleged breaches of the code of conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for any Member if he or she wishes to make a statement. He or she must notify the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office and time will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1636"/>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has been asked whether the practice is in accord with the code of conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order. Deputy Boyle has been called. I ask Deputy Durkan to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Asking me to resume my seat will not answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>We are observing a code of misconduct from Deputy Callely.</P>

	<P>Deputy Callely is on the rails.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Two documents laid before the D&aacute;il on today&rsquo;s Order Paper relate to proposals regarding the 7th Framework Programme 2007-2011 of the EURATOM Treaty. There is ongoing debate on a sunset clause in the European constitution so the EURATOM Treaty would go out of existence. Is there an opportunity to debate the need for this organisation and this country&rsquo;s involvement in a treaty that compromises our participation in debates on nuclear safety in other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Whips to arrange a debate on that or any other issue and if the Green Party wishes to promote this matter as a priority it can raise the matter on Private Members&rsquo; business if Government time is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the responsibility for the Whips to arrange debates in this House. The Government should make proposals that the Whips can discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Order of Business it is only appropriate to raise debates that have been promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>What Deputy Cowen said is not right and it is regularly stated. If Deputy Kitt does not receive instructions, there is nothing he can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never heard Deputy Stagg echo such a sense of powerlessness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Next week we will debate the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, presented three weeks ago. Following the comments of Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn in Brussels, will new legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>Concerning the central plank of the e-Government programme, does the Minister intend to <Col N="1637"/>make proposals on the waste and incompetence in the roll-out of the REACH programme? The Minister, the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip are ultimately responsible for REACH. Will the Minister make time available on the excellent report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not yet asked the question. Will the Minister make time available for the excellent report of the Committee of Public Accounts, drafted by Deputy Rabbitte, on a new system of Estimates, whereby Deputies could have an input into budgetary considerations? I ask in view of the fact the Minister did not answer some recent questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am available to answer questions at any time. The report of the Committee of Public Accounts is quite short, with an addendum including work by Deputy Rabbitte. I have read the report and it will be taken into account in the context of budgetary reform, to which I referred in my last budget speech. Yesterday, I discussed some aspects of this with Deputy Bruton. The principle of accountability refers to action taken by Government and accounted for to the Houses of the Oireachtas and its committees. It must remain the duty of the Government to propose the budgetary process and be held accountable thereafter.</P>
      <P>The e-Government programme is making progress, under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill will be debated as published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments will follow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we see legislation on property management companies? Is this legislation intended to apply only to apartment devel<Col N="1638"/>opments? Will it regulate the new agency due to established early next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 20, lines 2 and 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;it&rdquo; in line 2 down to and including &ldquo;determine&rdquo; in line 3 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;it&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) is published in such manner as the Council may determine, and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) is submitted to the Minister for laying before each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Following the Committee Stage debate, further consideration was given to the proposals to lay council rules and registration board by-laws before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am pleased to propose amendments dealing with this matter. Amendment No. 14 provides for the health and social care professionals council to publish its rules and submit them to the Minister for laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Section 95 deals with the Minister&rsquo;s power to make regulations and amendment No. 16 provides that subsections (4) to (6), inclusive, of section 95 apply with the necessary modifications to rules of the council submitted to the Minister <Col N="1643"/>in accordance with this section as if they were regulations made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 32 provides for the publication and other requirements relating to draft and other by-laws made by registration boards. Amendment No. 25 amends this section to provide for registration boards to publish by-laws and submit them to the Minister for laying before each House. Subsections (4) to (6), inclusive, of section 95 will apply with the necessary modifications to the by-laws of registration boards submitted to the Minister in accordance with this section and regulations made by the Minister. I trust this meets Deputy McManus&rsquo;s requirements and that in the circumstances she will appreciate that I do not propose to accept her amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity that the Minister of State does not accept my amendment No. 15 because it provides parliamentary accountability and a mechanism which is very reasonable. I am surprised that the Minister of State does not see it that way.</P>
      <P>We have a health service which is now stripped of almost all accountability. The systems in place under the former health board system provided for some kind of scrutiny, albeit flawed, at local level. We must now be very conscious that at national level there must be enhanced forms of accountability and that is the purpose of my amendment. I regret that the Minister of State will not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P FLI="0">I am pleased that this amendment has not been ruled out of order. We need transparency and openness. The register should be available and open for inspection by the public. That is what I seek to achieve in this amendment which inserts after the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo;, &ldquo;and each register shall be available for inspection by members of the public&rdquo;. That intent should be explicitly included in the terms of the Bill. If included, there can be no doubt as to the public&rsquo;s right of access and the guarantee of that right. I acknowledge that Deputy Twomey has presented a similar wording and on behalf of both of us I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment and live up to the spirit of transparency and openness essential in the progress of this legislation.</P>

	<P>I support the amendment in the names of Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Twomey. This is a reasonable proposal which should be uncontroversial. I do not see any reason the public should not be able to inspect the register. The amendment would facilitate openness and transparency. I do not understand why any professional would not be happy to have an inspection of the register with that professional&rsquo;s name on it. I cannot see any reason that should not be accepted and see many good reasons it should be on the basis of ensuring and greatly helping with the credibility of the register. On that basis I support the amendment.</P>

	<P>Regarding Deputy Neville&rsquo;s assertion that the register should be available for inspection by the public, the Medical Council register of doctors is available on-line. One can see if a doctor is registered with the Medical Council. Doctors did not object to their names being made public but to their home addresses being given on the register. They were agreeable to having their professional addresses listed. Accordingly, there is no problem in having the names of professionals listed with their professional addresses. People can then check to see that those people are on an official register rather than merely accepting what is indicated by plaques on professionals&rsquo; office walls.</P>

	<P>The issue of access to registers is already dealt with in the Bill. Section 46(1)(<i>a</i>) states that a registration board shall make its register available to members of the public at all reasonable times. This meets the requirements of both Deputies and therefore I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I am disappointed with the response of the Minister of State. I do not know if he has expressed his own view or if he is simply trundling out the text offered. As a member of the medical profession, Deputy Twomey has put the case well. That demonstrates clearly that not only I, as member of the public, and he, as a member of the medical profession, but a great many others believe that we should ensure full transparency and openness. That requires access to the register in all these cases. It is imperative.</P>
      <P>We had an earlier discussion regarding the listed professions under the terms of this legislation. There are people established in different areas of medical practice, not within the listed professions but among others to which I have alluded, in whose case a plaque on a wall is all it amounts to. There is no way in which the public can properly establish with ease the qualifications and suitability for practice of any person presenting. We have echoes of these difficulties with regard to the qualifications of people currently being addressed in the media. In this situation, a register should be open and a straightforward argument for such access deserves support. I cannot understand the rejection of the proposition by the Minister of State and I ask for his reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 46 of the Bill deals with access to and publication of registers. Section 46(1) states that a registration board shall:</P>

      <P LI="1">(<i>b</i>) publish, by electronic and not less than one other means, its register at intervals of not more than 12 months from the date of the establishment of the register or the last publication of the register.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) make or forward complaints to the Council under <i>section 51</i>,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The council overseas all 12 registration bodies, each of which receives and considers complaints. However, I understand that complaints are forwarded to the council only where the outcome is negative for a member. A list of all complaints made, regardless of their outcome, should be sent to the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 18 is concerned with the power of a registration board to make or forward complaints to the council and, under section 52(3), a complaint to the council may be made on behalf of any person or by a registration board. On that basis, the issue raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment is already provided for under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 19 concerns the accreditation and inspection of training course providers and the monitoring of trends and performances in health services. The education and training courses, rather than the providers of courses, should be accredited. Under section 48, a registration board may approve a training programme if it is satisfied that it is suitable for the education and training of candidates for registration or may refuse to approve the programme if it is not so satisfied. A registration board may issue guidelines concerning the requirements for its approval of education and training programmes. Section 49(1)(<i>a</i>) requires the registration board to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the education training, assessment and examination provided by any education and training programme approved by the board. Section 49(1)(<i>b</i>) requires the registration board to satisfy itself as to the clinical experience provided in any education and training programme approved by the board. Therefore, while the courses providers are not accredited, their courses are.</P>
      <P>With regard to research, under section 27(4), registration boards may, with the council&rsquo;s approval, engage in research into education and training relating to the practice of a designated profession, including the formulation of experimental curricula and the evaluation of existing programmes and examination and assessment <Col N="1647"/>procedures. The registration board may also maintain statistical records and make those records available for research and planning.</P>
      <P>The carrying out of research to monitor trends and performance outside the education field seems to be a function more proper to other bodies, such as the Health Service Executive, and it would not be appropriate to charge registration boards with this duty. I do not, therefore, propose to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 24, line 31, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 38(2)</i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 38(2)(a)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Section 38 provides for the granting of registration to applicants who comply with general requirements and hold qualifications approved by the registration board of a designated profession as attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration. It also provides for a registration board to take account of qualifications awarded in another European Union state and those awarded in states outside the EU. It was, however, indicated on Committee Stage that improvements to section 38 were being considered.</P>
      <P>The concern was that section 38 as it stood encompassed nationals of EU member states who were awarded qualifications in an EU member state but did not specifically encompass EU nationals who gained their qualifications outside the EU. While section 38 also took account of non-EU nationals who gained their qualifications outside the EU, it did not specifically encompass people who were not EU nationals and were awarded qualifications in an EU member state. It was therefore undertaken to bring appropriate amendments on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 27 amends section 38(2) to fully take into account qualifications approved by the registration board, whether such qualifications are awarded in this country, another European country or outside the EU. It also takes into account both EU nationals and non-nationals. In some cases, a qualification held by an applicant may be below the standard required, that is, a lesser qualification. However, the applicant may have undergone additional training or acquired experience which satisfies the registration board, following a test of competence, that he or she has a requisite standard of proficiency for registration.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment to define what is meant by &ldquo;lesser qualification&rdquo;. Amendment No. 29 is a technical amendment to delete a previous definition which is no longer required in the context of the substantive amendment to section 38(2). Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are technical amendments required as a result of changing section 38.</P>

      <P LI="2">53. The Council may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, irrespective of whether or not it has received a complaint, investigate any matter that appears to it to indicate that a registrant may have&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="3" Just="Left">(<i>a</i>) committed an offence, or</P>
      <P LI="3" Just="Left">(<i>b</i>) behaved in a manner that would contravene the grounds set out in section 52(1).</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is designed to give the council power to initiate investigations on complaints or matters of public interest. I am not sure if this issue is covered elsewhere in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the potential implications for a practitioner&rsquo;s livelihood, all decisions of the council in the disciplinary area are subject either to appeal or to confirmation by the High Court. It is clearly essential, in that regard, that the council behaves strictly in accordance with the principles of due process at all times. The fitness to practice procedures contained in the Bill are designed to differentiate clearly between the distinct and separate roles of the various constituent elements of the disciplinary process.</P>
      <P>The role of the council is broadly twofold in this matter. The council initiates the investigations of a complaint and, following the substantiation of a complaint against a registrant, it dictates an appropriate sanction based on the recommendation of the registration board.</P>
      <P>Conferring a broad power on the council itself to initiate a complaint, as proposed by Deputy Twomey, would circumvent the detailed fitness to practice system set out in the Bill and run the risk of rendering the disciplinary committees superfluous or, at least, confer a lower order of importance on them. It might also undermine the objective of the Bill to develop a more modern approach to the investigation of fitness to practice complaints through the introduction of a mediation route and allowing a practitioner to accept a complaint in order to preclude a full hearing in less serious cases. Moreover, there could be concern among practitioners regarding <Col N="1652"/>the scope for potential abuse of the complaints system in circumstances where an investigation could be commenced in the absence of a complaint being made.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy wishes to allow scope for the regulatory system itself to initiate a complaint against a registered practitioner. This area is covered in subsection (3) of section 52 of the Bill, which allows the registration board to make a complaint to the council. Therefore, the proposed amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <P FLI="0">While this is standard procedure, I would like to see this provision made explicit in the legislation.

I do not have a further amendment but presume it is taken as understood that in the event of a registrant, who is also a member of the council, having to absent himself or herself, that the exception regarding attendance at any meetings or discussions would be in the case of him or her being called before his or her peers. I presume that exception is understood and, given that, the proposition in amendment No. 35 is worthy of reflection in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, in response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Twomey, a commitment was made to consult the Parliamentary Counsel with regard to the drafting of an amendment, to be tabled on Report Stage, to the effect that a registrant who is a member of the council and becomes the subject of an inquiry should absent himself or herself from council discussions on the matter.</P>
      <P>However, I am not in a position to table this amendment because the advice I have received is that this issue is covered by the principles of natural justice and that the rules of natural justice are expected to be observed by the disciplinary body. These are the rules and procedures to be followed by any person or body with the duty of adjudicating on disputes between parties or when considering the rights of others. One of the main rules is that a person must not be a judge in his or her own cause.</P><Col N="1653"/>
      <P>The advice of the Parliamentary Counsel is that including the amendment could have the effect of disturbing the ordinary rules of natural justice that apply as a matter of course. The amendment could have the effect of freezing or limiting the other rules. Clearly, this is not what we wish to do. It also raises other issues, for example, specifying that a council member should absent himself or herself when the subjects of a complaints inquiry merely begs the question as to why we are not specifying that members should absent themselves when a relative or close friend is the subject of an inquiry. Clearly, absenting oneself in those circumstances would be a normal part of proper procedures. Section 59(4) refers to the necessity of observing fair procedures when receiving evidence so the issue raised by the Deputy is dealt with in the Bill. I hope the Deputy will appreciate my position on this matter and the fact that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>When we left off, I was speaking about the problems faced by non-nationals who have married Irish citizens and who are waiting for approval of their residency applications. As I said then, I continue to hear about the problems these couples face during the 16 to 18 months it takes for the residency application to be approved, primarily because the non-national spouse cannot work without a work permit during this time. Since last speaking on the <Col N="1655"/>Bill, a further case in the same area has been referred to me. This problem is prevalent and needs urgent address. I said previously, and I repeat, that 16 to 18 months is a long time for two adults, perhaps with dependants, to live on one income in Ireland today.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform states that this waiting period is necessary because some of these marriages turn out to be fraudulent. A reply I received recently from the Minister indicated that the large majority of these applications are granted, therefore, his argument about fraudulent marriages does not hold up. The small number of so-called fraudulent marriages does not justify the serious difficulty into which these couples are forced during that 16 to 18 months period. Both the United States and Britain, which have much greater problems with so-called fraudulent marriages than we have, allow non-national spouses to work while their applications are being processed and the decisions on their applications are pending. The Minister&rsquo;s statistics demonstrate that there is no reason for us to be stricter than either the United States or Britain. These spouses should be able to avail of the relaxed scheme that currently exists for spouses of highly skilled migrant workers. There should be no discrimination or distinction. People should be treated equally.</P>
      <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> that there are plans to grant employment rights to spouses of migrant workers. I look forward to hearing the detail of this proposal, which appeared yesterday. I hope it will apply to spouses of all migrant workers. This is one of the changes I called for earlier in my contribution to this debate. I ask whatever Minister makes the closing statement to Second Stage to give a full account and explanation of what is intended, as reported in yesterday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Some aspects of the Bill are welcome. It is good that work permits will now be issued directly to employees, even though giving employees a document is not the same as giving them control over their labour. It is not what we asked for and the Government has acted somewhat cynically in its use of language in this regard. That said it is a positive step as far as it goes. It is also a good thing that information on the employee&rsquo;s rights will be included on the permit. This will make it more difficult for unscrupulous employers &mdash; regrettably there are far too many of them in Irish society &mdash; to exploit and mistreat their workers, at least those who can understand English or have access to a translator. I do not doubt that some exploitation will continue. We have only to remember the scandalous events of last weekend in which 13 migrant workers, EU nationals, who are here as of right and do not need work permits, were abandoned by their employer on an uninhabited island. That matter has been well aired in the House during recent days.</P><Col N="1656"/>
      <P>Incidents such as this will continue until we begin to take seriously the problem of exploitation of migrant workers and put real measures in place to address the problems. It is not enough simply to pass laws prohibiting exploitation without making statutory provision for resources to enforce those laws. I emphasise the need for enforcement given that there is no such provision in this legislation. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to take that issue on board and have it reflected in the response to Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister or Ministers, as is the case this morning will take some of these points into account in their preparation for Committee Stage. It is very difficult for Opposition members sometimes to have positions taken on board adopted by Ministers on Committee Stage. It would be much more agreeable and facilitativeif the proposing Minister were to take on board the points made by Deputies on Second Stage and reflect them in their amendments on Committee Stage. I do not want to go back to my immigrant constituents when the Bill has passed and tell them it took us two and a half years and that this is the best we can do. We can do much better. My purpose in raising the specific points I raised both on the last day we addressed Second Stage and again this morning is that I hope they will be taken on board and reflected by the Minister in the Government&rsquo;s position on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>There are provisions within the Employment Permits Bill which are to be welcomed. However, the Bill needs a good deal of work and my Fine Gael colleagues, particularly Deputy Hogan, will table numerous amendments on Committee Stage. The Bill does not provide sufficient protection for workers. Only last week, off the coast of Dublin, a group of Latvian workers were abandoned without protection. This is an indication of the regard employers have for people who do invaluable work. We are fast gaining the appalling reputation of a country that exploits its foreign migrants. We certainly rely on and need foreign labour, given the growth in the economy, the dependence on small companies and the level of services on which the economy depends from construction to the services sector. The huge growth in the economy is driven by the services sector. Without foreign labour our roads would not be built, our service industries would collapse and our booming economy would be lost. The retail trade and the catering sector in hotels are dependent on such labour. People from inside and outside Europe do a fantastic job in growing the Irish economy, particularly in the area of tourism which is very evident. The foreign workers coming into Ireland could easily find another more hospitable host. I am not saying that is the general rule as there are some good <Col N="1657"/>employers who do invaluable work. The biggest asset in any company is not equipment, machinery or property but its investment in personnel. Any company that wants to survive and make long-term profits will invest in personnel as it is their contribution to the bottom line that makes the difference. That is not to mention the shame brought on this country by those who have mistreated foreign workers from sheer greed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision whereby fines of up to &euro;50,000 or jail terms of five years can be imposed on employers found guilty of exploiting migrant workers. I hope this will act as a deterrent to employers to mistreat migrant workers. The principal change needed in the Bill was a provision whereby workers would hold their own work permits. It is important that they have autonomy and are not subjected or tied by contract to an employer. However, the Bill allows for the employer applying for a permit to continue. That is not good enough and will have to be reconsidered. Foreign workers coming to Ireland should not be ring-fenced to one employer. If they get a better option or are approached by another employer they should be allowed move if they so wish. It gives the employer too much power over what is already a legally vulnerable person. For example, the worker is not able to directly access information on why a permit was granted or refused. When one goes to Davitt House there is a difficulty in getting permits. Because of the level of appeals many people are intimidated. Everybody, regardless of origin, should have power over their own employment. People should be able to own their own permission to work, independent of their employer.</P>
      <P>Stories brought to my attention on the abuse of workers&rsquo; rights are truly frightening. That is not to say all employers behave in this fashion. On the contrary the majority of Irish employers treat migrant workers as fairly as they treat Irish employees. However, there is a minority and we need provisions included that will protect migrant workers from that minority.</P>
      <P>Among the many bodies to have criticised the lack of protection measures for migrant workers are IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The ICTU has given out a number of case studies to show the awful positions in which migrant workers find themselves, through no fault of their own. One asylum seeker speaks of working on a farm for &euro;2 per hour, picking stones. That is like penal times. There are always exceptional cases. Another man, a chef, started working in an hotel for &euro;2 per hour. I cannot understand how that is tolerated. The employer should be dealt with decisively. It is shameful that we are standing by while this sort of behaviour is taking place. The Small Firms Association, RGDATA and all the representative bodies have a critical role to play and I no have doubt they are playing it. That is important given that the <Col N="1658"/>nation has had massive gains in the services sector, which is where the major abuses appear to be as well as in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>One of the major tests facing Irish people today is how we treat migrant workers. Until recently it was Irish people who had to look overseas for work but that has completely changed which is welcome. Although this is frequently mentioned in the media and in the House it is not something we seem to fully acknowledge. Irish people may, on occasion, have been mistreated abroad but working abroad also provided much-needed funds to families at home. This happened in the 1970s, 1980s and in earlier decades. In the majority of cases people got work in the UK and were treated well.</P>
      <P>We need to recognise how hard it is for migrant workers to leave their own countries and their families to come here. In the same way Irish people found it hard for generations. There should be a level of compassion where families can come here on holiday visas. In certain cases where they have return tickets, validated by funds in a bank, the Government can be heartless in not allowing people to come here to meet family friends, particularly the immediate family.</P>
      <P>Another major failing is the way this Bill deals with the families of migrant workers. Why does the Bill make no reference to the spouses and families of workers? When green cards are issued, they should be given to families, not to individuals. However, the Bill only allows for individuals to apply for green cards. With this measure we are seriously limiting the number of quality candidates who come here to work. More importantly we are consigning to a life of misery those who do not come with their families. The Government has missed a huge opportunity.</P>
      <P>This legislation will also exacerbate a two-tier system of employment in this State. It allows for a new type of permit to be issued. This permit will be given to skilled staff in mainly high-tech sectors where labour shortages are deemed to exist. These green cards will allow holders the full freedom to seek jobs within specified areas of the economy. While such workers may be able to apply for citizenship after five years in the State, they have no guarantee of being successful. As we are aware, it could take many years before such a decision is made. Such an approach will allow certain immigrants to be seen as more preferable, more welcome by the State and more entitled to rights. This will further exacerbate the problem of exploitation and will also discourage certain workers from coming here.</P>
      <P>The tourism and construction industries are two of the biggest employers of migrant workers. As low-fares airlines become even more popular and cheaper, we need to boost the tourism industry further. This does not involve discouraging staff from working here. According to the National Competitiveness Council we are cur<Col N="1659"/>rently ranked 13th out of 16 countries in terms of perceived quality of infrastructure, which has a direct impact on competitiveness and performance. We need to invest heavily in our infrastructure, including road, rail and port development. In Sligo I very much hope the western rail corridor will re-open in the near future. Such developments are vital for the growth of this country and for the quality of life for current and future generations.</P>
      <P>In order to build all these projects we need labour. We already import a large proportion of labour in the construction industry where we have developed a bad reputation. More than 40% of migrant workers who come to Ireland are from Poland. Some weeks ago the Polish edition of <i>Newsweek</i> magazine described Ireland as a &ldquo;living hell&rdquo; for Polish workers. What would we do if the number of Polish workers coming here were to drop drastically? The percentage of Irish people between the ages of 15 and 34 is approximately 31%. Within 20 years that figure is expected to drop to below 24%. Irish people over the age of 65 currently comprise 11% of the population. Within 20 years that will have doubled to 22%. We are in dire need of foreign labour and we will need it even more in the coming decades.</P>
      <P>It appears futile to appeal to the human and compassionate side of the Government. The forward-thinking and logical side of the Government seems to be just as arrogant. We need migrant workers now and we will continue to need them for many decades to come. The level of immigrants coming into this country is already declining. We urgently need legislation that will help both migrant workers and Irish people. We need to learn from the mistakes other countries have made and from successful policies which have worked abroad.</P>
      <P>There are no international best practices in managing labour immigration that Ireland could import wholesale. Canada is often cited as an example of a country with a successful immigration system and it is a system worth analysing further. However, immigrant skills there are often not fully availed of. A recent study found that foreign-educated immigrants in Canada earned $2.4 billion less than native-born Canadians with comparable skills. This is because immigrants often end up working in occupations that are below their skill levels. Many well-educated and highly skilled people are coming into this country. We need to use their skills in a way that is beneficial to both parties.</P>
      <P>While the Employment Permits Bill is a step in the right direction, it also represents a lost opportunity, as it is not enough in itself. I hope that substantial amendments will be made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1660"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. While there has been considerable criticism of Ireland&rsquo;s policy for dealing with immigrants, we are beginning to introduce policies in a reasonably coherent fashion. The Employment Permits Bill represents another stage in bringing coherence to the issue of work permits and the integration of new communities into society. Given that the legislation is being discussed during Irish anti-racism in the workplace week and during the second week of riots in France by youths of immigrant origin, it is timely to talk about immigration and work permits. While we are discouraged from mixing the two matters, whether we like it or not a certain link exists. These events, together with events in Skerries in recent days, represent a sobering reminder of what can go wrong if sound policies, both social and economic, are not pursued to integrate immigrants and to ensure that they do not suffer from economic exclusion and social deprivation.</P>
      <P>While I want to speak on the specifics of the Bill before us, I also take the opportunity to speak on a number if issues surrounding migrant workers and their families. Everyone agrees that migrant workers have contributed immensely to our economy in recent years. Most economists predict that with projected growth rates of between 4% and 5% in coming years we will continue to need more migrant workers to sustain our economy. We need to look at migrant workers as being equal in every sense to the workers that come from our indigenous community in terms of rights, pay rates and conditions of work.</P>
      <P>One of the most serious problems for migrant workers is their inability to obtain permission to bring their immediate families to live with them. They are repeatedly asked to prove they are economically capable of looking after their families. Through sheer hard work some have saved up to &euro;20,000 but are still told they do not satisfy the criteria and will not get permission to bring their families to live with them. I have heard of many such cases in my constituency and I am dealing with a number of them at present. Trying to bring their families here has been a nightmare for some heads of households. They needed to apply many times before being successful. No criteria are defined as to the amount of money required to be on deposit and the granting of permission seems to be totally at the whim of an official. I regard the provisions in the Bill in this respect as extremely positive.</P>
      <P>Family reunification is extremely important. It is good for Irish society and extremely good for the family. It is imperative for children to live with both parents. If time allows me I will later outline an issue that came to my attention recently. While it relates more to refugees rather than migrant workers, I may outline what I have in mind.</P><Col N="1661"/>
      <P>The present situation does not make sense. Allowing good hard-working people to have their families with them would be of benefit to the country. It would add to the stability of the workers&rsquo; lives and help them to integrate more into society, something at which they are good. I was at an event in my constituency last night commemorating people who had passed away in the past year. Many of the new Irish community attended, as they wanted to be part of the celebration given that they come from a similar religious background.</P>
      <P>We must accept that if we allow migrant workers into the country for our own selfish reasons purely to sustain and expand our economy, we must also extend to them the most basic human rights. They must have the right to move from employer to employer and above all the right to live with their families. This time last year concern was expressed that workers from the new accession countries would flood this community. They have come here in great numbers and are extremely welcome. They have come from particular countries to work in different areas. The Polish workers are almost synonymous with the construction industry and workers from Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania would be more associated with the horticultural industry. They make a huge contribution. There is no point in pretending that a large influx of new workers into any area does not pose problems. The problems range from housing and school provision to policing and must be looked at in the wider context of overall policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister is producing a guide to rights in eight or ten languages, which gives a clear indication of the countries of origin of the majority of migrant workers. I call on him to also consider a review of our embassy structures in those countries. Facilities should be put in place in each embassy to vet and issue visas and to issue holiday visas to extended families and friends of migrant workers living here. Controls are necessary, but if we had a visa processing facility in the country of origin, it would ensure that only families and friends would be able to visit and enjoy their time here. I suggest that if some of these controls had been in place this time last year, the exploitation of the Gama workers in my constituency would not have happened to the extent it did. With proper documentation obtained from Irish Embassies in the country of origin, there should be no confusion for people arriving on this island. They should receive the traditional Irish c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte, not an interrogation at the point of arrival.</P>
      <P>When we invite workers into this country, we must accept that many families will remain, just as the Irish did in the US, England and Australia. While they will be proud of their ethnic background, I hope they will become involved in our culture and sports and that just as the Irish inte<Col N="1662"/>grated into society in England and the United States, migrant workers and their families will become part and parcel of our society. If we can reciprocate the kind of welcome that was, by and large, accorded to Irish emigrants to the US, Canada and different parts of the United Kingdom, we will find it a rewarding experience.</P>
      <P>In passing, I was heartened to see our Minister for Foreign Affairs work so hard in America over the past number of weeks on the issue of the undocumented Irish. Two weeks ago, wearing my hat as Chairman of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I was in London to meet the federation of Irish societies and examine some of the issues pertinent to Irish emigrants living in Britain, some for a long time. The issues for them are quite different to the issues for new arrivals in this country. Nevertheless, issues for them, such as repatriation, entitlement to housing here, wider availability of social welfare provision etc. need to be resolved.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Bill will help to achieve balance. It is only natural for Irish workers to feel some insecurity when they see action such as that taken by Irish Ferries. They know that in recent years unscrupulous employers exploited migrant workers and forced a situation that if left unchecked would eventually lead to a downward trend in general wages in the country. The Government and all parties are doing their best to ensure we avoid this race to the bottom. The Irish Ferries issue highlights this more starkly than most. In this regard, the Bill is essential. Not only must it protect the rights of migrant workers, it must also instil confidence in Irish people that the immigration process is being controlled in a way that will benefit the economy and not undermine the job prospects of Irish people.</P>
      <P>I mention in passing the appalling treatment and abandonment of the periwinkle workers on the island off Skerries. The perpetrators, boat owners and everybody else associated with that must be brought to book quickly. There are 24 different agencies dealing with this area, but if no agency has ultimate responsibility, the attitude of pass the parcel will apply. The welfare of such workers must be paramount, whether they are periwinkle or construction workers. Thankfully, because of trade union campaigns construction workers are treated much better now than they were this time last year. I saw some of the accommodation conditions provided for the Gama workers in Ballymun and they were quite harrowing. They were similar to what Irish workers were dealt in the 1950s and 1960s where they had to live in the equivalent of Nissen huts. This legislation will put a stop to all of that.</P>
      <P>The Bill will be useless if it is not enforced properly. We must have inspectors to ensure the rights of immigrant workers and to track down and prosecute unscrupulous employers. We should consider recruiting some inspectors from <Col N="1663"/>the immigrant community, many of whom have the language and education skills required. There is a perception abroad that immigrants are illiterate and uneducated; they are anything but. I have met some highly skilled and articulate immigrants who are forced to work in situations where their talents are not exploited to the full. Just as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has suggested recruiting garda&iacute; from ethnic minorities, we should recruit buildings and workplace inspectors the same way.</P>
      <P>There must be constant monitoring by the Department to ensure that quotas are kept at a level in each sector that guarantees the continued expansion of the economy without infringing on the job prospects of indigenous Irish people. This is where problems will arise. There is a perception that we will never get anything right in the area of immigration or refugee policy. However, if we pursue the current policy, the exploitation of workers will not arise to the extent people fear.</P>
      <P>The Irish economy needs migrant workers to survive and grow. When the suggestion was made to drop the groceries order, I heard comments that many small shopkeepers now use migrant workers and just pay the minimum wage or a little above it. It is not helpful to associate any industry, whether the retail or any other, with low pay or with particular communities. The success we will have as a community will be if we manage to integrate workers well with our indigenous community. If we ever wanted a lesson in what not to do, we should watch current reports on television covering the rioting throughout France, which I thought had some of the most enlightened social and economic policies of any country. If we go down the road of forced integration, we will have great difficulties.</P>
      <P>While it might be of more concern to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, an issue was brought to my attention recently that is important. It appears that a cohort of people, approximately 400 males whose spouses were here under the parents of an Irish born child rule, have come here since 30 March this year. I have mentioned to some of the agencies dealing with these people that I have come across cases of husbands being made to live under direct provision in a hostel on the south side of this city, while their wives and children live in private accommodation in respect of which rent supplement is paid. If they are to preserve a semblance of family unity, the husbands to whom I have spoken need to leave the hostel very early in the morning &mdash; between 6.30 a.m. and 7 a.m. &mdash; so that they can accompany their wives and children in travelling to school together as a family. They engage in this charade so that their children think their parents live together in the apartment.</P>
      <P>The husbands in question have to sign on at the centre with which we are all familiar before <Col N="1664"/>9.45 a.m. They can return to be with their wives for the rest of they day, but they have to be back in the hostel by 9 p.m. That is no way to deal with people. While I accept that this matter relates to immigration and refugee policy more than it relates to employment policy, I decided to take this opportunity to speak about it nonetheless.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Employment Permits Bill 2005, which will add to the body of legislation in this area. It will be good for the Irish economy and it will assist new immigrant workers. Like much of our employment legislation, it will stand the test of time. I hope it will be used as a model of best practice in other countries in the EU and beyond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Employment Permits Bill 2005. I agree with Deputy Carey&rsquo;s closing remarks about the many anomalies within the existing immigration legislation. Such matters are more properly categorised as being under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than that of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. That the spouses and partners of people who have been granted refugee status are obliged to stay in separate accommodation from their families is one such anomaly. The spouses and partners in question may be located in Tralee or somewhere else down the country rather than in Dublin. The Government has made limited attempts to pursue a humanitarian approach to the cases of couples who have to live separately, as well as the cases of fathers who have to live separately from their children. This anomaly needs to be ironed out.</P>
      <P>The second anomaly in the system to which I would like to refer relates to those known as &ldquo;aged out minors&rdquo;. I am sure Deputy Carey is familiar with the cases of such people, many of whom live on the north side of Dublin city. There is a large cohort of aged out minors in the O&rsquo;Connell School, in particular. I would like to discuss the cases of people who are attending secondary school but are not yet aged out. When they reach the age of 18, they will no longer be subject to the normal education system. Instead, they will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the asylum system, if an appropriate application is made. I understand that approximately 250 people in this country, who came here as orphans without any adult supervision, are in such a state of limbo. When they complete their second level education by sitting the leaving certificate, they will be treated as if they were starting from scratch. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who should consider such people as being in a separate category. The circumstances of the small number of people to whom I refer could be regularised without having a very strong impact on the system.</P><Col N="1665"/>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, the purpose of the Bill before the House is to provide a framework for granting work permits to non-nationals to allow them to work in Ireland. Under the Bill, such permits will be granted to people who can fill existing skill shortages. A large number of permits will be granted to people who are high up the skills ladder. The number of permits granted will decrease significantly, however, in the cases of those who are lower down the skills ladder. The permit policy of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is entirely based on a migration policy which, as he has said, &ldquo;targets individuals possessing a high level of scarce skills&rdquo; and who &ldquo;can have a significant positive impact on economic performance&rdquo;. The Minister&rsquo;s policy derives from and reflects a position of economic smugness, namely, that a strong economy can and should dictate terms to all those from weaker economies who may wish to work in it.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about a visit I made to Lithuania some weeks ago. It is interesting that there is a daily flight to Vilnius from Dublin. Lithuania is the country of origin of the second largest number of citizens from the ten new accession states who have come to work in Ireland. Some 9% of those who have come to Ireland from other EU member states are Lithuanian. Poland is the only country from which more people have arrived. I presume that people from those countries are most likely to come to Ireland because they are Catholic countries, like Ireland. Latvia also has a significant percentage of Catholics, although the proportion is not as high as in Lithuania. Lithuania&rsquo;s GDP of &euro;12,000 is approximately one quarter of Ireland&rsquo;s GDP of just under &euro;40,000. There was just a handful of passengers on my flight to Vilnius from Dublin. On the flight home from Vilnius, however, most of the seats were packed with bright young <?oasys _ch?>Lithuanians in their 20s and 30s. A generation of young Lithuanian people is migrating and perhaps emigrating forever. They have been drawn from a weak economy with few job opportunities to a strong economy with extensive job opportunities.</P>
      <P>When I visited a teaching hospital in Vilnius, I caused a degree of merriment when I asked how long people have to wait on accident and emergency waiting lists or on trolleys. In Lithuania, &ldquo;accident and emergency&rdquo; means just that &mdash; patients are dealt with immediately because waiting lists for accident and emergency services or operations do not exist in Lithuania, a country with a GDP of just &euro;12,000. A weak economy does not mean a weak society. Medical and hospital services in eastern Europe are years ahead of those in Ireland. However, the salaries of general practitioners, university lecturers and consultants are quite similar to each other, at approximately &euro;100 per week. I learnt that most <Col N="1666"/>students in Lithuania are learning English, French or a Scandinavian language so that when they qualify, they will have the language skills to work outside their own country.</P>
      <P>People like the Minister, Deputy Martin, want to pick and choose the best and brightest individuals from such countries solely as they relate to Ireland&rsquo;s economic needs and skill shortages from time to time. Such people will deem the workers from other countries to be expendable when the job opportunities dry up, so they will repatriate them and cancel their permits. The Minister&rsquo;s policy is one of narrow national economic selfishness. It is based on the German concept of the guest worker, the <i>gastarbeiter</i>. I notice that the Minister of State is shaking his head.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is trying to muddy the waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>We will come to that. As I have said, a narrow economic consideration of this country&rsquo;s skills needs is the basic tenet of the Government&rsquo;s policy in this regard. The Government is not operating on the basis of a wider policy framework. The long-standing <i>laissez-faire</i> policy of the western world, which caused Irish citizens to suffer throughout the 20th century, is now being pursued in this country. Such a policy does not involve any consideration of its effects on the countries of origin of migrant workers. I refer to its effects on health and education services, for example, as well as on the overall fabric of the societies in question. Above all, it does not involve any consideration of the circumstances of individuals, who are treated as objects or automatons. If a country is robbed of its young and educated professionals, it will be left to stagnate. Its young and sick people will be deprived of essential services and its old people will be deprived of their pensions. Are we doomed to repeat the flawed policies which ensured that Ireland remained an impoverished country for 150 years, while its citizens built the houses, highways and economies of Great Britain, Australia and the United States? Surely there is a better and more humane way of dealing with this issue. It is important that we regulate our work permit policy, but first and foremost it is necessary that we have a migration policy which deals with the movement of people, not simply the movement of jobs.</P><Col N="1667"/>
      <P>Last month, Mr. John Dunne, chief executive of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Employment that the current system treats migrant workers as disposable labour, simply filling a short-term gap. I am sure the Minister has been made aware of that. Individual skilled workers matching individual skill shortages is the wrong way to go. The Minister appears to have relied heavily on the recently published report of the Forf&aacute;s expert group, Skills Needs in the Irish Economy: The Role of Migration, which promotes this narrow labour market approach. The Minister should rethink his approach. He should learn the lessons from the past and avoid the temptation to think that might means right and that the spoils of the marketplace can be plundered in the same way that the spoils of war were plundered by conquering armies in the past. The Minister&rsquo;s policy is wrong because it is discriminating. It picks and chooses only the brightest and best from countries which can ill afford them to leave. It is nothing more than a recruitment service for temporary positions vacant in Ireland Incorporated. When those scarce skills have been picked from eastern Europe the Minister will go to the rest of the world and pick them from Third World countries.</P>
      <P>A totally new and holistic approach is required. It is true that the labour market here will determine our needs in terms of work permits but two things must be done before we start to mix and match. First, the labour market is not an independent, free wheeling mechanism outside our control. It is driven and regulated by State investment, tax incentives and internal and external markets. The &euro;46 billion national development plan approved in 2002, not to speak of the &euro;34 billion transport plan announced last week, have a significant impact on infrastructural projects such as road and bridge building in particular. Extensive tax incentives have a major impact on the building of houses, hotels, nursing homes, and so on. The construction industry is booming and the Government is pouring fuel on the fire.</P>
      <P>Paddy Punch, a respected economist, has predicted that if we continue as we are until the year 2025, within a single generation we will have a non-national population of people not born in Ireland amounting to between 25% and 33.3%. Clearly, a small homogeneous country like Ireland cannot receive unlimited numbers of foreign nationals without experiencing severe social strains, the creation of ethnic ghettoes, a rise in antagonism, hostility and downright racism or providing oxygen to right wing parties and individuals. The experience of France which has a non-national population of approximately 11% is a tragic reminder of how a society can fester and explode when it isolates and rejects its migrant workers and immigrants and fails to assimilate <Col N="1668"/>them. It is time for the Government to address the lopsided nature of our economic boom, to eliminate the let-it-rip mentality and to plan and chart our economic progress.</P>
      <P>Second, we must conduct a regular and comprehensive analysis of the labour market to determine our present and future needs. In reality, the needs of our economy are not to be found in the area of high skills but in the area of low skills. The building industry, the catering industry and agri-business are the main centres of employment in Ireland. Virtually all of these are low skilled sectors that employ manual rather that white collar workers. Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s sole policy of matching individual employee&rsquo;s skills with individual employer&rsquo;s needs cannot work as a general rule. The broader unskilled labour market requires a pool of workers who can and should be recruited on a much wider and more generous basis where willingness and availability to work are the key criteria. The Minister should revisit the core of this legislation.</P>
      <P>An immigration agency should be set up which would allow people to be recruited in different countries and these people would participate in a proper green card system. Potential employees abroad could apply at a consulate or embassy or directly to a Department. Preferential status could be given to applicants who have ethnic communities already rooted in Ireland. A favoured nation approach could be taken that reflects our overseas development aid policy.</P>
      <P>We could also favour countries like Argentina that are in dire economic straits, and where there is a large Irish community dating from the 19th century. Argentina constantly bombards the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to allow preferential status in terms of allowing its nationals to come here or to provide rights based on its citizens having great-grandparents from Ireland.</P>
      <P>National quotas could be put in place and the successful applicants would receive work visas entitling them to work here for a fixed number of years. If this arrangement was considered satisfactory and there was no criminal involvement, the visas could be renewed and these workers could if they wished be on a pathway to permanent residency, which is denied in the present system. The green card here is not a green card in terms of what it provides. The immigration agency could manage the process. This system would have the further beneficial effect of dealing with the present chaos which besets the asylum process whereby economic refugees have no choice but to apply for asylum in the hope that they will eventually be allowed to remain here and work. This new system would allow for asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution to be processed in a fair, firm, efficient, speedy and transparent manner. The present chaotic system <Col N="1669"/>that is the asylum process could be unclogged and streamlined.</P>
      <P>Whatever system the Minister ends up with, he must recognise that everything has changed. The situation has changed utterly in terms of the profile of the population in Ireland now and in the future. In the 1990s the majority of immigrants were Irish people repatriating from Britain, the US and Australia. They filled the new job opportunities that presented from the Celtic tiger. Last year that category still remained the highest single profile of immigrants, at approximately 28,000, but it was followed by Poland with 17,000. Furthermore, it is a rapidly decreasing percentage of our new immigrants. Pressures of accommodation present for all immigrants but for non-nationals the problems are much greater.</P>
      <P>There is a need for training, language courses, education, awareness and cultural understanding. There is also a need to promote a positive view of immigrants as a boon not a burden, a blessing rather than a curse. State agencies must be proactive in promoting good race relations, equality, cultural diversity and understanding among our own people. A forum must be created for interaction and consultation with the new communities of immigrants to welcome and integrate them. I have never seen any refugee or asylum seeker socialising in a public house and it is difficult to find them participating in the social scene in general. The same is true with immigrant workers coming from eastern Europe. They are not integrated in any way into our social scene. They operate separately from Irish people. We are not doing what we should to integrate immigrants. Multiculturalism and inter-culturalism must be promoted. Those who come to work here, obey the laws and leave should be equally welcome whether they wish to integrate or not. The challenge for us is to develop policies and structures and to manage immigration in a productive and humanitarian matter. It will not be done by the narrow robotic tenets in the Employment Permits Bill. I suggest we establish the status of immigrants who have come to this country over the past ten years. To the best of my knowledge, no survey has been done covering areas such as accommodation, payment, integration, employment, length of time spent here and the number who have put down roots here.</P>
      <P>I heard what the Minister said about bringing forward legislation to introduce a proper green card. I then heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come up with his own proposals. I believe he has wandered into the Minister&rsquo;s territory. He said he will allow the reunification of families based on their ability to support themselves. I would have thought that was a decision for the Minister but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has promised proposals in the next two weeks or so. Will the spouses of those who have got permits to <Col N="1670"/>come to this country be allowed to come here? Many people working here are separated from their families. They cannot get a visa so that family members may visit. It is a big humanitarian issue which is not addressed in this legislation or elsewhere. Perhaps the Minister would take a leaf out of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s book as he is quick to table amendments to legislation. Rather than introduce another Bill down the line, the Minister should table amendments to this legislation in regard to the green card and family reunification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill, to raise some of the issues that concern us in regard to this and other Bills which will be brought before us from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to reflect on the experience to date in terms of what has happened in the marketplace and what jobs are available and of those who have come to this country to fill these jobs and their experience of living here. There is no doubt the market has changed. There are new demands on employers and on this country to ensure a wider range and a greater pool of skills are available to ensure that, regardless of the job, whether on the bottom or the top rung of the ladder, there is a pool of qualified, skilled workers from which to draw.</P>
      <P>Following the accession of the new member states, more than 90,000 people have come here to seek employment. The experience of people arriving on our shores generally leaves much to be desired, particularly of those who have come through the asylum process. I do not want to confuse one process with the other but we must look at both experiences. Having considered the experiences of those in my constituency, I would have to say this Bill is timely because the system in operation is completely out of date and does not reflect what this country is about.</P>
      <P>When family members of many people working here on work permits, and who have permission to be in the State to work, turn 18 years of age, they must seek a permit themselves by leaving and returning or they must leave the country. That is causing great distress for families of highly skilled workers. These families have come here to put down roots. Some of them have received poor advice from their country of origin. These people who arrive here, take up employment, make a contribution, decide to stay, more or less, permanently and have their permits renewed face the experience of their families being divided and family members having to leave. I would like that issue addressed in the Bill, that is, that there is continuity for those living here and comfort for family members who wish to stay.</P>
      <P>I refer to work permits being issued to employers. In the past two weeks I came across a case in my constituency where an employee, who had been here since 2001, left it to the employer <Col N="1671"/>to apply for the permit but the employer did not do so. Having been in the country illegally for 12 months, the employee must regularise his situation for the immigration officer in Kilkenny and ensure the permit is regularised if at all possible. The process must be simplified because we require people to work at all levels of the workforce yet we seem to make it very difficult for them to participate in, enjoy and extend their employment and to bring their families here.</P>
      <P>We have attracted quite a number of people to come here to take up employment in the health service. In recent months I have come across cases where people have decided to get married here but their families have been refused visas to enable them to attend. If we are to allow people to come to the State to work, even within this new system, we must ensure there is greater flexibility, whether in the Department of Justice, Equality or Law Reform or the Minister&rsquo;s Department, so that family members who wish to travel here for legitimate reasons, whether for a visit, family occasion or otherwise, are allowed to do so without being put through the wringer, as it were, in regard to their applications. If a person is refused a visa, he or she must go through the process again to ensure his or her appeal is successful. If it is not included in this Bill, I propose a certain amount of flexibility, since we are in a time of change, relative to those positions we have encouraged so that the extended family can enjoy occasional holidays here. Their applications should be dealt with in a more flexible and user-friendly manner, whether by the Minister&rsquo;s Department or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the residency and equality Bill which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to bring forward later this year. There is an overlap between the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a regular basis and it would make sense if most of the responsibility fell to one Department. The Minister&rsquo;s Department is the appropriate one to deal with these issues because it has a knowledge of the employee, the employer, the background to the case and so on. It would lighten the load on officials making decisions in these cases if they could refer to the history of the case more quickly and make decisions which would be more in keeping with what the employee is trying to do and what the family is trying to achieve.</P>

	<P>The protection of migrant workers is an issue we cannot ignore. It was mentioned in the context of this Bill and I have received much correspondence from different unions in my constituency on the issue. I know <Col N="1672"/>various officials and inspectors deal with this issue but we constantly hear the argument that there is a need for more people to be involved in the labour inspectorate to deal with the rights of workers, the pay they receive and to ensure fair play all round.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I refer to students who come here to study. Once they complete their studies, they are asked to leave. In some cases, they are highly qualified. There is significant demand in the economy for graduates in certain disciplines and the Bill should provide flexibility so migrant graduates can remain in the State without having to go through the bureaucratic process again. The Minister should examine the issue because the economy would benefit and he should elaborate on it to increase understanding of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello referred to the integration of migrant workers and the need to ensure they become part and parcel of a multicultural society. My experience is contrary to the Deputy&rsquo;s. Perhaps we are more hospitable in Kilkenny but migrant workers have integrated well in the city. Those who are in the workforce are made to feel at home while those who are going through the asylum process are taking it on the chin and are also integrating. However, in both instances, the State would do itself a service if it reduced the bureaucracy involved and treated immigrants in the way other human beings are treated. I welcome the Bill.</P>

	<P>I thank all Members for their contributions to a constructive debate. I thank Deputy McGuinness for his remarks and, given that Deputy Hogan is also present, I can confirm the capacity of Kilkenny people to help outsiders to integrate in the city.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The integration issue is important. As transformation takes place and Ireland becomes a country of net immigration as opposed to emigration, a significant challenge is presented to put in place the infrastructure and mechanisms to ensure proper integration of migrant workers in our communities. My Department will shortly launch an initiative with F&Aacute;S on the integration of migrant employees in the workplace through the provision of language training and the dissemination of relevant materials to such workers. Broader initiatives will be taken by other Departments, for example, in the area of education, to ensure proper integration.</P><Col N="1673"/>
      <P>Many issues were raised by Members. The key issue is that the Bill represents another significant advance in economic migration policy. It provides a flexible framework, which will enable us to adapt and refine our policies going forward. It is buttressed by the economic migration policy document published by the expert skills groups, which examined a range of issues in this regard. The majority of low skill needs should be met by the EU labour market, which comprises more than 250 million people. Ireland is a regional market in a 25 member state economy and that reality must be recognised. This has an impact on attracting migrant labour from outside the EU. More than 100,000 people from outside the EU have worked in Ireland at some stage over the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>Our first priority is to upskill our workforce to enable people to avail of the increased opportunities that continue to be created through foreign direct investment and the growth of indigenous companies. We are working with F&Aacute;S and the education partners to ramp up qualifications and increase the overall skills of the population.</P>
      <P>Employees as well as employers can apply for work permits under the legislation. It will be vacancy driven but the system will not be based on quotas or points. There are advantages and disadvantages to quota systems while the disadvantages of the points systems outweigh the advantages. Quota systems can be inflexible and complex and questions arise regarding how quotas are determined, what are the optimum levels and so on while points systems are more transparent and predictable but they are also complex to design and administer.</P>
      <P>The green card system embraces the best aspects of the US green card system and other quotas and points systems without taking on their disadvantages. We have examined systems in different countries and we have embraced their best aspects. The proposed green card system will provide a pathway to citizenship and discussions in this regard were held with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform prior to the publication of the legislation. Last March the Government agreed the establishment on a non-statutory basis of a new naturalisation and immigration service in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to oversee a single admissions procedure for immigration. The service deals with the admission of non-nationals to the State, asylum applications, the management and processing of applications for legal residency, the naturalisation process and the enforcement elements of this programme. My Department has established a virtual link between its information systems and those of the immigration service. However, my Department will continue to be responsible for economic migration policy and the granting of work and green card permits. That synergy is ongoing and <Col N="1674"/>the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce legislative proposals regarding family reunification.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was published and the green card system was announced, the Government stated that once an individual was granted a green card permit, family reunification would be permitted. I understand the comments of Members in this respect because all of us have met non-nationals who have been in the State for two or three years without their families. That can be distressing and disturbing. The green card system will extend to a larger cohort of people. A similar provision applied under the work visa authorisation scheme, which dealt with a limited section of the migrant worker population. I have listened to the comments of Members and the green card system will provide for family reunification and a pathway to citizenship. The two-year provision also applies in the US. Nobody will have a <i>carte blanche</i> once he or she is granted a green card permit. If permit holders behave well, obey the laws of the State and so on, they can look forward to permanent residency and citizenship. It is important to distinguish between green card permits and work permits, which address temporary shortages in the labour market.</P>
      <P>The Bill also represents a significant advance in the protections for migrant workers. However, the Government is conscious of the need to be vigilant in the area of labour law compliance. We are open to significant engagement with the trade union movement and other social partners regarding the best modalities for labour law compliance and enforcement and to ensure migrant workers are not exploited. Recent events have caused us disquiet and I, therefore, sanctioned an increase in the number of labour inspectors to 31. All the posts should be filled by the end of the month with the additional inspectors concentrating on sectors in which many migrant workers are employed.</P>
      <P>With regard to future initiatives, the labour inspectorate prepared a discussion document on its mandate and resourcing. It was circulated to the social partners in January 2005 with the purpose of stimulating debate and signalling that fundamental changes in enforcement of employment rights compliance should be considered. The ultimate objective is the formulation of a set of recommendations for Government from various possibilities. One proposal is that a strategic programme of education and information dissemination regarding employment rights be undertaken from early next year. The intention is that general communications media be used to ensure delivery to the target audiences. It is intended that the programme would meet the demand to target messages to workers in specific sectors and address the challenge of informing people who do not speak English as an effective working language.</P><Col N="1675"/>
      <P>I have also stated that the Government is open to amendments on Committee Stage. We will listen carefully to the arguments advanced. In my initial speech I indicated that the Government will make amendments on Committee Stage. We will examine the case of students and whether it requires an amendment. The economic migration policy published by the expert skills group puts forward the view that students who have studied here at undergraduate and postgraduate level in our third level colleges should be allowed to remain in this country and make a contribution to economic life. They may have spent up to six years here and we should take the sensible approach and facilitate their contribution without their having to leave the country. Scotland has undertaken an initiative of this kind and I am keen to do something similar, subject to detailed examination. I hope to propose an amendment on Committee Stage if there is not the flexibility in the Bill to facilitate this. Deputy McGuinness raised this point and it is a measure to which I am favourably disposed.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contribution and look forward to an informed, constructive discussion on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose sharing time with Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Connolly. This is a mean-spirited and miserly Bill. It represents no great leap forward and does little to improve the situation of parents. It must be radically transformed if it is to grant parents a substantial increase in the amount of time they can devote to their children. The Green Party wants to see 26 weeks of maternity leave and an additional six months&rsquo; parental leave to be taken by either the mother or father. We want to see an onus on fathers to take paternity leave and we suggest an obligation <Col N="1676"/>on fathers to take a certain amount of parental leave in the first year of a child&rsquo;s life.</P>
      <P>The world has changed and while traditional models of parenting still work for many people, fathers should be obliged to spend time with their children, particularly in the first year. I speak both as a father and a Deputy. This proposal can only work if the State makes a strong commitment to parents and if Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats make a substantial increase in parental benefit. I do not see that arising from this Bill. I wait with bated breath, or perhaps jaundiced breath, for significant changes in the forthcoming budget but I do not see a significantly increased commitment to parenting in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We want to see a commitment by the State to parents and their children through substantially increased benefits. Concerning the first year of a child&rsquo;s life, it makes sense that the State allow a parent remain with the child full-time. I cannot see that happening in the context of this Bill. We should provide a strong cushion of support for new parents. It is a precious, important period and the State should protect, nourish and encourage parents to spend time with the child.</P>
      <P>There are other areas in which we wish to see change. The world has changed and the family based on marriage has changed. Most first-time births in the State are to women who are not married and the State must change to reflect this. Often the institutions of church and State change much more slowly than they should. Our birth rate has increased and parents find themselves in a bind owing to the high cost of child care and the lack of State benefits extended to families. The Bill does not go far enough to help parents and the State should provide a cushion of a year&rsquo;s benefit and full support for that crucial time in a child&rsquo;s life. The State should instruct fathers to spend time with newly born children during this precious time. We should try to remove some pressures so that mothers and fathers feel comfortable with a financial cushion to ensure the child has a good start.</P>
      <P>We often refer to the major importance of the early years. The first 12 months set up much for the child&rsquo;s journey through the world. We send signals to society through Bills such as this and the Oireachtas should send the signal that we will protect parents and children and allow them to spend time together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This is modest legislation and provides for some improvement in parental leave in accordance with the Sustaining Progress agreement. However, the Government should be embarrassed to debate this Bill in the Oireachtas at this time. It is long overdue and implements an agreement that has run out at this stage. This Bill is pathetic when demands are growing and debate is raging though the State on <Col N="1677"/>child care, the extent of need and the magnitude of response required from Government. We should be better employed debating a comprehensive Bill dealing with maternity, paternity and parental leave in the context of a range of legislative and fiscal measures to provide a comprehensive child care service. Instead, we are debating this Bill and we must await the impending budget to see what emerges from Government to meet the massive child care needs of the people of this State.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement yesterday that the Government cannot discriminate between parents providing full-time care in the home and parents who work and pay for child care. I hope the Taoiseach will follow the logic of that statement by ensuring the implementation of the necessary changes in the coming weeks and months. The basic principle is that we must put children first. Putting Children First is the name we chose for our pre-budget submission just over 12 months ago. It has been employed by others since then, but I suppose on the basis that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we welcome the Labour Party&rsquo;s recent contributions to this debate.</P>
      <P>Children and their needs must be at the centre of the child care debate and the first priority is the best care for all children. Parents who wish to provide that care in the home must be allowed do so without suffering the major drop in income that so many experience. Such a fall in income can be crippling and lead to real difficulties in people&rsquo;s daily lives. As things stand, a work-life balance for many families does not exist. Work and the needs of employers are the predominant factors which often prevent people who wish to do so from starting a family. Young couples delay having children because of the situation with the work-life balance. In addition, those conditions prevent people with young children from giving them the care and attention to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Many young couples now work long hours to service large mortgages, health insurance and many other costs facing those on average incomes who are starting out in life and endeavouring to provide a home of their own. This is before they even take into account the cost of providing for children.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating to have to address this Bill when it fails to provide the essential improvements in maternity and paternity leave. Currently, mothers are entitled to 18 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave and eight weeks&rsquo; unpaid leave. The key demand is for the Government to change the law to guarantee, as of right, 26 weeks&rsquo; paid maternity leave which, as I have pointed out on many occasions, is the situation north of the Border. The community I represent does not stop at the Border; it takes in a wide hinterland. Despite this, we have this serious differential and <Col N="1678"/>inequity in periods of maternity leave North and South. We must ensure that the same supports apply to mothers in this jurisdiction. That measure alone would provide vital relief to thousands of people, but if there is no such provision in the promised package of Government measures, that package will be fundamentally flawed. I hope and trust that this will not be the case and that we will see maternity leave harmonised on an all-Ireland, all-island basis in the Government&rsquo;s proposals.</P>
      <P>The Bill omits any reference to paternity leave. Public sector employees receive a minimal three days&rsquo; paternity leave, but no one has a statutory entitlement to it so people must rely on the goodwill of their employers. That is not acceptable. Many EU member states have legislated for paid paternity leave so that fathers can spend time with their newborn children. Paternity leave ranges from 18 days in Finland to two days in Greece. The absence of such a provision in this Bill represents another missed opportunity. We must await the promised package of measures to see how it will be addressed by the Government.</P>
      <P>I now wish to deal with parental leave, but first I note that the Minister is taking leave of us.</P>

	<P>We will live and see, please God. A MORI-MRC survey has shown that only 20% of eligible employees take up parental leave. The survey revealed that parents are not taking up such leave because they are not entitled to any payment. The introduction of paid parental leave would be a positive and progressive step, yet the Bill has failed to provide for such leave. While greater flexibility in how parental leave can be taken, as provided for in the Bill, is welcome, it should go further, and that should be done when a further opportunity presents itself. <Col N="1679"/>Perhaps that idea could be taken on board in advance of Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister and his colleagues to prepare Government amendments on Committee Stage to provide employees with a right to request more flexible parental leave arrangements and to oblige employers to consider such requests seriously. Refusal of such requests by employees should only be permitted where the employer can provide evidence of a compelling business case for a refusal. This reasonable proposal has been put forward by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I urge the Minister to provide for it on Committee Stage by way of Government amendment.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is modest, to say the least, the Government&rsquo;s response to the important points raised in the House, including the need for paid parental leave, will be an acid test of its commitment to child care. It will be an opportunity to adjudge all that was said at and following the Ballyconnell meeting, and whether it will translate in real terms.</P>

	<P>I hope that by the time the Bill comes back to the House on Report Stage, we will have a comprehensive package of measures before us. Over a year ago, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled a Private Members&rsquo; motion on child care that set out a range of essential measures. This was followed by a pre-budget submission which, as I have already indicated, was entitled Putting Children First. We are happy to have been central to the child care debate which has escalated over the past year. That is due in no small measure to the fact that the Minister for Finance failed to address this major need in his first Budget Statement. The National Economic and Social Forum published a landmark report which I have commended to the Taoiseach on several occasions. It sets out the benchmark the Government must reach. The Minister of State has <Col N="1680"/>already noted we are watching and waiting with interest. I hope he and his colleagues will take on board my points on this Stage of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004, when preparing their amendments for Committee Stage. This would facilitate a more focused and worthwhile Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The soldiers of destiny descended on Inchydoney, the Slieve Russell hotel, and lately, Killarney, looked into their hearts and souls &mdash; assuming that they have hearts and souls &mdash; laboured hard and brought forth this Bill. It has, however, taken a long time. The Bill arises from a commitment made following the 1998 report of the working group on the review and improvement of the Parental Leave Act. This was not even the last election but a year after the previous election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy does not want to be reminded of promises made before the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were flush with promises at the time and it was in their hearts to deliver everything in sight to the electorate before, during and after elections. The interval between 1998 and now marks a serious gap in the memory of the then newly elected Government in 1998 and its successor in 2002. Eventually, in 2005, it has been called ashore. Something must have happened in Inchydoney, the Slieve Russell or Killarney to convince the Government to do something about this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill also arises from commitments entered into in the Sustaining Progress &mdash; Social Partnership Agreement 2003-2005, two years ago. That includes a commitment by the Government to strengthen parental leave, with the agreed recommendations of the social partners. The June 2004 mid-term review of Sustaining Progress committed the Government to enacting this legislation before summer 2005.</P>
      <P>While there has been a seasonal change due to global warming and other factors, I am not sure the summer has shifted to the extent that it covers the introduction of this legislation to the House before winter 2005. There has been some slippage in the exuberance with which Government delivers on its promises. However, it surely has not slipped to the extent that the seasons have changed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is necessary because of changes in work practices and society. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, from my former constituency of Kildare, now serving Kildare South, is upset at this long delay. The legislation is being dragged into the House, having failed to come in before the summer, and is squeezed in at the eleventh hour before winter <Col N="1681"/>descends. It is a commitment of sorts, better late than never.</P>
      <P>Society has changed dramatically in recent years and will change even more. The Bill will hopefully recognise and strengthen the position of parents&rsquo; entitlements to time with their children, and <i>vice versa</i>. By the time parents have arranged for cr&egrave;ches, pre-schools and playschools, sat in traffic jams for two to four hours a day and paid their mortgage and childminding fees, they will have little time out. It is necessary to introduce legislation of this nature to regulate to some extent and provide the level of parental leave that must statutorily be made available.</P>
      <P>The proposal to raise the maximum age of the eligible child from five to eight years is progressive and useful. The Bill does not go far enough, however, in increasing the maximum age of a child with a disability to 16 years. There is an even greater need to extend parental leave to care for a child with special needs or a disability. In such situations the parent may save the State a considerable sum by devoting more time to his or her child. Many parents have heretofore devoted their lives to children with disabilities and saved the State the equivalent cost of caring for the child.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State might reconsider that section, with a view to introducing amendments to improve that area. One&rsquo;s heart goes out to a parent who cares for a child with special needs. There are many such parents, some of whom receive carer&rsquo;s allowance and many who, for various reasons, do not qualify for the allowance. If more improvements can be made in the degree to which parental leave can be made statutorily available to them it should be done in this Bill. It is unlikely this Bill will be revisited before the next election, particularly given the delay in bringing it forward this time.</P>
      <P>The provision to take the statutory entitlement of 14 weeks&rsquo; parental leave in separate blocks, of a minimum six continuous weeks, is progressive and necessary. The logistics are understandable and welcome, given the parent&rsquo;s need to make arrangements to take that leave. The provision whereby a parent who falls ill and cannot therefore care for the child during the parental leave period, may postpone or suspend the leave for the duration of the illness is also progressive and important. It recognises that a bureaucratic obstruction existed in the past such that parental leave was no great concession to the parent who fell ill during that period. This legislation proposes to address that issue and hopefully will do so in full.</P>
      <P>I hope the strengthened provision to protect the right to return to work is strictly enforced with no deviation countenanced in any circumstances. If the employee is entitled to parental leave, in respect of a child with or without special needs, the right to return to work must remain <Col N="1682"/>constant. It is necessary to ensure provision for this when there is a need to expand the workforce and a demand for more employees.</P>
      <P>The provision to protect employees who exercise the right to parental leave from penalisation is connected to the previous point. It goes without saying that once legislation is passed providing for a parent to take leave, no circumstances should be tolerated in which that person is penalised, whether in respect simply of the right to return to work, or to return to the work he or she did before taking the leave &mdash; a separate issue &mdash; or in any other way that affects his or her rights in the workplace. They are entitled to their rights in the same way as if they had never taken parental leave. No penalty should accrue or arise from the right of the person to take parental leave as provided for in the legislation, in whatever manner a person wants to take such leave.</P>
      <P>I am concerned for the large numbers of parents who are non-nationals now working in this country. Other speakers have also raised the issue. The legislation will provide for all persons in the workforce but from some of the things we have seen and heard, and some of the experiences we have had, it is not entirely clear that everyone respects the rights of non-nationals with regard to their entitlements while in and out of the workforce.</P>
      <P>That also applies to Departments. Apropos the previous Bill which passed through the House, Departments need to look at themselves in the way they dictate policy as it affects non-nationals. It is much more difficult for non-nationals in the parental leave area. If at any time there is a scarcity of employees in the workforce, the pressure is on to get as many people as possible in to work. That is understood. However, whatever else prevails, there must be no situation whereby a national or non-national is in any way discriminated against as a result of his or her entitlement to parental leave in this context. The situation whereby a person&rsquo;s entitlement to parental leave does not arise has arisen in the past and will no doubt arise again.</P>
      <P>Special attention needs to be paid to the particular situation as it affects non-nationals who are parents and have their families with them in Ireland. How are those non-national families affected who do not have all their children of relevant age with them in Ireland, the age group already referred to? I wonder if provision is being made in the legislation for such a situation. Such families come from all parts of the world. The emigration services report which I listened to this morning envisaged that in future we will receive more applications for work permits from those who wish to live and work in Ireland because of a number of factors, including our growing economy.</P>
      <P>The Government will attempt to take all the credit for the growth but I like to point out that <Col N="1683"/>we still have a long way to grow, and a lot of growing to do. We ceased to grow for a long time. Before the Government parties claim that the end of growth was the responsibility and fault of others, I point out that during almost 18 of the past 20 years, government of this State was in the hands of the parties opposite me, or some variation of them. There have been a number of variations. We will not go down that road because if needs be we can apply the odium equally when it comes to the degree to which we can claim credit for the current growth in the economy. We are grateful for that growth, but there is much more growing to be done and much more effort to be made.</P>
      <P>We should keep in mind the benefit to the economy of non-nationals coming to Ireland to work. We must give them the same rights and entitlements which the rest of our workforce has, none more so than with regard to this legislation. It comes late, like most things from the Government side, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows from experience, but better late than never. The legislation has fairly sweeping provisions of a beneficial nature, though improvements can be made in some areas. Despite the emphasis on the seasonal changes, only one season has slipped by with regard to the Government failure to deliver before summer 2005. Maybe the climate changes covers that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004. Child care and parental entitlements are a live issue. We saw the report in the<i> Irish Examiner</i> yesterday indicating the concern of people throughout the country about appropriate and adequate child care provisions which would allow some support for the long-suffering parent in the workplace in particular, but also for the long-suffering parent in the home who gets little consideration for the time and effort given on an unpaid basis in rearing children.</P>
      <P>An integral part of providing a service is to give rights, entitlements and leave to parents to provide a structure and an ethos whereby we have a parent-friendly workplace. It is amazing that it has taken us so long to even consider that people must rear and educate their children at the same time as they must work at a steady 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job, and that provisions have not been made. The only way we dealt with the issue in the past was by telling people in the public service and Civil Service that the spouse had to leave the workplace. That was a harsh, uncaring approach, but at least it had the benefit of recognising that children required a lot of caring, and that at least one parent needed to be with children all the time. That parent was of course the mother, and the legislation referred only to the <Col N="1684"/>mother. It was only mothers who had to give up their careers in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Though we have abolished that system, we have not come very far in providing an adequate response so that both parents can remain in the workplace and at the same time contribute meaningfully to the rearing of their children. I say meaningfully because it is not just in the interests of the parents to have reasonable conditions under which they can get time off or leave from work to be with their children. It is in the interests of the State. Good parenting makes for good citizenship. If children are neglected and do not have the warmth, bonding and attachment of their parents at an early stage, there is a danger of them becoming easily dysfunctional and of their ability to cope as good citizens being seriously weakened. The State has a strong role in this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation. It arises from an agreement under the Sustaining Progress social partnership pact 2003-05. I note that the mid-term review in 2004 committed the Government to having the legislation enacted before summer of this year. That deadline has clearly been missed. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who debated this Bill in the Seanad during the previous term, was confident that a deadline of last summer would be met. That was a number of months ago and, because the deadline was not met, we are attempting to bring the legislation through this House before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill have been well rehearsed in terms of the increase in the age of eligibility age from five to eight, or 16 in the case of children with disabilities, and the extension of parental leave to persons acting in <i>loco parentis,</i> relatives and separated people. The entitlement to take 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks of a minimum of six weeks each provides a better way to address this issue. Sick parents may postpone parental leave for the duration of their illness. The strengthened protections on the right to return to work are important, as are safeguards for employees who are parents against penalties arising from taking parental leave. It is easy for parents to be penalised upon their return to the workplace. The Bill also provides for a statutory code of practice on parental leave. These measures are all desirable.</P>
      <P>This legislation was negotiated under the Sustaining Progress social partnership of 2003 to 2005. It is a shame these entitlements, which do not present significant costs to the Exchequer, were not introduced earlier. While the negotiators might have believed that further entitlements would not be granted, the provisions as they stand are far from what is needed. I imagine that the next social partnership process &mdash; the establishment of which appears to be in rocky waters because of the Irish Ferries debacle &mdash; will seek many more concessions in the area of par<Col N="1685"/>ental entitlements and child care. The absence of paid parental leave is a critical issue and is often remarked upon. Parental leave has to be taken at one&rsquo;s own cost and does not entail genuine entitlements.</P>
      <P>This Bill amends the Parental Leave Act 1998, which in turn implemented the parental leave directive adopted in 1996. The provisions are an enhancement over previous legislation and give greater flexibility to parents or those who are in <i>loco parentis</i>. The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate working parents to spend more time with their children and to assist bonding amongst them. It is extremely important from that point of view. It is also more parent centred. The original Act was employer centred.</P>
      <P>The Bill strengthens protections on the right to return to work. A parent is now entitled to return to the same job and control of employment on terms no less favourable than when he or she left work. These conditions apply equally to maternity and adoptive leave. Clearly, a parent who bears the responsibility of bearing and raising children and supporting them financially should not be penalised by dismissal, unfair treatment or unfavourable changes in conditions of employment for exercising the entitlement to parental leave.</P>
      <P>Policing of the legislation under the statutory code of practice prepared by The Equality Authority is probably the most welcome provision. I fear a situation where somebody who takes full parental leave is made subject to a diminution of entitlements upon his or her return to work. It is important that people do not suffer in that way.</P>
      <P>A glaring omission in terms of this legislation is the absence of provision for paid parental leave. This issue arose when the 1998 legislation was debated. I do not know whether progress has been made on this issue, although I am sure the Minister of State has words of wisdom for us on the negotiations he has conducted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in the backrooms of the Civil Service in terms of what compromises he is prepared to make and how these will relate to the forthcoming budgetary considerations. Given that it was decided in 2004 that this legislation would be enacted by last summer, the Minister of State should have taken a leaf from the book of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform because he is a great man for introducing legislation. He leaves Bills hanging around so that they come to resemble snowballs in terms of amassing amendments and, by the time they are enacted, have become entirely different legislation. Such an approach is sometimes good and, more often, bad because the Minister is inclined to include the kitchen sink.</P><Col N="1686"/>
      <P>There is an opportunity to consider a modest gesture to parents by bringing an amendment that would provide for at least a modicum of paid parental leave. It is not too late to do so because amendments may be considered even on Report Stage. The difficulty for the Opposition in tabling amendments in this respect is that any amendment we put forward will be ruled out of order on financial grounds. Therefore, such an amendment will have to come from the Government. The best we can do is to record on Second Stage the unanimity among the serried ranks of the Opposition with regard to parental leave measures. We would not set a precedent by introducing such measures because many other countries have already legislated for similar provisions. The best practice in other European countries should be made available to our citizens. Now is the time to make such a provision because it is impossible for any Minister to claim at present that we cannot afford to do so.</P>
      <P>Much of our current legislative discussions concern the workplace, such as our debate on the Employment Permits Bill. The economy is booming and, because there are insufficient Irish workers to satisfy the demand for labour, we need migrant workers from the EU and elsewhere. In trying to attract highly skilled individuals by means of the permits legislation, a somewhat undesirable two-tier system is being developed. Highly skilled workers who earn more than &euro;60,000 will be fast-tracked to residency and citizenship entitlements after two years, if we can believe the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; who is encroaching on this territory &mdash; claims that the relevant measures will be introduced shortly. Less skilled immigrants who expect to have earnings of around &euro;30,000 will have fewer entitlements. There will also be an unskilled pool of labour. Much work remains to bring order to this issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of parental leave, we are a booming economy with wealth levels second only to Luxembourg and that should be reflected in the services we provide to our citizens.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Too often the workplace is dealt with in terms of units of production and of labour. We are attracting women back into the workplace to fill the labour gap, not as part of a career or as something that is beneficial in terms of the whole person. We have attracted large numbers of women back into the work force &mdash; although often they do not have very much choice because of the cost of mortgages and cr&egrave;che facilities &mdash; but we are now penalising women in every sense and the family is being heavily penalised by the manner in which we have done so.</P>
      <P>It is time to look at the broader issue of the quality of society rather than just the quantity of work and number of workers. Every day in the <Col N="1687"/>D&aacute;il the Taoiseach asserts that there are now 2 million workers here, which is 500,000 more than we had in the mid-1990s. That is true but we also have greater gross national product and gross domestic product and are in a better position to provide the services that should be provided.</P>
      <P>Paid parental leave would be a very valuable support for those on low incomes. Such people cannot afford to take unpaid parental leave. That is the problem with this Bill. It is a bit like the Ritz, in that it is open to everybody but if one is not able to afford it, then one will not get past the door or, if one gets past the door, one will not get to sample its delights. The benefits of unpaid parental leave are more accessible to those who are well-off, particularly if there is one strong earner in the household. This, in turn, raises another issue, in that it will almost always be the female who will have to leave the work force because, in general terms, female remuneration lags considerably behind male remuneration.</P>
      <P>It will be more difficult for people with low skills from disadvantaged communities to avail of the statutory entitlement. It will also be more difficult for women if the entitlement, as proposed, remains because they are likely to be the lower earner in the household. It will always be the lower earner who is expected to take the unpaid parental leave so that sufficient money will still come in to pay the exorbitant costs of running a household.</P>
      <P>What of lone parents? How can a lone parent take unpaid parental leave? Let us address that issue. If one is a lone parent, raising one or more children, what does one do? Does one take unpaid parental leave? The only thing one can do is give up one&rsquo;s job. If one takes unpaid parental leave, one has no income. Even if a concession was made in that regard, there are instances in which certain categories of workers will obtain the entitlement to unpaid leave but will not be able to avail of it under any circumstances. Consideration must be given to this issue. Unpaid parental leave is a right that the rich, or the reasonably well-off, will be able to avail of but which will be beyond the reach of the poor.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the fact that it will be women rather than men who will be forced, through economic circumstances, to avail of parental leave. This compounds the gender discrimination that already exists in our society. Unpaid parental leave will always result in such discrimination. More fathers would be able to take parental leave if it was available without loss of income to the household.</P>
      <P>The concept of parental leave is fabulous but the implementation leaves so much to be desired that it will not work in practice in any fair manner. Some people will be quite happy with the entitlement. Those who have formidable incomes will have no problem. They will be delighted to <Col N="1688"/>be able to take leave and return to the workplace when it suits them, with no diminution of rights, and their households will do fine because their income is good and steady. However, the vast majority of people are being given a right without the resources to implement that right. Not only are we not giving them the resources to implement it, we are providing the right in a way that will constitute discrimination. It will discriminate against women in the workplace, lone parents and certain categories of workers who will never be able to avail of that right.</P>
      <P>While there are financial considerations and implications for paid parental leave, there are few for unpaid parental leave, certainly with regard to the Exchequer, whatever about individual employers who may have to find substitute staff and so forth. Given that fact, would it not be possible to increase the length of time during which unpaid parental leave is available? The Bill provides for 14 weeks parental leave in separate blocks of a minimum of six weeks. Is there any reason unpaid parental leave should not extend to six or 12 months?</P>
      <P>We have only just begun to tease out the concept of parental leave and the problems that arise. Parental leave must become a major part of the provision of child care. It is an important part of child care in that it allows for parental contact with children at an early stage of their development, permitting the bonding process to take place. Should it not be a more structured and larger part of the overall child care package?</P>
      <P>Parental leave should be given a structure and framework. It does not have a real framework at present and to have one, it would have to tie in with the provision of continuous child care that would cover the critical years from age one to four. Such child care would have different dimensions but parental leave should be tailored in this legislation in a way that will allow it to dovetail into other provisions, namely maternity leave, parental leave, paid parental leave, career breaks, unpaid parental leave and various provisions regarding cr&egrave;ches and pre-school facilities. I would like to see this issue dealt with in that context, as a package that would benefit parents in the home and in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill. The legislation is very important and this debate provides us with an opportunity to deal with the issue of parents and parental leave. It also gives us an opportunity to examine in detail the role of parents in society, particularly this modern society. We have regular debates in this House and in the wider political field on the role and the value of the family, often comparing the modern family to that of the past. It is important, while discussing this legislation, to examine the role of parents and the family.</P><Col N="1689"/>
      <P>When one examines research and the reality for most people in our communities, it is clear that a strong and healthy family will lead to a strong and healthy society. We have seen the downside of dysfunctional families, and the problems this causes children, parents and the wider society, particularly as a result of alcohol or drug addiction. It is important to deal with these issues when debating the Bill.</P>
      <P>In modern Ireland there are a number of different types of families. The family unit must be respected, regardless of its make-up. While people inside and outside the House may disagree with me on this issue, the definition of the family and the changing society are issues that must be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I was to raise the role of single parents because there is a negative image in broader society, particularly in sections of the media, of single parents and their contribution to society. However, I find the opposite is the reality. One should examine the positive contribution single parents make to the economy, the workforce and communities. This goes back to my previous job in a north inner city school where the backbone of my parents council and board of management was single parents who made a massive contribution to the school and their blocks of flats. They dealt with the drugs issue and were very involved in youth groups and community groups. These positive images must be considered. We must challenge the prejudice and negative image that exists of single parents.</P>
      <P>Another issue that must be dealt with is that of adoptive parents. I thank and commend these people for their huge contribution to Irish society and the community as a whole. I know from direct family experience, and also from friends of mine who are adoptive parents, that the work they do and the strong healthy families in which they bring up their children make a major contribution to society. We have an opportunity here today to thank adoptive parents for their valuable work and commend them on it.</P>
      <P>Another related issue is the role of foster parents. These are fantastic and brave people who help children. They take them from dysfunctional and violent situations where they suffer severe neglect and bring them into their homes. I call them the patriots of Ireland in 2005 who do their bit for their country and society. I commend them on and thank them for their significant contribution to society.</P>
      <P>Another issue which is covered in the legislation relates to families of children with disabilities and their significant contribution to society. Gone are the days when children with disabilities, particularly intellectual disabilities, were locked away and it was frowned upon to have a mentally handicapped son or daughter. Thankfully, those days are over and people are beginning to respect the rights of children and <Col N="1690"/>adults with disabilities. As legislators, we must provide them with maximum support and services. I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the families of children with disabilities and thank them for their great work in this area and with the voluntary organisations which are the backbone of the community.</P>
      <P>In last year&rsquo;s budget, significant investment was made in services for people with intellectual disabilities and I commended the Minister on this extraordinary contribution to the development of these services. The Government listened to the voices of parents and families of people with disabilities, especially children with disabilities. We need to continue this work over a five or six-year period to ensure that all these people are given these services as of right.</P>
      <P>During the week I met an important group of people, namely, the carers in society. I commend the carers&rsquo; association for its magnificent work. There are 150,000 carers in the country who should be supported in the budget. They should also be supported under this legislation. If one examines the statistics, it is obvious that carers have made a huge economic contribution to society. Last year alone, the great human and kind work they did with the elderly, those with intellectual or physical disabilities and people who suffered strokes saved the Exchequer approximately &euro;1.5 billion. Despite this, they were given just &euro;250 million in last year&rsquo;s budget. I ask the Minister to listen to groups such as the carers&rsquo; association and to ensure they are given back-up and support services.</P>
      <P>When debating the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004, it is important to examine the changing role of women in society. Over the past five or six years, women have made a massive contribution to this economy. This country would not be able to function efficiently if tens of thousands of women were not involved directly in employment. We must support these people and realise that they make an economic as well as a significant tax contribution. This is an issue which must be taken into consideration. Given the changing role of women in society, the upcoming budget must target issues such as child care, disabilities and carers.</P>
      <P>We must accept that the debate on the economy and its efficiency is over and that it must focus on how we distribute wealth and resources. This is the real issue and the Minister for Finance will have a perfect opportunity in December to do something about it.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the legislation are as follows. It proposes increasing the maximum age for eligible children from five to eight years. The maximum age for children with disabilities has been increased to 16. There is also the extension of parental leave entitlements to persons acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in respect of eligible children. The Bill provides a statutory entitlement to take 14 <Col N="1691"/>weeks&rsquo; parental leave in separate blocks of a minimum of six continuous weeks. An employee who falls ill and is unable to care for a child may postpone or suspend the parental leave for the duration of the illness, which is a positive aspect. The legislation strengthens the provisions protecting the right to return to work, which is important for the economy, society and the community. It provides that employees who exercise their right to parental leave are protected from penalisation, which is important. Many people want to be involved directly with their families but they also want to make a contribution to their company and society.</P>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the entitlement to parental leave. It implements three recommendations of the working group by providing for an increase in the maximum age limit of an eligible child from five years to eight, making a new provision to increase the age limit to 16 years in the case of a child with a disability and providing for the extension of the parental leave entitlement to persons <i>in loco parentis</i> and to adopting parents of an eligible child. New definitions are provided in this section including &ldquo;adopting parent&rdquo;, &ldquo;disability&rdquo; and &ldquo;relevant parent&rdquo;. The emphasis is important for adoptive parents and parents of children with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides for the protection of employees from penalisation by way of dismissal, unfair treatment or unfavourable change in conditions of employment for proposing to exercise or having exercised an entitlement to parental leave. It is important to recognise that there are problems in families and society. One of the one frequent issues backbench Deputies are asked to deal with is anti-social behaviour. This is not just a policing issue but a parents issue. Where there are strong, healthy, vibrant, stable families there is less anti-social behaviour. I know this from direct experience. I have worked in the poorest parts of north inner city Dublin for 20 years and have seen people live in areas riddled with drugs and heroin, yet their children were able to attend school in their uniforms, to be clean, against the odds, and to have their homework done. That happened because they had a strong stable family unit in the middle of all this negativity.</P>
      <P>I would like to see research done on such good examples of families assisting children and to see this whole area explored by those who deal with problems in society, especially those who deal with social and family affairs issues. This is relevant to the debate. We must examine how some parents can do it against the odds and we must ensure those people are rewarded. There are many skilled young people in disadvantaged areas of the State who never get into trouble and make a fantastic contribution to the society. There can be in the region of 80% of such people in most communities.</P><Col N="1692"/>
      <P>We must reach out to those families, support them and not turn our back on them. While we may be coming late to the issue of parental leave and the broader debate, this is the opportunity to assist those people. The way to do it is to assist those families most in need and set the agenda which must include the weaker sections of society. Some 25% to 30% of people in parts of the State are excluded. Much is said in the House about social inclusion but let us do something about it.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a constructive proposal. There are a number of projects in the Departments of the Taoiseach, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs through which resources could be targeted at the most needy areas and streets. In parts of my constituency there are housing estates where, compared with average stable middle class homes, 52% of the children before the age of four are not eligible to start primary school. That issue will have to be examined.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to think about the family unit, pre-school services, language development, literacy and providing support to assist in creating a stable child. This would save a great deal of money in future and would create vibrant young people who have would have a vision and a belief in their country. We have learned from experience that people who work hard and come through the system against the odds are the people who will never turn their back on and will be supportive of their community. The Bill is not just about parental leave but the broader issue of the family, parents and the way children are treated in society. That is an important issue and it should be taken on board. I urge the Minister of State to take account of these issues in the run-up to the budget in the next few weeks. Parental leave, families and children are important.</P>
      <P>I note from the details of the financial implications that no significant costs are anticipated in connection with the legislation either in its administration or compliance with its terms by employers and employees. There will be some cost implications for employers arising from the broadening of the parental leave entitlement to employees <i>in loco parentis</i> if replacement staff are required to cover staff absences. This is an issue that must be faced to ensure the stability of jobs. We must understand small business people who are under pressure and who need consistent staff to assist them in running their companies. We will have to be flexible in that area also. However, as parental leave is unpaid this cost will not be significant.</P>
      <P>There will be benefits for employers and industry to the extent that the legislation will facilitate the increased participation and retention of women in the labour force. The focus of the Bill is to ensure we retain people who want to work <Col N="1693"/>and make a contribution to society. When speaking about women in the labour force, we must remember there are many who are not given the opportunity to develop their skills and leadership qualities within companies or the public service. It is sad that many talented people are being lost.</P>
      <P>There is also the role of men in society. Men have changed in Ireland during the past 20 years and, despite negative comments from some quarters, have made a massive contribution to child care and rearing families. They have become directly involved in their families. Frequently I meet young couples and young parents. Their voices should be heard on this issue. Nowadays both parents are involved and both are directly involved in the child care issues. It is important to get the balance right and that both parents are involved in the rearing of the child. If one is serious about the equality agenda, we must ensure both parents are allowed to develop their economic abilities and skills, whether in a private company or in the public service.</P>
      <P>This debate on the Bill is about creating strong and healthy families and creating a better and healthy society. If there are quality families and good supports, we have a healthy society, a better economy and a stronger community with sound values and a vision for the future. I commend adoptive parents, foster parents and families with children with disabilities on their massive contribution to society and the country as a whole. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, who is away on Government business and was detained. On his behalf I thank Deputies from all sides of the House who contributed to an interesting and wide-ranging debate not alone on the Bill but also on child care. These issues are inextricably linked. The Government is acutely aware of the time and cost pressures on working parents. This Bill is before the House during a time of wide public debate on child care and I am confident that, in his budget next month, the Minister for Finance will respond by announcing new initiatives in this area. I will return to the issue of child care.</P>
      <P>Deputies English and Morgan commented on the delay in enacting this legislation. As Deputies are aware, the Bill meets a commitment in the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement and I am hopeful that the Bill will be enacted in this session and before the expiry of Sustaining Progress at the end of the year. In the past 18 months alone, this Government achieved the enactment of four other pieces of equality related legislation, the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, the Equality Act 2004, the Disability Act <Col N="1694"/>2005 and the Adoptive Leave 2005. In this context, cries of delay from the Opposition benches ring hollow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>For years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Several Deputies have called for the introduction of paid parental leave which the Bill does not provide for. Those of us who are parents would be instinctively inclined towards maximising the amount of parental leave available and having it paid at the highest possible rate. In reality, a balance must be struck when enhancing employment rights which have a consequent impact on the cost of labour, productivity and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The issue of payment was debated in depth in the partnership process but a consensus could not be reached on paid parental leave. The working group report outlined a number of payment options and costed some of these for the Exchequer. Extrapolating one of these options to the present day gives a rough estimate of cost to the Exchequer of somewhere in the region of &euro;200 million per annum. This estimate is based on the qualifying criteria for the maternity benefit scheme, with an equivalent payment, and takes into account both the cost to the social insurance fund and public sector employer costs.</P>
      <P>I should also caution that this estimate assumes a high uptake of parental leave by women and a much lower uptake rate for men on the basis that, even in other countries where a social welfare type payment is available, men generally do not take parental leave in great numbers.</P>
      <P>Deputy English suggested raising the upper age limit of an eligible child to 12 or to the age a child leaves primary school. The directive stipulates an upper age of eight and the Bill matches this, except in the case of children with disabilities where the limit is 16. The upper limit of eight years was sought by ICTU and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, and the Government and employers agreed this in the course of negotiations for Sustaining Progress. In the Civil Service, the State as an employer has already implemented the higher age limit of eight after discussions with the unions rather than awaiting the enactment of the Bill. This was done incrementally. Initially the upper age limit was raised to six and perhaps this is the origin of Deputy English&rsquo;s question on age limits.</P>
      <P>In response to further points made by Deputy English, I confirm that both parents are already entitled to parental leave under the Parental Leave Act 1998, which is entirely unambiguous on this entitlement. All employees who have eligible children qualify for 14 weeks parental leave in their own right. The information material published by the Equality Authority, for example, is crystal clear on this. Information and promotional <Col N="1695"/>material produced by unions and employer groups also make this clear.</P>
      <P>On a related awareness point, the Parental Leave Act contains strong provisions protecting the jobs and employment conditions of employees who take parental leave. Again, a wealth of information is available to employees about this matter and the Equality Authority periodically promotes awareness through publicity and events like the annual national work-life balance day. The working group which reviewed the 1998 Act commissioned an attitudinal survey on parental leave entitlements which found that employee awareness was high at close to 90% of those surveyed. Further details on this survey are included in the 2002 report of the working group which is available on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform website and in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies asked about the absence of a statutory entitlement to paternity leave. In the public sector, employers provide three days paid paternity leave to civil servants, teachers, health service workers, garda&iacute;, prison officers and members of the Defence Forces. While also under no statutory obligation to do so, many private sector employers provide a short period of paternity leave without deducting pay.</P>
      <P>In the course of their deliberations on paternity leave, the cost implications for employers, both in terms of the absence of the father from the workplace and the monetary cost arising in the event of such leave being paid by employers, were considered by the review group. Concern was expressed over the adoption of any new measure which would result in increased costs for employers in view of the economic climate at that time and the need to maintain international competitiveness. It was counter argued that fathers should have a legal right to paternity leave and that such leave should attract payment. A statutory arrangement to allow for a father&rsquo;s entitlement to leave around the time of childbirth would enhance arrangements for the reconciliation of work and family life. However, in the absence of agreement with the social partners on the issue of paternity leave, the Bill makes no provision for an entitlement to paternity leave paid or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The option open to employers to postpone parental leave was questioned by Deputy Healy. The legislation would be unworkable if an employee could unilaterally decide when to take parental leave without having to pay any regard to the needs of the workplace. The provisions of section 11 of the Act are balanced however, in that the employer can exercise the option to postpone parental leave only for objective operational reasons or in the event of a crisis in the workplace and following consultation with the employee. Furthermore the employer has only a narrow <Col N="1696"/>timeframe within which he must act to seek to postpone the leave.</P>
      <P>Deputies Lynch and Morgan called for employees to have the right to request more flexibility in the manner parental leave might be taken. Many employees are already able to avail of their parental leave entitlement in a &ldquo;broken&rdquo; format such as blocks of weeks, days or hours as a result of reaching agreement with their employer. The 1998 Act provides for this in section 7. I would expect that issues like this pertaining to the detailed application of the provisions of the Act will be addressed in the context of the development of a statutory code of practice as provided for in section 10.</P>
      <P>I refute some Deputies&rsquo; comments that the Government&rsquo;s policy on children and child care lacks coherence. Ireland is one of the few countries in the world with a ten-year plan to improve the lives of all children. The national children&rsquo;s strategy which dates from 2000 is rooted in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is an interdepartmental response to improving children&rsquo;s lives and was developed with the expert assistance of NGOs and academics. The National Children&rsquo;s Office is a Government agency, established to support the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to drive implementation of the strategy and to ensure better co-ordination of services for children.</P>
      <P>An essential element of this Government&rsquo;s policy on children is the equal opportunities childcare programme. One of the key findings of a recent survey conducted by the ESRI for the forum on the workplace for the future is that access to affordable, good quality child care and family-friendly work practices is now a critical aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s labour force management capability. The Government is committed to fulfilling its responsibilities towards meeting this challenge. This includes increasing the supply of quality child care available to parents and to do so in a way that gives them the greatest choice. When we first came into office, there was a serious shortage of such places. We set ourselves the task of addressing the matter, through the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>The programme is substantial and its scale demonstrates that this is the first Government to recognise the need for the State to act in this area in a meaningful way. Centre-based child care is just one part of the equation and the Government supports parental choice, the choice to use centre-based child care, childminding, part-time child care, or child care by family members. This has been facilitated by increasing the levels of income support for all parents, regardless of the care choices they make for their children, through record increases in child benefit.</P><Col N="1697"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.8- ?>
      <P>Working parents are well supported through our taxation and child benefit system. This is borne out by the findings of a recently published OECD report, Taxing Wages 2003/2004, which found that the taxation rate of Irish workers is one of the lowest in OECD countries. The report, which looks at personal income tax and social security contributions in OECD countries in 2004, found that of the 30 countries surveyed, a married one-earner couple with two children in Ireland received more money in cash transfers from the State than they paid out in income tax and social security contributions. I understand that only Luxembourg is in the same league as Ireland in this respect. The Government is now actively considering a range of options to make further improvements to assist parents to manage their work and family commitments. I am confident the upcoming budget will contain several initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>Another conclusion from the recent ESRI survey for the forum on the workplace of the future was that:</P>
      <P LI="1">Work/life balance arrangements in the workplace and parental leave arrangements are an important aspect of choice in relation to caring for children. More workplaces need to implement flexible arrangements and develop a supporting management culture that ensures that those who avail of these arrangements are not disadvantaged in terms of their career advancement prospects.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Government is committed to playing a full role in helping employees to balance their work and family responsibilities and I urge all employers to play their part as well. Statutory provision is just one part of the equation. Employers too must take some share of the responsibility for ensuring that working parents can better reconcile the pressures of family and work commitments. Flexibility in working arrangements is the key. Many of our most successful enterprises have thrived in fiercely competitive markets while simultaneously affording generous flexibility to their employees in how they manage their work commitments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan proposes the European social model as the way forward while several other Deputies mock partnership as catering solely for the needs of business. These arguments fly in the face of reality. The economy has been transformed to one with an enviable fiscal position, close to full employment, rising living standards and low personal taxation. This is due in large part to this Government&rsquo;s rejection of the European social model which is characterised by stifling high taxation. Partnership has also played no small part in our economic success through a process of dialogue, consensus and compromise. The Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill has emerged <Col N="1698"/>from this process and should be viewed as a step forward acceptable to both sides of industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, looks forward to more detailed analysis of the Bill on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.</P><Col N="1699"/>
        <P>Immigration has become a highly sensitive and divisive issue in the United States since the tragic events of 11 September 2001. As a result, the position of our undocumented citizens in the US has become progressively more difficult. The quality of daily life for those affected has worsened with constant stress and anxiety as well as sadness at the inability of the undocumented to return temporarily to Ireland in the event of bereavement or serious illness of a relative or for other family occasions such as weddings.</P>
        <P>As the House is aware, the issue of the undocumented and the difficulties they face are matters of the highest priority for the Government. In all our contacts with political leaders of the United States, including when the Taoiseach and I met President Bush earlier in the year, we have emphasised the importance of addressing this issue in a positive and sympathetic way.</P>
        <P>On my visit to New York and Boston last week, I again stressed the high priority the Government attaches to the issue and to resolving it as soon as possible. To intensify our efforts further, which includes intensive ongoing lobbying by our ambassador and the embassy, I will visit Washington later this month for a series of meetings where I will once more strongly underline the priority which the Government attaches to securing the desired reforms.</P>
        <P>I also express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the all-party support for the Government&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the undocumented. Many Members of the Oireachtas, including the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Kenny, have given generously of their time to this important issue. The consensus in the Oireachtas was clearly demonstrated by the contribution of colleagues in both Houses during the debate on the all-party motions last month. I have conveyed these motions to the United States administration and to key players on Capitol Hill, including to Senators Kennedy and McCain.</P>
        <P>The legislative debate in Washington DC is entering a critical phase with various proposals under consideration, including the Bill jointly sponsored by Senators McCain and Kennedy. If this Bill were adopted in its present form, it would provide a path to permanent residency and, as a result, enable the undocumented to participate in the life of their adopted country free from fear and uncertainty. The Government strongly supports this Bill and I have instructed the embassy and consulates to intensify their lobbying in support of it.</P>
        <P>In addition to my commitment to try to advance the interests of the undocumented through legislative reform, I recently announced grants to Irish immigration centres in the US totalling $815,000. This represented an increase of 40% on last year. Any Irish person in the US in <Col N="1700"/>need of guidance and support at this complex time of change should approach one of these excellent centres. They provide a range of invaluable information and advisory services, and we warmly appreciate their work. While in New York last week, I again had the opportunity to see their work at first hand and to convey our deep appreciation for it, as I know many Deputies on all sides have also done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>My party is vigorous in its approach to the Bills before the Senate and the House of Representatives at present. The Minister referred to Deputy Kenny who was lobbying strongly in the United States last weekend. Deputy Connaughton led a group of Fine Gael Deputies to the United States earlier this year. We believe up to 50,000 undocumented Irish fear being involved in a minor breach of the law, consequently being sent home and branded as criminals. This fear should not exist. Does the Minister agree these people have contributed enormously to the economy of the United States and should be recognised for this?</P>
        <P>Having had discussions with the authorities in the United States, is the Minister optimistic the Kennedy-McCain and Colby Bills will pass the judicial committee, the House of Representatives and the Senate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the work Deputy Allen&rsquo;s party and all parties have done on this. The Kennedy-McCain Bills are on one side of the spectrum and other proposals exist on the other side of the spectrum, which are very restrictive. In recent times the United States administration has made suggestions on how this matter might be addressed. President Bush has not commented specifically on this other than to state that if increased enforcement is introduced, the large number of undocumented workers must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>The undocumented Irish may account for between 25,000 and 50,000 of a total of approximately 11 million affected, and this includes many nationalities. Suggestions from the administration have not included past permanent residency and I fear that unless some concession is made on the issue of permanent residency, the undocumented people will not come forward. They will fear that if they are granted a temporary six-year visa, the authorities will know where they are when the visa expires. We are not dictating to the authorities of the United States but we must articulate the views of our people. Unless this matter is dealt with in a way that encourages people to come forward willingly, it will not be a success.</P>
        <P>I have asked the embassy and consulate in the United States to give this top priority over the next few months. There is a window of opportunity, particularly in the new year, and after that <Col N="1701"/>the United States will be in election mode. At that stage, this matter will not be dealt with in a rational manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has the full support of the Independent Deputies. Does he have the figure for undocumented Irish in the United States? Today we heard a reference to 50,000 but I have heard figures as high as 80,000 to 100,000 and as low as 15,000 to 20,000. Does the Minister find it unacceptable that Irish citizens in the United States cannot travel home for family events such as weddings, funerals and Christmas? This causes extreme hardship to many families in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister accept that these people make a major contribution to the economy and society of the United States? We have a cross-party obligation to support them. I commend the politicians in the United States who support this legislation and I urge the Minister to continue to lobby. Any assistance that can be given to the immigration centres should be supported.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister find it strange to fight for the rights of our undocumented citizens in the United States when immigrants are being hounded out of this country? Does he feel uncomfortable about this?</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister to be more proactive in dealing with the undocumented Irish in the United States, particularly in defending their rights and protecting Irish citizens abroad. This is a very important issue. Recently the Minister was active in the case of Mr. Rory Carroll.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Defending the rights of Irish citizens abroad is part of the remit of my Department. There is nothing more I can do to defend the rights of undocumented Irish in the United States. I have been in the United States six times in the past nine months, albeit on other business on some occasions but I raised the issue of the undocumented Irish every time. Last week, I had a meeting with former President Bill Clinton on overseas development aid issues and the role of the Clinton Foundation. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is undertaking such work with the former US President in Mozambique. I raised the issue of undocumented Irish people in America with Mr. Clinton and received an undertaking that he would use his influence in whatever way he could in this regard.</P>
        <P>On one of my previous visits to America I met a person who had obtained a green card and works with a computer company in an immigration centre in Boston. He suggested we should create a database of Irish people who find them<Col N="1702"/>selves in this situation. I suggested in turn that we would provide funding for the compilation of such a database. Most of the immigration centres said it was not feasible, however, because people would not come forward fearing they might be pinpointed in future. I accept that argument. The figure for undocumented Irish people in America is somewhere in the region of 25,000 to 50,000 at the outer limit. The US Administration says it is approximately 5,000 but we believe there are 5,000 alone in a city such as San Francisco.</P>
        <P>This issue runs across party lines in the Oireachtas and involves all Members, including Independent Deputies. In our constituency offices we come across families who say their sons or daughters cannot come home for an important life event.</P>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>That causes grave concern. I accept that such people contribute greatly to the US economy, as undocumented people generally do. Those who argue against the Kennedy-McCain measure, suggest that the 11 million undocumented people must return whence they came in order to apply for legal resident status. That is a totally impractical suggestion, however, because the US economy could not deal with it. Proposals that do not include a path to legal residency are delaying the problem for another three to six years, at which point it will have to be dealt with again.</P>

        <Quest>if the Government accepts that its obligations under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires it to establish by way of verification, and beyond simple assurance, that persons are not being conveyed through Irish airports with the likelihood or risk that they are being conveyed for the purpose of such interrogation techniques as are in breach of such European conventions.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33557/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Torture is among the most abhorrent violations of human rights. It undermines the inherent dignity of the person and is, therefore, unacceptable and unjustifiable. Ireland, through a range of legal and policy measures, has signalled its recognition that freedom from torture is a right which must be protected and promoted.</P>
        <P>Among the conventions to which Ireland is a party are the European Convention on Human <Col N="1703"/>Rights and the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Government is extremely conscious of Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, including Article 3 thereof, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</P>
        <P>The European Court of Human Rights has held that Article 3 imposes a positive obligation on states to prevent torture. A state is obliged under the convention to take measures when it knows that there are substantial grounds for believing that a person faces a real risk of being subjected to torture. The Government is satisfied that this is not the situation in the use of Irish airports by the US authorities.</P>
        <P>On several occasions, the Government has made clear to the US authorities that it would be illegal to transit prisoners for rendition purposes through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities, acting in accordance with Irish and international law. The US authorities, for their part, have confirmed time and again that they have not done so and that they would not do so without seeking the permission of the Irish authorities. No request for such authorisation has been received from the US authorities to date.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to follow the long-standing practice whereby details supplied to the Department of Foreign Affairs in this area by the US authorities are accepted in good faith as being accurate.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated in the House that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would conduct a full investigation of any case where a credible claim of criminal activity has been made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Since I first tabled this question, circumstances have changed. As recently as today, the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper carried details of last year&rsquo;s report of the CIA&rsquo;s inspector general. That report suggests that interrogation techniques authorised by the Bush presidency breach commitments given under the UN Convention against Torture. The Minister should regard that as a matter of concern.</P>
        <P>Various international sources have verified that a plane, on lease to the US State Department and the CIA, has landed in Shannon on up to 80 occasions. The Minister has relied on assurances from the United States of America, but the UN Committee against Torture regards a simple assurance as insufficient. In the case of Sweden, admittedly, the circumstances were different because an individual was apprehended and removed, but a simple assurance was insufficient.</P><Col N="1704"/>
        <P>A debate is currently taking place in the Danish Parliament arising from the fact that the government there has refused permission to use Danish airspace to the same plane that is landing in Shannon. Despite that prohibition, however, the plane has continued to land in Denmark.</P>
        <P>Would the Minister agree that compliance with the two European conventions and the UN Convention against Torture requires random or regular checks to be made on planes that are possibly being used for what is called &ldquo;extraordinary rendition&rdquo;? This is a serious matter and the ECHR aspect is being raised at the level of the European Commission. Questions are also being asked by the UN Committee against Torture. A simple assurance, such as that referred to by the Minister, is surely no longer satisfactory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We utterly condemn torture that is meted out in contravention of any of these conventions. When media reports have raised the specific issue of the use of Shannon, I have repeatedly instructed my officials to raise the matter with the US authorities. We have been given categorical assurances on this matter. It is the same situation as pertained over the past 50 years about the use of Shannon, whether it concerned Kosovo, Somalia or other events including Vietnam and Korea.</P>
        <P>The alleged use of what are called &ldquo;black sites&rdquo; in continental Europe has been raised recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Two days ago, Human Rights Watch released a statement providing additional background data about allegations that were supposed to have been made against two unnamed European states. Human Rights Watch said that aircraft alleged to have been involved in the transportation of prisoners by the CIA landed in airports in seven EU member states, namely Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, the Czech Republic and Greece, as well as in Switzerland and Macedonia which are outside the EU. There is no reference to Ireland in the statement. Human Rights Watch went on to say it was highly unlikely that this type of clandestine activity would operate out of a major civilian airport. The statement did not add &ldquo;such as Shannon&rdquo;, but obviously Shannon would be included in that.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that if anybody comes forward with any solid, credible evidence that any such activity is happening on our soil at Shannon, the Government will act on it. As my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, told the House on a previous occasion, a full investigation would take place in the event of such evidence arising. The US Administration has on many occasions given <Col N="1705"/>us categoric assurances. The US is a friendly state which has an incredible relationship with this country and for us to do anything other would imply that we do not believe those assurances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sometimes necessary to be frank in friendly relations with another country. It is important for the Minister to know that those members of Human Rights Watch who watched the plane landing in Shannon provided information that led to the conclusion drawn in the Swedish case. It is the same plane and its flight plan included destinations such as Morocco, Uzbekistan and Egypt, countries in which torture is practised.</P>
        <P>When we ratify the optional protocol against torture in 2006 it will be open to outside bodies to arrive in Ireland and seek to examine and convince themselves that people are not being transported in these planes.</P>
        <P>The Human Rights Watch report is interesting too about the circumstances in which an individual was removed from Sweden, if the Minister wishes to quote it. The individual&rsquo;s clothes were cut off and he was chained on a mattress while the Swedish authorities looked on in shock. Extraordinary rendition is the focus of this question. It is a major blow to international law. It is outside all the framework conventions. The Minister should think about this.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to ask a citizen or me as an Opposition spokesperson, to find the person in chains and a jump suit with a hood over his head, on a mattress in the plane. The only way to be truthful in support of both European Conventions mentioned in the question, and the United Nations Convention, is to say to the Government with which we have friendly relations: &ldquo;In order to satisfy the international concern and that of our citizens we propose to institute random searches, particularly of this plane, which has nothing to do with the arrangements that existed previously.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The plane in question is on contract to the US state department and is used by the CIA whose inspector general is quoted this morning as saying that what was permitted is outside the UN Convention against torture.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We have jurisdiction only in this territory. We can do nothing else. We can condemn torture if it happens elsewhere, and I would condemn it in Poland and Romania, where it is suggested it happens. No evidence, however, has been tendered to date to lead to a substantial belief, as is required under the European Court of Human Rights, in this issue. I encourage anyone to bring forward credible evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development cooperation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007. There are 42 people working within the Department with a stated intention of decentralising to Limerick, which is 34% of the total requirement.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is assessing a possible site in Limerick. The success of decentralisation depends on the early availability of a suitable building from the OPW. My officials completed a detailed implementation plan in March of this year and submitted it to the decentralisation implementation committee for its consideration. The plan addresses a variety of issues, including human resource considerations, training and development, business issues, risk management and accommodation needs. The plan, together with regular updates, can be accessed on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Already, a total of 26 posts in the directorate are filled by staff who have expressed an interest in decentralising to Limerick, including seven officers recruited from other Departments via the central applications facility and five staff recruited from interdepartmental promotion panels. There are a further 16 staff elsewhere in the Department, including abroad, who have also expressed the intention of decentralising to Limerick. The process of transferring to the directorate staff serving elsewhere in the Department and of recruiting staff via the central applications facility will be accelerated in the new year. The aim is that by the second half of 2006 most posts in the directorate will be filled by staff who will decentralise to Limerick.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 24 specialists based in the directorate headquarters and 11 applications have been received to date for these positions through the central applications facility. I hope more will volunteer as we approach the decentralisation deadline.</P><Col N="1707"/>
        <P>The Government is aware that the decentralisation process will take place during a period of significant growth in the overseas development aid budget and the strategies outlined in the implementation plan are designed to minimise these risks. Among the steps being taken are the following: to ensure continuity and to minimise disruption, Department officials are involved in detailed planning on strategies for retaining corporate memory and ensuring that there is adequate training and induction for new staff.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>To guard against a rapid turnover of staff in the months immediately preceding decentralisation to Limerick, the directorate has already started the process of bringing staff in from other Departments who have applied for decentralisation with Development Cooperation Ireland. The directorate&rsquo;s work involves liaising with other sections of the Department of Foreign Affairs, other Departments, NGOs such as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and Goal, and a wide range of international organisations. To help ensure continuing coherence, the Department, <i>inter alia</i>, will invest in and make considerable use of video-conferencing facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State agree that the decentralisation fiasco puts the development aid programme at risk? He is massaging the figures. There are 26 staff members out of 123 at DCI willing to decentralise to Limerick, approximately 21%. They do not know where they are going because two years on no property has been identified or bought in Limerick. People are being asked to decide to move without knowing where in Limerick they will go.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that with only 26 out of 123 signalling their willingness to go to Limerick there is a serious risk of wrong decisions being made? The result will be a loss of institutional memory. How can the Minister guarantee that we will get value for money on the programmes to be funded after decentralisation with such a serious loss of institutional memory?</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy may not be aware that DCI is a fully integrated part of the Department of Foreign Affairs, we are the Department. Although DCI has a different name it is a division of the Department, like the Europe division and so on.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is integrated in the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am not massaging figures &mdash; 42 people within the Department are prepared to decentralise to Limerick which represents 34% of the staff requirement we will need.</P>

	<P>We will be in a position to execute this move without any great loss to the <Col N="1709"/>programme. We have done our homework and the officials have put in place a serious risk management strategy to ensure that corporate memory is protected and there is a hand-over period of a month as one staff comes on board and another is moved to other duties. There will be proper induction and a centralised computer system to keep the corporate knowledge. This will include official files so they are not in sections but are available in a centralised manner.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>A great deal of action has been taken in preparation for this. No programme risk has occurred in other countries even though they are not only decentralising within their own countries but into the field in the developing countries they are seeking to assist. I find it incredible that we should not be decentralising to Limerick when some of our partner countries are decentralising to the field.</P>

	<P>Of the 15 or 16 senior development specialists, how many have indicated their willingness to decentralise?

	<P>Is it up to date?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is updated and monitored on a regular basis. Obviously we have development specialists in the field. Most of them are there, many of them local employees. Of the development specialists in headquarters, 11 out of the 24 have applied to go to Limerick and are prepared to go there. Of the senior specialist grades which the Deputy mentioned, and of which there are seven, none has currently indicated a willingness to move to Limerick. That is an issue for us because we would prefer to have these senior positions filled.</P>
        <P>Regarding other senior positions, our director-general, Mr. Murphy, has indicated that he will be transferring to Limerick to lead the process. We have an issue related to senior management. Of the ten team members, none has indicated a willingness to go to Limerick.</P>

	<P>Ireland was among the first countries to respond to the appalling disaster in South Asia. Within a few hours of the earthquake, &euro;1 million was pledged towards immediate relief efforts in northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions. As the casualty figures rose dramatically, our response was increased to &euro;5 million, placing Ireland as one of the highest donors to the disaster on a <i>per capita</i> basis.

        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s pledge to the disaster has been fully committed. It is essential that pledges are honoured so that vital assistance can be delivered to save lives.

Over &euro;2.5 million has been allocated to non-governmental organisations such as Concern, GOAL, Oxfam, Plan Ireland and Tr&oacute;caire, which are active in the provision of essential services on the ground. These services include the provision of food, health services, shelter, water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>Logistically, this disaster is one of the toughest challenges faced by the UN and the international community. Some 15,000 villages were affected and many are in areas which are difficult to reach. We are continually monitoring the situation in the region and officials from my Department will conduct a technical mission to the areas affected to meet with our partners on the ground and to report on the issues facing the region. Ireland will be represented at the reconstruction conference planned to take place in Islamabad on 19 November next.</P>
        <P>The updated UN &ldquo;flash appeal&rdquo; for the region has called for nearly $550 million in funding for immediate relief needs. A little over &euro;130 million has been pledged to date. Some of the pledges made by donors have yet to materialise into confirmed contributions. Even if all the pledges are confirmed, that still leaves a very considerable <Col N="1712"/>shortfall. I support President Musharraf&rsquo;s call for more generous assistance, specifically from Islamic, EU and OECD states. I have stressed the urgency of the provision of further aid and the importance of honouring pledges to my EU counterparts at a meeting of EU Development Ministers which was hosted by the British Presidency in Leeds in the past few weeks.</P>
        <P>It will take much analysis and probably the benefit of considerable hindsight to understand why one crisis may generate huge public support while another suffers a shortfall. We may never know the full answer to this. The international community&rsquo;s response to the tsunami disaster was overwhelming and very generous. However, there are many humanitarian crises in the world at any one time. They generate various levels of support. Regrettably some become &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; crises. That is why Ireland is a strong advocate of the principles and good practice of good humanitarian donorship or GHD. By leading donors, including Ireland, this initiative seeks to ensure the response to humanitarian crises is based purely on needs assessment and allocated according to the principles of independence, neutrality, humanity and impartiality.</P>
        <P>Ireland also supports the moves by the UN to strengthen the international response to humanitarian crises. The number and scale of natural disasters this year reinforces the need for global resources to be mobilised and deployed rapidly to bring humanitarian relief on a large scale to anywhere in the world. Ireland has been actively focussing on how we can better respond to such emergencies.</P>
        <P>Internationally, Ireland supports the enhancement of the UN&rsquo;s central emergency relief fund and I have pledged &euro;10 million to that end.</P>
        <P el="10">
          <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>.</P>
        <P>This will create a new grant-based fund that will allow UN agencies to respond more immediately and effectively in the face of a sudden on-set of a disaster. Work is also continuing at EU level to improve civil protection and rapid response capability through the tsunami follow-up action plan. The further development of rapid response capacity must complement and support the UN&rsquo;s primary role as coordinator in humanitarian disasters. At the national level, we are examining ways in which the Government&rsquo;s response to disasters and emergencies can be enhanced through a more operational role. That work is being actively pursued.</P>
        <P>With regard to the contribution of other donors, the UN financial tracking system maintains information on donors&rsquo; contributions to UN appeals and more broadly on donors&rsquo; contributions to particular emergencies. According to the information available to my Department in relation to the South Asia earthquake, the <i>per capita</i> donor contribution to date is set out in a table which I have made available to Deputies.</P><Col N="1713"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>My question concentrated mostly on the international response and while I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s detailed comments on the Irish response, it is on the international response I would like to ask him some further questions.</P>
        <P>The reality, which requires little analysis, is that $550 million has been sought, and of that, as the Minister of State noted, $133 million has been pledged. Of that latter figure, $84 million has been received. That is where we stand. We now have 3 million people on their 30th night of living in the open with a specific request for their needs of 100,000 to 200,000 tents. The death rates, though we cannot judge their accuracy, are not below 175,000 with 70,000 injured. That needs further analysis and there are questions of remoteness.</P>
        <P>The issue is that of the international community&rsquo;s response which is running at less than 25% of Kofi Annan&rsquo;s appeal. While it will be interesting to compare one set of responses to another, there has been an outrageous neglect in terms of the response, which represents a moral challenge.</P>
        <P>Europe has been very good at responding. I am not pointing a finger, but the additional &euro;80 million being suggested by the European Commission is conditional on approval by the Council of Ministers in the European Parliament. Has that approval been given? The issue is simply one <Col N="1714"/>of the European Commission responding to the international outrage at the huge shortfall on this very obvious appeal.</P>
        <P>We can identify the needs and the costs involved but help has not been provided, nor has there been movement with regard to the tents required by 2 million people. Are the mechanisms for approval in place? The Minister of State referred to the November conference but that will be too late. The figures for reconstruction are welcome and will be valuable in the spring but it will be too late by then for hundreds of thousands of people. Funding is needed now for an immediate response. While I support the Government on its proposals to the UN for emergency mechanisms to respond to disasters, the misery of the response on this occasion is atypical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s utter frustration in this regard. I do not wish to be seen as patting ourselves on the back but Ireland has responded consistently and rapidly to every humanitarian crisis of 2005. As the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, insisted at the beginning of the year with regard to the tsunami, we have diligently tracked these pledges and held countries to account so that promises are honoured and the delivery of money is not delayed. We deliver in a timely manner so it is a cause of frustration to us that some countries which pledge do not deliver and some do not pledge. Why have <Col N="1715"/>some people been timely in responding to other crises but not with regard to the events in Pakistan?</P>
        <P>I met Pakistan&rsquo;s ambassador to Dublin, who pleaded with me to put pressure on other donor countries, including other European countries, to provide money to help these people who, as the Deputy noted, are in a desperate and unconscionable situation. I have decided to write to my European Union colleagues and to other countries which have not contributed to this appeal to put them under pressure.</P>
        <P>Last Monday, the Minister attended a meeting of European Union Foreign Ministers, at which Jack Straw, in his role as President of the Council, put further pressure on our European colleagues to provide money. This task is not easy because evidence of previous crises suggests that certain countries specialise in making pledges but do not deliver on them. We have asked, at OECD and UN level, that such response be tracked and reported on.</P>
        <P>I cannot shed light on the Deputy&rsquo;s query on the European Union&rsquo;s &euro;18 million but I can revert to him on the matter. The Commission has a stand-by response fund of &euro;5 million which can be spent immediately without needing to consult the mechanisms referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>A proposal has been made for at least &euro;80 million and we await the response of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally speaking, the European response is good. The Minister made strong representations at every level in terms of equipping Europe with a more appropriate and speedy civil response mechanism. He consistently identified such a priority at meetings throughout this year and we intend to follow that up.</P>
        <P>It is frustrating that not everyone is like us in providing money. Alongside the Nordic states and the UK, we are part of a like-minded group of countries which is performing well. These circumstances are mirrored in the wider development scene. Europe is delivering on long-term development financial assistance in terms of target dates for the achievement of 0.7%, but other countries, including wealthy G8 members, cause me deep despondency by not delivering on percentage commitments.</P>
        <P>I made a pledge in New York with regard to the central emergency relief fund and we will back it if a proper mechanism is devised. Such a fund is badly needed because it is criminal to assign to the UN the primary role in responding to these types of human and natural disasters if the organisation is not funded to respond in a timely manner. We are moving to address that matter.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1716"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we fast-track the response to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament with regard to the &euro;80 million?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will inquire of the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Mr. Louis Michel, whether that can be done and will revert to the Deputy. As Europe has its own ways of working, I am reluctant to give a firm commitment on that matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 67 together.</P>
        <P>I was appalled by the reported statement by President Ahmadinejad on 26 October on the existence of the state of Israel. Officials of my Department immediately contacted the Iranian Embassy in Dublin to convey the Government&rsquo;s clear view that the reported comments of the President were entirely unacceptable. The ambassador of Iran was not in Dublin &mdash; we have since been formally notified that he has been recalled by his Government &mdash; and our views were conveyed at the most senior diplomatic level available. I also made a public statement condemning the reported comments and in subsequent media interviews repeated the view already conveyed to the Iranian authorities that remarks on these lines can only have a negative effect in a troubled region and contribute nothing to relations between the EU and Iran.</P>
        <P>The President&rsquo;s statement came on the day of another horrific suicide attack in Israel which took the lives of five people and injured many more. I strongly condemned this attack and expressed my concern that the President of Iran should have chosen to make these comments against such a background of hate-inspired violence.</P>
        <P>On the same day, the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan, expressed his dismay at the remarks <Col N="1717"/>of President Ahmadinejad and on 28 October they were condemned by the UN Security Council. The Secretary General has also postponed a planned visit to Iran.</P>
        <P>The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 7 November, also condemned the President&rsquo;s comments in the strongest terms. The Council deplored calls for violence and for the destruction of any state. It emphasised that these comments cause concern about Iran&rsquo;s role in the region and its future intentions.</P>
        <P>I welcome the immediate and firm response of the international community on this issue. The Iranian Government can have been left in no doubt of the international isolation in which its President&rsquo;s remarks placed it. It is notable that the Iranian Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has already stated publicly that Iran is not threatening any other state.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future with a view to the reduction of tensions in the region, the General Affairs and External Relations Council underlined the long-standing importance which the EU attaches to sustainable political and economic reform in Iran and the importance of the comprehensive dialogue between the EU and Iran as an appropriate framework for discussing issues of mutual interest and concern. These include areas of long-standing concern to the EU, such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Iran&rsquo;s approach to the Middle East peace process, human rights and fundamental freedoms and regional issues. The evolution of the long-term relationship, including the avoidance of a deterioration in relations between the EU and Iran, will depend on action by Iran to address effectively all the EU&rsquo;s concerns.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have tabled Question No. 9 on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme, I will discuss that issue further when the question is being addressed.</P>
        <P>My original question concerned the communications made with the ambassador. There have been press reports that the ambassador, who came here in June, was arrested in Teheran during his summer holidays and is now being held on charges in Evin prison. Has official notification been received from the Iranian Embassy regarding the status of the ambassador?</P>
        <P>I condemn the outrageous comments made by the President of Iran with regard to Israel. His statement is merely a further example of the incitements of that region. What does the European Union plan in response to the statement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Iranian ambassador is not in residence in Dublin. Previous to the President&rsquo;s comments, we were made aware from newspaper reports of the detention but we only received official word in the past week to the effect that he is no longer the ambassador.</P><Col N="1718"/>
        <P>I note the Deputy&rsquo;s response to the Iranian President&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>The EU response was issued last Monday. It was a very strong response from the 25 members of the EU. However, this is built into the issue of the nuclear programme currently in place in Iran. The discussions on the nuclear issue are at a very sensitive phase and in the next fortnight there will be a board of governors&rsquo; meeting of the IAEA. Obviously we are trying to arrive at a situation where the dialogue that has taken place, but which is now temporarily suspended, will be renewed. Ultimately, we want to arrive at a point where there is full transparency regarding what is going on in Iran with its nuclear programme to ensure that it fits in with the NPT.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I issued a statement some time ago, when the Iranian President&rsquo;s comments were made, which was very similar to that issued by the Minister. I condemned the comments. Question No. 67 refers to the response of the UN Security Council. I suggest that it is significant that the Security Council was unanimous in issuing its statement.</P>
        <P>With reference to the IAEA, the Non-proliferation Treaty needs to be revived in terms of the fullness of its articles, with its obligations on the existing nuclear powers clearly being addressed again. One could argue that the Irish position at the founding of this treaty at the United Nations was very significant. Then we had partial compliance by the super powers for a period but in more recent times the suggestion has arisen that non-proliferation can be interpreted almost exclusively in terms of newly-acquiring States. This is a serious fault line in the international process.</P>
        <P>Question No. 67 also refers to the question of reducing tensions in the area and we need to see positive movement on this issue. The Iranian statements against Israel I have condemned unequivocally, as all people should. However, there is also the issue of significant progress on the Palestinian issue, requiring a reduction in the settlement activity, in accordance with the quartet proposals, on the part of Israel itself.</P>
        <P>We are right to keep the issue of the comments on Israel by Iran as one of straight condemnation, shared by the international community. However, making progress on the other issues affecting Iran requires putting them in the context of a revived interest in the general principles of the Non-proliferation Treaty and also of regional strategies, including stopping Israeli extension of its settlement activity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has put the issue very well. As I have said, the result of the UN summit and the review conference on NPT was nothing short of a disgrace and I said as much in my statement on behalf of Ireland at that time. It <Col N="1719"/>was, and is, hypocritical for the larger powers, that already have nuclear arms, to put a strong emphasis on non-proliferation when in fact, the NPT is also a disarmament treaty and should be seen as such.</P>
        <P>There are two sides to this argument and that is why I welcomed what Mr. Kofi Annan said at the end of the UN Summit, in his initial words, where he said that it was &ldquo;a disgrace&rdquo; on the international community. I have pledged that Ireland, as one of the authors of the NPT, will assist in whatever way it can. Unfortunately, we are in a world that is even more dangerous now than it was during the post-war era when the NPT was put in place. There are also a number of countries, some of which are in the Middle East, that are not party to the NPT. At least Iran is party to NPT. The important thing now is to keep Iran within that system so that we can use the instruments available to the international community in this respect.</P>
        <P>While it is correct to say that the comment on Israel is a separate issue and should be condemned separately, all of this is interlinked. It is linked with the ongoing conflict in Palestine and Israel.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Stanton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the amount of outstanding EU legislation awaiting transposition into Irish law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33301/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government attaches priority to the transposition of EU legislation into Irish law. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Treacy, chairs an interdepartmental committee which meets regularly and has as one of its functions the monitoring of this transposition. The Government is committed to attaining the agreed transposition target of 1.5% as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>The latest figures on transpositions are contained in the EU internal market scoreboard for July 2005. This shows the record of each member state in transposing internal market directives into national law. Ireland is in 12th position, with a transposition deficit of 1.6%, just outside the transposition target. A total of 11 member states have met the target, with deficits ranging from 0.8% to 1.4%. Among the 25 member states, the highest transposition deficit stands at 4.1%, while the transposition deficit across the European Union as a whole is 1.9%.</P>
        <P>The next scoreboard will be published in January 2006. As of 1 November, 30 directives have not yet been transposed or are only partially transposed into national law.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1720"/>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that the transposition delays are unacceptable?</P>
        <P>I ask him to confirm that there are three directives with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, dating back to 2001, that have not been transposed and that four infringement proceedings have now been served on the Department. I also ask the Minister to confirm that there were seven directives awaiting transposition last June. Can he tell me whether any of these have been transposed since then?</P>
        <P>Since 1997 the Department of Education and Science has received two warnings arising from failure to transpose directives on time. Can the Minister confirm that there are 21 directives awaiting transposition in the Department of Agriculture and Food, one of which is late? In the Department of Transport, Directive 2002 of 11 March 2002 on working times for road hauliers, was not enacted into law by the deadline of 25 March.</P>
        <P>Why does the Government delay and stall its obligations to transpose EU directives in a timely manner? Does the Minister agree, despite what he just said about league tables and so forth, that this failure places Ireland in a very bad light on the European stage, particularly given the threat of infringement proceedings against the State?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Between 2000 and 2005, Ireland was supposed to transpose 1068 directives and has, to date, transposed 1045, which is not a bad record. In fact, if one looks at the figures for when this Government came into office, we are now three times better than we were at that time, in terms of the percentage. In 1997, the transposition deficit figure was 5.4%, which was probably one of the worst in the EU. We are now just ahead of the average for the EU 25 of 1.9%. We are better than the EU 15 average of 2.1% and the EU 10 average of 1.1.7%.</P>
        <P>At the moment there are 30 directive transpositions outstanding. There are nine in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and five overdue in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with two further directives partially transposed. There are five outstanding in the Department of Transport, four in the Department of Health and Children, three in the Department of Agriculture and Food and one in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The record is quite good and the figures stack up. We are, through the interdepartmental group chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, constantly exhorting our colleagues to ensure that these directives are transposed in a timely manner. The only action being taken against the State at the moment relates to alleged inaccuracies. It does not relate to a failure to transpose EU legislation but to the way in which it was transposed. A number of actions are being taken across <Col N="1721"/>Departments. However, they are not significant compared with some other countries that are way behind us.</P>

	<P>I would like to the think that the Minister&rsquo;s Department was supported by a greater intake than is revealed in the table. It is interesting that in 2004 there were 115 consultancies and the total intake through departmental recruitment that year was 65. Given that there was an intake in 2002 of 201 and the fact that we were preparing for the increased role of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which I support, at the level of the European Union and the United Nations in international organisations, in particular, the projected increase in the other table which relates to the development division between now and 2012, it appears incredible that, allowing for retirements, leave and so on, the Department is recruiting such a small number. If we are to meet our commitments on overseas development aid by 2012, including the announced expansion in representation abroad, <Col N="1722"/>which I support, I do not understand how this can be achieved with this level of intake. Does the Minister propose to go to the Minister for Finance and seek departure from any such embargoes to achieve the policy objectives of his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has no problem fulfilling its functions with the existing cohort of staff personnel. In regard to engaging 500 consultancies over the past five years, 87% of them are in the area of overseas development aid. Most of them are small time related consultancies because we do not have this expertise within the Department. They ensure value for taxpayers&rsquo; money in regard to the development programmes, mainly across sub-Saharan Africa. I assure the Deputy that the larger intake of consultancies is due to the expansion of the ODA <Col N="1723"/>programme. As there will be a substantial increase in funding for the ODA programme in the Estimates next week, I have no doubt the number of consultancies will expand even further, and this will happen again in 2007.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister in a position to say whether the advisory committee&rsquo;s commissioned reports on the staffing needs of the Department, such as the Cassidy report and others, will be implemented?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if there is an age limit. I do not have the figures, but if there is, I can get the figures for the Deputy. I would not like to think there is an age limit other than the normal limit that exists in the public service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 59 together.</P>
        <P>Negotiations between the EU three and Iran are suspended following Iran&rsquo;s decision on 8 August 2005 to recommence conversion of uranium at its Isfahan facility. This action was in breach of the Paris Agreement signed by Iran and the EU three, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in November 2004. Under this agreement, Iran, <i>inter alia,</i> re-affirmed that it did not and would not seek to acquire nuclear weapons and committed itself to full transparency and co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Iran decided voluntarily to suspend all enrichment and reprocessing activities and to invite the IAEA to verify and monitor the suspension. In return, the EU three agreed to commence negotiations with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on long-term arrangements in the areas of political and security issues, technology and co-operation and nuclear issues.</P><Col N="1724"/>
        <P>At the board of governors meeting at the IAEA last September, the EU three co-sponsored a resolution that found Iran to be non-compliant with the agency&rsquo;s statute. The board now has the option to refer Iran to the UN Security Council at a future date. To avoid such referral, Iran has been urged, <i>inter alia,</i> to re-establish full and sustained suspension of uranium conversion and to implement transparency measures, including provision of documentation relating to its nuclear programme and providing IAEA inspectors with access to facilities. The resolution also requested the director general of the IAEA to continue his efforts to implement the resolution and previous resolutions and to report back to the board of governors on any developments on issues raised in his September report. On the basis of this future report, the board of governors will decide what further action should be taken on Iran.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council earlier this week reiterated its grave concern at Iran&rsquo;s resumption of activity at the uranium conversion facility in Isfahan. The Council urged Iran to implement all measures requested by the IAEA board of governors in its resolution on 24 September, including reinstating a full suspension of all fuel cycle activities thus allowing negotiations with the European side to resume before the IAEA board meets again in November. The Council underlined the EU&rsquo;s continued support for a diplomatic solution to international concerns over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme and agreed to keep the EU&rsquo;s approach to Iran under close review in light of progress on the nuclear file and other issues of concern. While the Iranian Foreign Minister recently wrote to EU colleagues proposing a resumption of negotiations, Iran has so far taken none of the measures requested by the IAEA board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response and for his earlier comments regarding the failure of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty talks. The level of hypocrisy and double standards is breathtaking. The reckless attitude of some states is something we could all live to regret because the longer the indecision and double standards continue, the greater the risk that nuclear materials will fall into the hands of terrorist groups. We could all be at risk at that stage.</P>
        <P>My question referred to the EU three, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, representing the EU in talks with Iran. At the meeting earlier this week, where a review of the Iranian situation took place, was consideration given to an opinion which exists that, because of their chequered history, the three countries involved may not be the best countries to represent the European Union in dealing with Iran and its nuclear programme? Has consideration been given to bringing on <Col N="1725"/>board, for example, Ireland because of its record in regard to the non-proliferation treaty? A Minister said recently that we do not have the expertise to deal with these complex issues. Has any consideration been given to bringing on board countries like Ireland to deal with this problem? We have the expertise and the scientific back-up and there are no such barriers to our involvement. However, there are barriers because of the chequered past of some of the countries involved at present. Has a review taken place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A review has not taken place. We have full confidence in the three countries involved. We are fully informed and briefed at all the meetings that feed into the GAERC meetings that I attend. We get full and frank disclosure of the discussions that take place. It is difficult as it is a stop start issue as regards the relationship with Iran. It is important we engage with them in a diplomatic way because the international community is looking to the EU3 and the EU as the brokers. It is one issue on which the international community needs to be vigilant in the months and years ahead because the potential for further destabilising of this area is plain to see in some of the injudicious remarks that have been made. It is vital that we negotiate in a diplomatic way rather than using bully-boy tactics with a country such as Iran, which is pivotal in this area. I had occasion to meet with the representative of Iran some months ago in the UN &mdash; I think the Deputy was in the vicinity &mdash; and when he asked me about the nuclear issue as a member of the EU I made clear to him Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing position in regard to nuclear disarmament and the entire nuclear defence and non-defence issue. He clearly said to me that as far as they were concerned they were only doing what they were entitled to do under the NPT which was to have a civilian nuclear industry. I said that so long as it was that type of facility, even though we did not agree with it as a policy in Ireland, if they were prepared to allow it to be independently inspected that would be sufficient for the EU. Unfortunately the inspections that have taken place under the aegis of the IAEA have not been transparent and some of the issues that have been unearthed lead the international community to be very concerned.</P>
        <P>To return to the Deputy&rsquo;s central point, we have full confidence in those countries, particularly the EU3 in that they do have far more expertise in the area of nuclear armaments and defence capabilities from a nuclear point of view than Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that one of the lasting consequences of the war in Iraq is that the position of Iran has been strengthened substantially and that the Shiites in Iraq are in the ascendency? Will he agree this is partly the <Col N="1726"/>reason the Iranians have been emboldened to move forward with a nuclear programme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not honestly know. They maintain they have made a decision to put in place nuclear energy facilities in their state which is their entitlement under the NPT. It was made clear to me when I met the Iranian ambassador to the UN that they had made a policy decision to go nuclear and that they were putting in place facilities. He had with him a member of the Iranian Parliament who said that because of the impending elections their ability, or non-ability, to move on this was a strong political issue within Iran. The Deputy asked if this had emboldened on them in this area. I cannot honestly say but this area is a tinderbox and it has to be dealt with strongly and to a large extent in a diplomatic way. We have to show there is a mutual interest for the EU, the wider international community and also for Iran in regard to better relationships with a block such as the EU which is on its doorstep.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Currently the new regional aid designations are being considered by the Government and the European Union. The south-east region has made application through its director, <Col N="1727"/>Mr. Tom Byrne, by letter dated 29 August 2005 to the Department of Finance for consideration and approval for designation under the draft guidelines on national regional aid for 2007-13. While the regional aid guidelines will be set by the European Commission the qualifying areas will be selected by national governments, in this case the Irish Government. I strongly support the case of the south-east region, including south Tipperary, for designation for regional aid purposes.</P>
        <P>The position in the south east is that it has lost out economically in recent times. Unemployment rates in the south east generally are approximately 131% of the national average, which is one of the criteria for designation. In the submission from the south-east region, its director said it is clearly the case that the south-east region meets the unemployment criteria for regional designation, that is to be higher than the national average by 115%. Currently, the region&rsquo;s unemployment rate stands at 131% the average and for the same period in 2004 the region&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 20% higher than the national average. The rate of unemployment in the south east is consistently a percentage point higher than the national average and currently it is 5.4% as against a national average of 4.1%.</P>
        <P>A number of unemployment blackspots have been identified by the south-east regional authority in Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford. In the case of my county, Carrick-on-Suir is one of the identified blackspots which has an unemployment rate of 20.6%, five times the national average. I have raised that issue here on a number of occasions. There is a number of unemployment blackspots in Waterford city while the Enniscorthy urban area has an unemployment rate of 20.6%.</P>
        <P>On the issue of household income relative to the national average, the south east stands at 92.2% as against 113.4% in Dublin, and 93.9% in the west. The west has already been designated for Category 1 status regional aid. Disposable income per person in south Tipperary at &euro;15,228 lags behind north Tipperary at &euro;16,414. It is even behind counties that already have Category 1 status like Galway, which has &euro;16,094 and Sligo with approximately &euro;15,500 and Louth with &euro;15,900. In the south east 19.7% of the workforce have third level qualifications as against 26% nationally. I ask the Minister to consider the case of the south east seriously. I my view and that of the regional authority it qualifies for designation. The rules for designation give flexibility to the Government and the Minister should seriously consider designating south Tipperary and the south east region for this regional aid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this <Col N="1728"/>question as it provides an opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding Ireland&rsquo;s continued eligibility for Objective One status under the European Union&rsquo;s Cohesion Policy. The main goal of Cohesion Policy in the European Union is economic and social cohesion. This is based on financial solidarity, whereby more than one third of the Union&rsquo;s budget is transferred to those regions lagging behind in their development, undergoing restructuring or facing specific geographical, economic or social problems. Priority is given to poorer regions to enable them to better address their challenges and difficulties and to benefit fully from the opportunities offered by the single market by underpinning their long-term structural development.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for Objective One status, or the Convergence Priority as it will be known after 2006, applies to designated Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, level 2 regions. Eligibility is determined independently by the European Commission based on a range of economic and social indicators and is not determined by the governments of the member states. Only those NUTS 2 regions with a <i>per capita</i> gross domestic product lower than 75% of the Union&rsquo;s average are eligible under Objective One. Both of Ireland&rsquo;s NUTS 2 regions, the Border, midland and western and the southern and eastern regions, have GDP figures above this level.</P>
        <P>Under this criterion, neither of the Irish regions will be eligible for the Convergence Priority after 2006. This is a reflection of the degree of economic progress the country has achieved since Objective One was last determined and which underpinned our eligibility for the 2000 to 2006 round of Structural Funds. The southern and eastern region has a figure of approximately 142% of the EU 25 average. This is well above the threshold level. The BMW region is nearly 94%.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s proposals for Cohesion Policy after 2006 have been broadly welcomed by the Government. We fully recognise the impact of our improved economic position and accept that one of the consequences of this success is that Ireland as a whole will lose Objective One status after 2006. We support the Commission proposals to concentrate the Union&rsquo;s resources on supporting the development of the new member states as a priority. It is important to keep in mind that both Irish regions will continue to benefit from Cohesion Policy from 2007 onwards. However, it should be appreciated that the level of Structural Funds available under the next round will be much reduced. Despite this, Structural Funds can continue to play an important role in the continued economic and social development of the regions.</P>
        <P>Funding in the next round will be deployed in accordance with a broad strategic framework oriented to achieve regional competitiveness and <Col N="1729"/>support the Lisbon Agenda. The emphasis will be on investment in innovation, in research and development and in the knowledge economy and on improving the employment opportunities for under-skilled workers. The Government has already agreed that the regional assemblies will play a more central role in developing operational programmes for the future programming period. Assembly members will have a significant challenge in determining the priorities, themes or geographic areas to be funded and will be able to articulate local and regional issues and solutions as part of this process.</P>
        <P>Ireland has had a good track record in investing Structural Funds in productive activities. We have used them well and they have assisted our development so that we will no longer be eligible for funding at the highest rate. The challenge now is to ensure that future funding is used in an innovative manner to address residual development needs where the added value of cohesion policy can clearly be demonstrated. The issues raised by the Deputy are probably more appropriate for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I will ask that Department to respond to the issue he raised.</P>

      <sTitle>Flood Relief.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. Since I entered public life many years ago one of the main issues taken up by me and by practically all public representatives in my constituency and particularly in Kilkenny is the need to drain the River Nore or to provide solutions to the flooding problems. It would have been foolish for any aspiring candidate for public office not to include such an objective in his or her campaign leaflets. I can remember at the young age of ten the flood that hit Kilkenny in March 1947. At that time my grandparents were isolated in their house with the water rising to a level of 6 ft. or 7 ft. It was a miracle that no lives were lost at that time.</P>
        <P>There have been many severe floods in the Nore and its tributary the Breagagh. These occur annually and sometimes many times per year. With the decision to carry out the work on the Nore several years ago came a sense of confidence and pride. The work cost &euro;48 million. I never had a problem with such an amount of money for this very essential work. I would fully support whatever it took to do the job and say it was well worth the money. Naturally I have not been in Kilkenny in recent days as I have been here in the House. When I read this morning&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> with a screaming headline &ldquo;Anti-flood scheme failed&rdquo;, I was aghast. It men<Col N="1730"/>tioned that parts of the city were flooded. It is important to assure the public that this scheme has been successful and will be successful.</P>
        <P>My main purpose for raising this matter on the Adjournment was to give the Minister of State the opportunity to state that in the House. When I read the news this morning I did not know what to think. I hope the Minister of State can give the assurance to allow people to view this scheme with confidence and pride. Excellent work was carried out and I have no problem with the cost. If that was what it took to do the job, every penny was justified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am glad to have the opportunity to put on the record the facts regarding flooding in Kilkenny. While I understand from where the Deputy got his information the facts are quite different to the headline in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>. We have seen other lurid headlines and photographs in that newspaper regarding the difficulty for fish with the flood relief scheme, which were also grossly exaggerated.</P>
        <P>The Kilkenny flood relief scheme referred to in the motion is functioning perfectly to prevent flooding of homes and businesses in the city. The scheme has not failed and the flooding which occurred in recent days is not due to any breach, leak or other failure of the scheme. Flooding took place in the Canal Walk area and the Waterbarracks area. As both areas are designated flood plains they can be expected to flood periodically, but this flooding is not expected to cause significant damage or disruption. In this case the flooding in the Canal Walk area occurred when water from the canal overflowed on to Canal Walk. Contrary to the report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i>, the river did not &ldquo;burst its banks&rdquo;. Water had backed up in the canal due to a temporary culvert constructed by the contractor for the scheme to facilitate his access to the works. The culvert in question was removed yesterday.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The flooding on the football pitch in the Waterbarracks area commenced last week, on Wednesday, 2 November 2005. It has been suggested that an accumulation of debris at the trash rack on the River Breagagh contributed to the flooding, but this is not the case. The trash rack is inspected regularly by OPW staff who have confirmed that it was clear of debris on 2 November. The flooding was caused by an increase in flood waters. This brought an increase in debris and rubbish with it. The trash rack was again cleaned by OPW <Col N="1731"/>on Tuesday last, as soon as it was safely accessible. OPW staff have confirmed that when cleaning the rack, as well as removing normal river debris such as branches of trees etc. they also removed bags of clothes, carpets and bags of domestic rubbish from the river. The staff concerned have pointed out that this is a regular occurrence.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the flood relief scheme is to protect homes and businesses affected by flooding and in this it is an out and out success. The scheme sought to maintain the natural flood plains where possible. The areas retained as flood plains are those where the impact on homes and businesses is at a minimum, areas like Canal Walk and the football pitch at the Waterbarracks. The retention of these areas as flood plains was part of the exhibited flood relief scheme and was fully approved by the local authority.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to discuss this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who is here to represent the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and hear what I have to say on this important matter.</P>
        <P>The Elphin playschool committee has been in existence since May 2004 and it applied for a grant at that time for equipment and staffing. The committee started providing a service in September 2004 and has continued to provide that service. There are currently 19 children in the facility. The unit caters mostly for children of one-parent families, those in social housing and those with income difficulties. Only four of the children have parents in full-time employment.</P>
        <P>Despite having applied for a grant in May 2004 and having provided a service since September of that year, the Department has still not grant-aided this group. The only support the playschool has got is a grant of &euro;10,000 from the children at risk fund and a grant of approximately &euro;1,700 from the former Western Health Board, now the HSE, western area.</P>
        <P>I find it difficult to understand that no progress has been made on the case of this community group in almost two years. That there is a need for this facility goes without saying. The local district nurse has identified that approximately 130 children under the age of five live in the Elphin area. Currently there are three staff in the facility, two of whom are paid from the limited fees paid by the families of the children. The third member of staff is an employee from the rural social scheme.</P>
        <P>There appears to be a turf war going on in the Elphin area between the private provider who was grant-aided by the Department, and who got <Col N="1732"/>&euro;50,000 some years ago, and the people providing the community facility. I favour the community facility on the basis that it is necessary on account of the low income level of the parents of the children and the difficulties faced by families in social housing.</P>
        <P>I have tried to deal with the problem at local level but it has not been resolved. I was involved in the grant the unit got from the children at risk fund. This community facility will fold if it is not grant-aided and supported in the work it is trying to do. The seven-member committee has the support of the local community and provides a necessary service.</P>
        <P>I understand from reports that difficulties have arisen, but I cannot understand why they cannot be resolved. Surely the representatives of ADM or the county child care committee and this group can get together and resolve the difficulties. The Minister in charge of this major fund has provided wonderful services throughout the country and I compliment him on the fine services that have been provided at over 30 locations in County Roscommon. However, Elphin is a small town that needs a community child care facility. It seems the difficulties in providing it cannot be resolved locally. Therefore, I ask that the Minister or an official of the Department try to resolve the problems. The children who need the service must come first. The difficulties between the various groups involved are only secondary.</P>
        <P>The provision of community child care facilities for our children is paramount. The Minister must send instructions that the problems must be resolved and that those involved get on with the application for capital and staffing for Elphin playschool committee.</P>

	<P>As Deputy Finneran knows, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has responsibility for this area of Government policy, but his ministerial duties demand his presence elsewhere this evening.</P>
        <P>Deputy Finneran has referred to a particular facility in Elphin, County Roscommon, and to the local county child care committee in Roscommon. In response to the Deputy, it is necessary to give a brief explanation of the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, for which the Minister has responsibility and to outline how this major Government investment programme in child care is implemented at local level, through the network of city and county child care committees.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government and the progress of the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06 are confirmation of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing child care services to support the child care needs of the parents of Ireland, with particular emphasis on those who may be in employment or in education or training to prepare for employment. The <Col N="1733"/>EOCP has both an equal opportunities and a social inclusion perspective and aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 55%, or 31,300 additional places, by programme end. Current forecasts of impact suggest that it will ultimately create at least 39,000 places, including over 26,000 which have already been achieved.</P>
        <P>The first meeting of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 was held within a month of the Government changeover in 1997 and all the evidence shows that child care has been high on our agenda since that time. The Government has consistently moved promptly, purposefully and proactively to facilitate the development of a top quality child care service across the length and breadth of the country to support parents, the economy and social inclusion through labour market participation.</P>
        <P>Since the Government came into office for the second time, it has further increased the funding provision for the development of child care by over &euro;60 million. This includes part of the additional capital provision of &euro;90 million made available by the Minister for Finance in budget 2005 over the period 2005 to 2009 to develop child care infrastructure. It brings the allocation for the current programme to approximately &euro;500 million.</P>
        <P>Turning to the 33 city and county child care committees, these were set up in 2001 as companies limited by guarantee and supported by full-time paid staff. As part of the Government&rsquo;s overall strategic aim of improving co-operation and co-ordination of local development structures at county level, the CCCs operate as working groups of the city-county development boards and the chair of each CCC is also a member of the board. This linkage is important to the development of an integrated approach to child care needs in county development plans. Each committee is composed of representatives from the relevant statutory bodies, trade unions, employers and farmers, the national voluntary organisations, child care providers and parents. Committee membership is on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>The 33 CCCs each have a five-year strategic plan for child care. These plans are based on a shared vision and analysis of the child care needs within the county. Each CCC draws up an annual action plan setting out its proposals for implementing the strategic plans in a given year. The action plans are appraised by Area Development Management Limited. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sets the annual budget allocations. Each CCC reports on a quarterly basis to ADM on its quantitative and qualitative results and submits an annual report at the end of each year. The CCCs are represented on the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee through two regional assembly representatives.</P><Col N="1734"/>
        <P>In 2005, the CCCs received over &euro;7.6 million in funding to enable them to implement their action plans for the year. CCCs are charged with advancing child care service provision in their local areas. For example, they develop co-ordinated strategies for child care services in the relevant county, based on an analysis of needs, and oversee the effective implementation of such strategies against set targets. They are also responsible for developing an information strategy relating to the provision of child care in the county. The information strategies update and develop the baseline data provided in the national child care census. The CCCs also develop local countywide networks and initiatives which target all categories of child care providers. The role of the CCCs has evolved in a very short time. CCCs now play a key role at local level, as envisaged by the Partnership 2000 expert working group on child care. The effectiveness of that role has been endorsed by ADM in its annual survey of grant beneficiaries under the equal opportunities child care programme and by the external OECD panel of early childhood care and education experts, which reviewed the sector on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about the project mentioned by Deputy Finneran. The Elphin community playgroup submitted capital and staffing grant applications under the equal opportunities child care programme to the child care directorate of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in May 2004. The applications were forwarded to ADM, which is engaged by the Department to conduct detailed assessments of all grant applications under the programme. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment to ensure it meets the programme&rsquo;s funding criteria. As part of the assessment process, the view of the relevant CCC is sought on each application before ADM&rsquo;s recommendation is forwarded to the programme appraisal committee and a final decision is made by the Department. I understand there was extensive contact between the CCC in Roscommon and the group in question prior to and since the submission of the applications and that the CCC has informed the group that a number of aspects of the current proposal are problematic. I have been advised that, following a meeting between the CCC and the group on 15 September last, the group is considering the withdrawal of its current applications and submitting revised proposals with the assistance of the CCC. As the current applications are in the final stages of the assessment process, it would be premature of me to comment further.</P>
        <P>Many child care services in County Roscommon have benefited from grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme, as Deputy Finneran has said. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has announced funding of almost &euro;6.3 million for child care services in <Col N="1735"/>the county, thereby facilitating the creation of 360 new child care places and supporting 610 existing places across the county. Since budget 2005 was announced in December 2004, the Minister has announced a record allocation of &euro;112 million in capital funding for community based, not-for-profit groups. The availability of additional capital funding allows the Minister to make further capital grant assistance available to groups which address significant child care service gaps, if the <Col N="1736"/>proposed project represents good value for money. It is fair to emphasise that the equal opportunities child care programme has been central to the recent development of child care services in Ireland. Such services will continue to flourish under the careful stewardship of the Government.</P>

	<P>The core objective of Irish assistance to Palestine is to alleviate the material consequences of the ongoing conflict, by enhancing the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s partners in Palestine, particularly the Palestinian Authority, to respond to the crisis and to begin, where possible, to meet the future development needs of the Palestinian people.</P>
        <P>By the end of 2005, it is estimated that Ireland will have delivered over &euro;4 million in development and humanitarian assistance to Palestine. This assistance covers all of the Palestinian Territories, including Gaza and the West Bank. This funding focuses on support to basic education, local government, civil society and the United Nations&rsquo; agencies.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is a key partner for Ireland in the provision of basic services to the Palestinian people. In 2004, UNRWA received &euro;2 million in funding from Ireland, of which &euro;500,000 was ring-fenced for Rafah in Gaza. This year Ireland will provide a further &euro;2 million in funding to UNRWA, &euro;500,000 of which I have ear-marked for Gaza.</P>
        <P>Ireland also provides funding for projects in Gaza through the human rights and democratisation scheme. This year I allocated &euro;100,000 to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, PCHR, a Gaza city-based organisation which we have supported for the past number of years. The centre works to protect human rights and promote the rule of law, to create and develop democratic institutions and an active civil society.</P>
        <P>Funding of &euro;50,000 was also provided to the Palestinian Association for Education and Environmental Protection to run a summer school for young people from Gaza in non-violence, conflict resolution, democracy and leadership skills.</P><Col N="1738"/>
        <P>At an EU level, under the emergency municipalities support programme, the European Commission committed &euro;30 million in support of Gaza and the West Bank for institution and capacity building for programmes in the health sector. The European Commission has now committed new funding of &euro;40 million specifically to Gaza for an infrastructural financial facility aimed at developing infrastructure in Gaza. The facility is being co-ordinated with the Palestinian Authority and other donors and a number of projects relating to customs, transport, water and energy supply have already been identified.</P>

        <Quest>his views on reports that African refugees and immigrants were driven into the Sahara desert to their deaths by Moroccan authorities in mid-October 2005, especially in the wake of attempts by thousands of African refugees and immigrants to cross barrier fences into Spanish held EU territory (details supplied).</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Efforts by illegal migrants from sub-Saharan Africa to transit through Morocco in order to enter Spanish territory have been a growing problem for Spain and Morocco, and for the EU in general, in recent years. This situation poses significant difficulties for the States involved. Of equal concern are the serious risks to which the migrants expose themselves, as the method most often used has been by sea, on flimsy homemade rafts. As efforts have increased to tackle this problem larger numbers have tried to reach Spanish territory by travelling overland. Spain, and its partners in the EU, have been assisting and co-operating with the Moroccan authorities in an effort to tackle this serious illegal immigration issue.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of October this year, a very large number of people who had travelled to Morocco made concerted efforts to enter the Spanish territories of Ceuta and Melilla, seeking to overwhelm the frontier barriers rather than infiltrate them. The change in the tactics used, and the large numbers of people involved, created considerable difficulties for the Spanish and Moroccan authorities, who were not prepared for action on the scale experienced. In night-time clashes between the migrants and security forces from both countries, some 16 people were killed, and others wounded. The Moroccan authorities have investigated these tragic events. They have accepted that Moroccan security forces were responsible for some of the <Col N="1739"/>deaths, and the Moroccan Government has expressed its deep regret for the loss of life.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the reports to which the Deputy refers, that one group of some 500 of these migrants was transported to a desert area close to the Algerian border, without adequate arrangements for food, water and transport, and on the assumption that they would make their own way across the border into Algeria. The issue has been highlighted by several NGOs and was widely reported in the media. The Moroccan Government has undertaken to investigate the situation fully and to take whatever action is necessary in response to the details of the investigation. It has admitted that mistakes were made in the management of the problem, and has asked that they not be exploited for political reasons. My understanding is that the group of people involved were moved to a transit camp. While their exact status is not yet clear, it seems likely that some or all may have been among a large number of migrants flown back by the Moroccan authorities to their countries of origin in sub-Saharan Africa in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>While the EU is working to improve co-operation with Morocco in order to reduce the flow of illegal migrants, it is clearly essential that any measures taken must respect fully the human rights and dignity of the individuals concerned. Morocco is in full agreement with this position. It is obviously unacceptable that persons may have been left in the desert without adequate facilities, for whatever reason.</P>
        <P>It is right that failures of this kind should be highlighted and corrected. However, I believe it is only fair to acknowledge the pressure on the Moroccan authorities created by a problem which is not of their own making. It is estimated that there are some 10,000 migrants in Morocco, attempting to reach Spanish territory, and a further 20,000 in Algeria seeking to reach Morocco for the same purpose. Similar problems exist in other countries across North Africa.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach announced at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York on 14 September that the Government will reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012. We have agreed a number of steps along the way to achieving the target, including interim targets of 0.5% of GNP in 2007 and 0.6% in 2010. We have, therefore, a clear pathway to achieving the UN target in 2012. The precise allocation to the Department&rsquo;s Vote for International Co-operation, Vote 29, will be announced in the context of the Estimates. However, on the basis of current anticipated growth rates, total ODA, at 0.47% of GNP in 2006, is expected to be of the order of &euro;675 million.</P>
        <P>Over the next weeks and months, the Department will assess the staffing levels which will be required to manage a significantly expanded aid programme. The Deputy will be interested to know that ten new posts for the directorate were approved by the Department of Finance in November 2000, and a further 22 in February 2002. In addition, three staff from the former National Committee for Development Education and 17 staff of the former Agency for Personal Service Overseas were integrated into the directorate in 2003 and 2004, respectively.</P>
        <P>The following table indicates the number of new staff recruited by the Department and assigned to the development co-operation directorate over the past five years. It should be noted that a number of staff will also have left the directorate during this period. I am also providing a table indicating the number of consultants engaged by the directorate in each of the past five years.</P><Col N="1739"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
        <P>The wearing of foreign military uniforms in the State is governed by section 317 of the Defence Act 1954. The provisions of this section prohibit the wearing of a foreign military uniform without ministerial permission.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Defence Act 1954, express permission was granted by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="1742"/>in January 2003 to the US authorities for their military personnel to wear their uniforms in the transit areas of Irish airports. It was stipulated in an exchange of diplomatic notes with the US Embassy that, where it was sought to wear uniforms outside of the transit area, a further request would be required.</P>
        <P>The following table outlines the numbers of US troops passing through Shannon Airport during the period covered by the Deputies&rsquo; requests, which has been prepared on the basis of available information. Currently, monthly breakdowns are only available from the year 2002 onwards, and owing to difficulties in accessing earlier records in the time available, it was not possible to extract figures for the year 2000. Up until the end of October, there has been a total of 268,963 US troop movements through Shannon this year.</P>
        <P>Once the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been obtained, it is a matter for the US authorities whether their troops actually wear uniform when transiting through Shannon Airport. However, I understand that on flights transiting through Shannon, US military personnel usually wear their uniform.</P><Col N="1741"/>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2004, an EU-wide mid-term review of progress under the Lisbon Agenda was initiated. The outcome of this review was considered by the European Council at its meeting in March 2005. The European Council acknowledged that, five years after the launch of the Lisbon Agenda, the results were mixed. In this context, the European Council agreed to relaunch the Lisbon Agenda as a partnership for growth and employment.</P>
        <P>The Council also decided to promote action in two key complementary areas &mdash; social cohesion, with a focus on the major challenges we face in fighting poverty and disadvantage, and sustainable development. In the latter context, the European Council in June 2005 also adopted a set of guiding principles in order to help promote the integration of sustainable development into EU actions. Under this relaunched Lisbon Agenda, each member state is required to prepare, on its own responsibility, a three year national reform programme geared to its own specific needs and situation.</P>
        <P>Following consultation with the social partners and consideration by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government sent Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme to the European Commission on 28 October 2005. Our national reform programme draws heavily from the programme for Government and the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. It identifies the various priorities, policies and actions being pursued by us in order to deliver on the Lisbon Agenda.</P>
        <P>Overall, Ireland is performing well on many of the key Lisbon indicators. Our main goal for the next three years is to sustain and build on the progress of recent years. For its part, the European Commission will focus in on measures to be taken at the EU level to reinforce the programmes being undertaken by member states.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly supports the relaunched Lisbon Agenda. We believe in part<Col N="1744"/>icular that reform programmes in the member states, coupled with common action through the EU institutions, are essential to equip the European Union to face up to the competitive challenges of globalisation, including the rise of China, India and other emerging economies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 22 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in December 2003, the development co-operation directorate of the Department of Foreign Affairs, currently based in Dublin, is scheduled to decentralise to Limerick. This will involve the relocation to Limerick of 123 posts and is scheduled to take place during the first quarter of 2007.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 24 specialists based in the directorate&rsquo;s headquarters and 11 of these will be decentralising to Limerick. There are 12 senior development specialist positions based at the directorate&rsquo;s headquarters and, to date, two applications have been received for these positions through the central applications facility. I would hope that more will volunteer as we approach the decentralisation deadline.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
        <P>I am aware that the advisory board for Development Co-operation Ireland has expressed concerns about the possible negative impact of the proposed decentralisation on the <Col N="1745"/>Development Co-operation Ireland programme. My officials are engaging with the advisory board on a regular basis, updating it on progress in the decentralisation process and outlining our risk management strategies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 51 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The Government, and its partners in the EU, firmly believe that the Quartet roadmap provides the best framework for a lasting and peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We are continuing to work with Israel and with the Palestinian Authority to ensure that they take advantage of the opportunity offered by the dis<Col N="1746"/>engagement from Gaza for a return to full implementation of the roadmap. This will involve parallel action by both parties to implement their commitments under the roadmap.</P>
        <P>The Israeli Government has not made direct contact with the Government in relation to arrangements for the Egypt-Gaza border. On 2 November, the Quartet&rsquo;s Special Envoy for Disengagement, Mr. James Wolfensohn, wrote to the EU Presidency and to High Representative Solana to convey a request from the parties that the EU consider playing a third party monitoring role at the Rafah crossing point. The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council which I attended in Brussels on 7 November noted the EU&rsquo;s willingness in principle to provide assistance with the operation of crossings at Gaza&rsquo;s borders, on the basis of an agreement between the parties. An EU scoping mission is visiting the region this week and its report to the Council should provide the basis for an early decision on the nature of any EU involvement.</P>
        <P>The Council also considered the wider situation, including the recent escalation in violence in Gaza and the West Bank. It condemned unreservedly the recent terrorist attacks on Israel, which have resulted in a number of Israeli fatalities and injuries. The Council also condemned the further violence perpetrated by Palestinian militants. While recognising fully Israel&rsquo;s right to protect its citizens, the Council also considered the wider situation, including the recent escalation in violence in Gaza and the West Bank. It condemned unreservedly the recent terrorist attacks on Israel, which have resulted in a number of Israeli fatalities and injuries. The Council also condemned the further violence perpetrated by Palestinian militants. While recognising fully Israel&rsquo;s right to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks, the Council called on Israel to act with restraint and to refrain from all extra-judicial killings, which are contrary to international law. It underlined the need for the Palestinian Authority to take full control of law and order in the Occupied Territories.</P>
        <P>The EU regularly emphasises its firm commitment to the objective of the co-existence of two states. This must involve the creation of an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian state, living side by side with Israel and its neighbours in peace and security. The EU will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders other than those arrived at by agreement between the parties.</P>
        <P>The Council this week reiterated its support for the work of the Quartet Special Envoy for Disengagement, and welcomed his recent report on progress. It urged the parties to reach early agreement on the issues identified in the rapid action plan, including arrangements for Gaza&rsquo;s borders and crossings, the Gaza seaport and airport, <Col N="1747"/>movement of goods and people between Gaza and the West Bank, and freedom of movement in the West Bank. The Council called on Israel and the Palestinians to work with equal determination towards resolution of the outstanding issues.</P>
        <P>The Council urged the Israeli Government to cease all activities in the Palestinian territories, including settlement building, the construction of the separation barrier and the demolition of Palestinian homes, which are contrary to international law and threaten to make any solution based on the co-existence of two states physically impossible. Ministers were particularly concerned about the implementation of these policies in and around east Jerusalem. The Council called for the re-opening of Palestinian institutions in east Jerusalem, and it called on the Israeli Government to cease all discriminatory treatment of Palestinians in east Jerusalem.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 58 and 101 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is gravely concerned by the unrest and loss of life which have occurred in Addis Ababa and some other parts of Ethiopia since 1 November 2005. While order is gradually being restored, I understand that an estimated 48 people died during rioting last week, over 200 were injured. Reliable reports suggest that up to 20,000 people have been detained, including most of the leadership of the largest opposition party, the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, CUD, and some representatives of civil society and the media.</P>
        <P>I condemn all the acts of violence which have occurred, irrespective of their perpetrators. They must be independently investigated as soon as possible, as was promised recently by the Ethiop<Col N="1748"/>ian Prime Minister. The use of lethal force by the security forces must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. I urge both the Ethiopian Government and the opposition parties to exercise the utmost restraint and to act responsibly. The tragic events in Addis Ababa and other towns have further deepened the political and social divisions in the community, as well as damaging Ethiopia&rsquo;s international reputation.</P>
        <P>The random searches, indiscriminate beatings and massive arrests which have occurred must stop. All political detainees should be released. Individuals detained should be immediately released if not charged under due process. Their whereabouts should be notified; access to them should be granted for their families, legal counsel and representatives of the ICRC or other appropriate representatives of the international community; and they should be provided with medicines and humanitarian needs.</P>
        <P>On my instructions, Ireland&rsquo;s <i>charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires</i> in Addis Ababa is currently trying to ascertain the conditions under which those who have been detained are being held. We will receive further updates from him over coming days.</P>
        <P>We urgently call upon all political parties and the Ethiopian people to desist from further violence. They should pursue their political aims by exclusively peaceful democratic means. The resumption of political dialogue between the Ethiopian authorities and the opposition parties is essential if stability is to be restored. This dialogue must be based on principles of reconciliation, respect for the rule of law, human rights and democracy. The progress which Ethiopia has made in recent years towards a fully democratic future, and which is what its people clearly desire, must not be reversed.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a strong commitment to the poorest and most vulnerable people in Ethiopia and the Government is working to help them through its aid programme. This assistance is making a real difference to the lives of poor people in Ethiopia, including in the areas of basic health and education. Our aid programme is kept under constant review. In making any assessment and future decisions about Ireland&rsquo;s co-operation with Ethiopia, we will be guided by reports from the ground and by shared analysis with Ireland&rsquo;s EU partners.</P>
        <P>In a statement this week, Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, condemned the use of lethal force by the Ethiopian security forces and called for the correct treatment of detainees. This morning he called in the <i>charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires</i> at the Ethiopian Embassy, following an earlier meeting last week with departmental officials, to seek his Government&rsquo;s view of these disturbing events and convey the Government&rsquo;s concerns.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The UN World Summit held last September in New York agreed a balanced and extensive package of UN reforms. I was honoured to have contributed to the summit outcome in my role as one of the envoys appointed by Secretary General Annan to support his recommendations for change aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the UN. These changes must be implemented if today&rsquo;s common challenges in the areas of peace and security, development and human rights are to be overcome.</P>
        <P>I fully support Secretary General Annan and General Assembly President Eliasson of Sweden in this crucial implementation phase. At my instruction, Ireland&rsquo;s representation to the UN in New York is giving priority to UN reform in its work, especially as regards the peacebuilding commission, the human rights council and management reform. The peacebuilding commission, PBC, to be established by 31 December 2005, will assist countries emerging from conflicts so that they do not again fall prey to strife. I believe that negotiations in New York must focus on how the PBC will work in practice and in that regard I support the joint establishment of the body by both the General Assembly and the Security Council.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the human rights council is another priority for Ireland. While the summit agreed in principle to its establishment, much remains to be done on the detail of its mandate, functions, size and procedural issues. I believe that it should be a standing body, able to meet regularly throughout the year and to address effectively urgent and serious human rights violations as and when they occur. It should retain the best features of the Commission on Human Rights, especially the commission&rsquo;s engagement with civil society and its system of special procedures on country and thematic issues.</P>
        <P>Agreement on the concept of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity was an important achievement of the summit. The international community has said that it will act collectively, through the Security Council, where states fail to protect their own populations from such violations. This obligation must be given priority in the Security Council&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged that the Secretary General will continue his work of reforming the UN secretariat, especially on the issues of ethics, <Col N="1750"/>accountability and oversight, as mandated in the summit outcome document. I look forward to seeing further proposals from him in this area, including in response to the Volcker reports on the implementation of the Iraq oil for food programme.</P>
        <P>My delegation is working with others towards agreement on a Comprehensive Convention Against Terrorism at this session of the General Assembly. I look forward to the development of the UN counter-terrorism strategy and to proposals from the Secretary General to strengthen the capacity of the UN to assist states in combating terrorism.</P>
        <P>There are other issues which are not the focus of discussions currently under way in New York. These include the millennium development goals which are the joint responsibility of the donor and developing countries. The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach committed Ireland to reaching the UN target of 0.7% by 2012, which, on current levels, will mean a tripling of our development co-operation budget.</P>
        <P>I reiterate my disappointment that progress was not made on disarmament and non-proliferation at the summit. Ireland remains committed to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and we will continue to work to strengthen it.</P>
        <P>Many of these concerns are reflected in conclusions agreed at the meeting of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 November, which I attended. The Council reiterated the EU&rsquo;s deep commitment to the UN, to the upholding and development of international law and to effective multilateralism as a central element of its external action, and agreed on priorities in the implementation of the summit outcome to be pursued vigorously by EU delegations in New York.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 78, 95 and 139 together.</P>
        <P>The need to cope with the challenges of managing an enlarged Union of 25 or more members was one of the reasons for embarking on the process that led to the elaboration of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe.</P>
        <P>The position as regards the ratification of the European constitution is that a total of 13 countries might be described as having effectively ratified, either because they have approved the text by referendum or because their parliamentary procedures relating to ratification have been completed. A 14th has almost completed this procedure. Until the position at European level is clearer, it is not intended to set a date for a referendum in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As regards enlargement, following the signing of the accession treaty in April 2005, Bulgaria and Romania participate in almost all EU meetings as active observers and are scheduled to join the Union in January 2007, if they are ready. On 3 October, Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council gave the go-ahead to open accession negotiations with both Croatia and Turkey.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s annual monitoring reports for Bulgaria and Romania were published on 25 October 2005 and provide a comprehensive overview of the progress made by both countries towards fulfilling the requirements of membership. For both countries, a number of &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; issues have been identified that will need to be urgently addressed before the date of accession. The Commission will closely monitor the steps taken to tackle these issues and will present a final recommendation to Council in April-May 2006 as to whether Bulgaria and Romania will be in a position to meet the full requirements of membership by 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P>I believe it is essential that both countries make full use of the period between now and the spring European Council to address the issues highlighted by the Commission so as to ensure that they remain on track to join the Union, as envisaged, in 2007. This is in the best interests of the Union and of the acceding countries themselves.</P>
        <P>As regards Croatia and Turkey, the European Commission will undertake an intensive screening process, evaluating the degree of preparedness of both countries with a view to setting benchmarks for the opening and closure of negotiation chapters. The Commission also published its annual progress reports for Turkey and Croatia on 9 November, providing a timely overview of the current state of play in both countries.</P><Col N="1752"/>
        <P>Negotiations will proceed with both countries on the basis of their own merits. This means that the pace of negotiation will be determined by each country&rsquo;s progress towards meeting the requirements of EU membership. According to the agreed negotiating frameworks, the shared objective of the negotiations &mdash; an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand &mdash; is accession. In the case of Turkey, we anticipate that the negotiations will continue for a considerable length of time. Turkey&rsquo;s accession could have substantial financial consequences and the conclusions adopted on 3 October indicate that the negotiations can only be concluded after the establishment of the Union&rsquo;s financial framework for the period from 2014. The Union&rsquo;s capacity to absorb Turkey will also be an important consideration in the general interest of both the Union and Turkey. The Commission will continue to monitor this capacity as the negotiations proceed.</P>
        <P>The interdepartmental committee on enlargement will be convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs to monitor developments and co-ordinate Ireland&rsquo;s approach to EU enlargement and especially the forthcoming negotiations with both Croatia and Turkey.</P>
        <P>Ireland continues to provide assistance and advice to Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Turkey as part of the Department of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; bilateral assistance programme, which is designed to help new and candidate member states prepare for the challenges of EU membership.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 30 together.</P>
        <P>In a statement I made on Monday, 24 October to mark the tenth anniversary of Aung San Suu Kyi&rsquo;s detention under house arrest, I reiterated <Col N="1753"/>Ireland&rsquo;s clear position on Burma. Together with our EU partners we condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy. Our goal remains an end to human rights violations there, the release and restoration of liberty to Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and the realisation of democracy, peace and prosperity for the long suffering people of Burma.</P>
        <P>In my statement on behalf of Ireland to the 60th session of the UN General Assembly in September, I likewise referred to the continuing denial of human rights and democracy in Burma. I stated that this was most acutely symbolised by the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and that her ordeal was not forgotten by the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the report, Threat to the Peace: A Call for the UN Security Council to Act in Burma, which was commissioned by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa and published in September. While I am not aware of any plans by the UN Security Council to consider the question of Burma, we would be very pleased if this were to occur. Ireland will use all relevant opportunities to press for the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative, Mr. Razali Ismail, and the Special Rapporteur on the situation on Human Rights in Burma, Mr Sergio Pinheiro, to be allowed to visit and to meet all the key players in Burma.</P>
        <P>At both ministerial and official level, we maintain regular dialogue with those concerned with the situation in Burma. Last month, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met with a delegation from the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and associated groups, accompanied by representatives of Burma Action Ireland. In March I met with Harn Yawnghwe, Director of the European Office for the Development of Democracy in Burma, and Burma Action Ireland.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputies that I will continue to highlight the plight of the Burmese people on all possible occasions and to work for real progress in Burma.</P>

        <Quest>the number of outstanding judgments, findings or infringement proceedings against Ireland for the failure or delay to transpose European Union regulations into Irish law or to act on applicable European directives or legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The obligation on member states to transpose EU <Col N="1754"/>legislation relates to EU directives. EU regulations do not need to be transposed, as they are directly applicable.</P>
        <P>If the EU Commission considers that a member state has failed to fulfil an obligation, such as failure to transpose a directive or incorrectly transposing a directive, it can &mdash; under Article 226 of the treaty &mdash; issue a reasoned opinion on the matter. If the member state concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission, the Commission may bring the matter before the European Court of Justice. Where such an action is taken against a member state under Article 226, and the infringement in question is not addressed, the Commission will bring an action under Article 228 seeking fines against the member state in question.</P>
        <P>At present, Ireland has no outstanding judgments, findings or infringements against it for the failure to transpose, or delay in transposing, EU directives into Irish law, or failure to act on applicable directives. There are, however, 24 infringement proceedings against Ireland under Article 226 for alleged incorrect transposition of EU directives. In five of these cases, a judgment has already been made, and Ireland must now comply with these judgments. In addition, there are five cases at the Article 228 stage.</P>
        <P>The Government takes all infringement cases against Ireland very seriously and has put in place structures and procedures to ensure that all such proceedings are dealt with properly and effectively.</P>

        <Quest>the position with regard to the role of the European Union in maintaining the security situation in Kosovo and in improving human rights and protections throughout the region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU has given a clear commitment that the long-term future of the western Balkans, including Kosovo, rests within the European Union. The Union has taken a lead role in working to consolidate peace and stability and to promote economic development, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the region.</P>
        <P>Kosovo has been under UN administration, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1244, since the end of the conflict in 1999. Responsibility for the security situation is primarily a matter for KFOR, the UN-mandated peacekeeping force, to which 35 states, including 22 EU member states, currently contribute troops. I pay tribute to the work of KFOR and especially to the contribution of the 202 members of the Irish <Col N="1755"/>Defence Forces serving with the force in ensuring security and stability in often difficult circumstances.</P>
        <P>Consideration of the future status of Kosovo is expected to be the dominant issue in the region in the coming months following the publication last month of UN Special Envoy, Kai Eide&rsquo;s, comprehensive review of the situation there. Ambassador Eide&rsquo;s report recommended that despite a number of challenges, particularly with regard to the implementation of standards, the political process to determine Kosovo&rsquo;s future status should now begin.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, reaffirmed the EU&rsquo;s determination to participate fully in the definition of the status of Kosovo, and to be closely involved in the negotiations and implementation of its future status. In this context, I welcome the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s intention to appoint the former President of Finland, Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, as UN Special Envoy. Together with EU colleagues, I had a good discussion with Mr. Ahtisaari on Monday and look forward to working closely with him in the period ahead. In view of the likelihood of enhanced EU engagement in Kosovo, the Council has invited Secretary-General/High Representative Solana and the Commission to continue their work in identifying the future EU role and contribution, including in the areas of police, rule of law and the economy, and to submit joint proposals to the Council.</P>
        <P>In the period ahead, together with our EU partners, we will continue to work in close co-operation with the United Nations, with the governments of the region, the US and other international partners towards a status settlement in Kosovo. The future status settlement should be fully compatible with European values and the UN charter, should protect the rights of minorities and their capacity to play a part in political structures, and achieve a situation where all citizens, regardless of ethnic background, are free to live without fear, hostility or danger.</P>

        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s views on the recent issue of indictments by the International Criminal Court in the case of participants in the conflict in Northern Uganda; the response of the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army; the action the European Union and the United Nations proposes to take and the circumstances which have forced the humanitarian aid agency GOAL to suspend its operations after 22 years in Northern Uganda due to the deteriorating security situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The International Criminal Court issued indictments on 13 October 2005 for the arrest of five Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, LRA, commanders, including the LRA leader, Joseph Kony. This represents a historic development for the court and it is now incumbent on all those involved, including any neighbouring states in which the LRA leaders concerned may be sheltering, to facilitate the arrest of the individuals now indicted. The Government is strongly supportive of the International Criminal Court and would urge that its investigation into all serious violations of human rights committed in Northern Uganda since 1 July 2002, the date of establishment of the ICC, should continue.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, meeting in Brussels on 7 November, reiterated its concern at the continuing conflict in Northern Uganda which has left more than 1.4 million people living in camps for internally displaced persons. The Council also expressed grave concern at the deteriorating security situation and the recent upsurge in attacks in Northern Uganda which forced the UN and NGOs such as GOAL to suspend their humanitarian operations, though I understand that the UN has now resumed deliveries of humanitarian aid. The primary responsibility for improving security in Northern Uganda rests with the Ugandan Government and the Council has called clearly on the Ugandan Government in this respect to ensure urgently that all of its citizens are protected and provided for.</P>
        <P>The EU, for its part, stands ready to provide further assistance to the humanitarian effort and to do what it can to support steps towards reconciliation in Northern Uganda. Ireland has provided humanitarian assistance of &euro;650,000 to date in 2005 to address the humanitarian situation and provision of further assistance for Irish NGOs operating in the region is under active consideration.</P>
        <P>The Government, together with our EU partners, will also continue to urge the Ugandan Government to pursue all efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Northern Uganda and to promote the much needed economic and social development of the region. This includes co-operating more closely with neighbouring states to ensure that those indicted by the ICC are now apprehended. It also involves greater efforts by Uganda to promote regional confidence and security, including through full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries within the Great Lakes region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 50, 62, 64, 90 and 137 together.</P>
        <P>The earthquake which struck south Asia, particularly Pakistan, on 8 October has had devastating consequences. The unusual shallow nature of the quake caused widespread structural damage and current estimates put the dead at over 70,000, including 17,000 children. It has been followed by some 900 aftershocks, one of which recently measured over six on the Richter scale.</P>
        <P>Following the disaster, the Taoiseach wrote both to the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. Shaukat Aziz, and the Prime Minster of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, to express condolences on behalf of the Government and to assure them that Ireland is ready to provide aid to those affected by the earthquake.</P>
        <P>President McAleese wrote to President Musharraf of Pakistan and President Dr. Abdul Kalam <Col N="1758"/>of India to express her sympathies, and those of the Irish people, to the Governments and peoples affected by the tragedy.</P>
        <P>As Minister with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, I have remained in contact with the ambassador of Pakistan to Ireland, H.E. Mr. Toheed Ahmad, in the weeks following the disaster. I have also been in close contact with our key NGO partners and with the Pakistani community in Ireland, which has responded with enormous generosity to this appalling tragedy. Officials from my Department and in missions abroad are in close contact with UN agencies, the International Federation of the Red Cross and NGOs on the ground regarding the situation there.</P>
        <P>Ireland was among the first countries to respond to the disaster. Within a few hours of the earthquake, &euro;1 million was pledged towards immediate relief efforts in northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions. As the casualty figures rose dramatically, our response was increased to &euro;5 million, placing Ireland as one of the highest donors to the disaster on a <i>per capita</i> basis. Ireland&rsquo;s rapid contribution has been warmly and broadly welcomed.</P>
        <P>The updated UN Flash Appeal for the region has called for nearly $550 million in funding for immediate relief needs. A little over &euro;130 million has been pledged to date. Some of the pledges made by donors have yet to materialise into confirmed contributions. Even if all the pledges are confirmed, that still leaves a very considerable shortfall. I support President Musharraf&rsquo;s call for more generous assistance, specifically from Islamic, EU and OECD states. I am pleased to report to the House that Ireland&rsquo;s pledge to the disaster has been fully committed. It is essential that pledges are honoured so that vital assistance can be delivered to save lives.</P>
        <P>Approximately &euro;1.5 million of our assistance has been allocated to key UN humanitarian agencies, including UNICEF and the World Food Programme, WFP. Over &euro;2.5 million has been allocated to non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Concern, GOAL, Oxfam, Plan Ireland and Tr&oacute;caire, which are active in the provision of essential services on the ground. These services include the provision of food, health services, shelter, water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>The disaster is, logistically, one of the toughest challenges faced by the UN and the international community. Some 15,000 villages were affected and many are in areas which are difficult to reach. We are continually monitoring the situation in the region and officials from my Department will conduct a mission to the areas affected to meet with our partners on the ground and to assess the situation at first hand.</P>
        <P>Our key objective is to save lives. In the longer term, we will assist with restoring livelihoods and working towards recovery. As I have told the <Col N="1759"/>House during the recent special debate on the south Asia earthquake, Ireland will continue its support for the victims of this humanitarian disaster through the long recovery period that lies ahead. While the immediate focus remains on emergency relief, Ireland will be represented at the forthcoming reconstruction conference which will be convened by the Government of Pakistan on 19 November in Islamabad.</P>
        <P>The number and scale of natural disasters this year reinforce the need for global resources to be mobilised and deployed rapidly to bring humanitarian relief on a large scale to anywhere in the world. Ireland has been actively focusing on how we can better respond to such emergencies. Internationally, Ireland supports the enhancement of the UN&rsquo;s central emergency relief fund and I have pledged &euro;10 million to that end. This will create a new grant-based fund that will allow UN <Col N="1760"/>agencies to respond more immediately and effectively in the face of a sudden on-set disaster.</P>
        <P>Work is also continuing at EU level to improve civil protection and rapid response capability through the tsunami follow-up action plan. The further development of rapid response capacity must complement and support the UN&rsquo;s primary role as co-ordinator in humanitarian disasters. At the national level, we are examining ways in which the Government&rsquo;s response to disasters and emergencies can be enhanced through a more operational role.</P>
        <P>On the contribution of other donors, the UN financial tracking system maintains information on donors&rsquo; contributions to UN appeals and more broadly on donors&rsquo; contributions to particular emergencies. According to the information available to my Department on the south Asia earthquake, the <i>per capita</i> donor contribution to date is set out in the following table.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>the Government&rsquo;s position on the increase of sales of armaments, often into the poorest countries by member states of the European Union; and the position being adopted by the Government towards the increase in the proportion of armaments globally that are sold by the European Union and individual countries within the EU.</Quest>
        <QRef>[33491/05]</QRef><Col N="1760"/>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The regulation of arms exports is legally a matter for national authorities, subject to internationally agreed restrictions, such as all EU, OSCE and UN arms embargoes. The Government does not have access to information on the precise details on armaments contracts made by other EU member states.</P>
        <P>However, the promotion and support of international efforts to secure appropriate safeguards on the sale and transfer of armaments is a key <Col N="1761"/>priority of Irish foreign policy. There is a need to end destabilising accumulations of arms that can increase the potential for violence in areas of tension. There are too many examples of conflicts which are fuelled by the proliferation of conventional weapons. This is especially an issue of concern in Africa, where the proliferation in particular of small arms and light weapons continues to bring much suffering to societies throughout that continent.</P>
        <P>At present, the export of all arms from EU countries must also conform to the EU code of conduct on arms exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods. These include respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. Discussions are ongoing in the EU on the possible reinforcement of the code of conduct.</P>
        <P>In particular, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to criterion 8 of the EU code of conduct, which provides that member states in authorising sales of armaments should consider, &ldquo;The compatibility of the arms exports with the technical and economic capacity of the recipient country, taking into account the desirability that states should achieve their legitimate needs of security and defence with the least diversion for armaments of human and economic resources.&rdquo; A set of best practices for interpretation of this criterion has been recently agreed within the EU and work is underway to develop similar guidelines for other criteria of the code.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 November endorsed a strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition. The text contains an action plan which will be regularly reviewed and updated every six months. This strategy will be presented for adoption to the European Council next month.</P>

        <Quest>the number of staff who have been recruited in each of the past ten years; the projected numbers for the next five years; and the number of staff suggested by reports commissioned by his Department or the advisory committee on development co-operation in the staffing needs of Development Co-operation Ireland.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am presuming that the Deputy&rsquo;s question relates in its entirety to the staffing of the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation directorate.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach announced at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York on 14 September that the Government will reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012. We have agreed a number of steps along the way to achieving the target, including interim targets of 0.5% of GNP in 2007 and 0.6% in 2010. We have, therefore, a clear pathway to achieving the UN target in 2012. The precise allocation to the Department&rsquo;s Vote for International Co-operation, Vote 29, will be announced in the context of the Estimates. However, on the basis of current anticipated growth rates, total ODA, at 0.47% of GNP in 2006, is expected to be of the order of &euro;675 million.</P>
        <P>Over the next weeks and months, the Department will assess the staffing levels which will be required to manage a significantly expanded aid programme. In this context, regard will be had to the staffing levels recommended by the Ireland Aid Review Committee, and by an outside consultant, which latter study was commissioned by the Advisory Committee to Development Co-operation Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be interested to know that ten new posts for the directorate were approved by the Department of Finance in November 2000, and a further 22 in February 2002. In addition, three staff from the former National Committee for Development Education and 17 staff of the former Agency for Personal Service Overseas were integrated into the directorate in 2003 and 2004 respectively.</P>
        <P>The following table indicates the number of new staff recruited by the Department and assigned to the directorate over the past six years. It should be noted that a number of staff will also have left the directorate during this period. Unfortunately, it was not possible to assemble recruitment data for the preceding four years in the time available. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 94 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>At its most recent meeting, on 7 November 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council discussed the need for intensified support for the peace process in Colombia in line with the conclusions on Colombia it adopted on 3 October 2005. It was agreed in the conclusions adopted at the meeting on 3 October that the recently adopted Justice and Peace Law, if effectively and transparently implemented, will make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia. It is important that the Colombian Government is now encouraged and supported by the international community in its efforts to implement the Justice and Peace Law effectively. The law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society.</P>
        <P>The Justice and Peace Law is an important development in the implementation of Plan Colombia, the Colombian Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to bring peace to Colombia. That Government has the support of the Union in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict. EU funding for the peace process in Colombia is focused on helping end violence and human rights violations, relieving the social impact of conflict and the establishment of initiatives which encourage the broad participation of citizens in the search for peace. In light of Council discussions, the Commission will be developing further proposals to support the peace process. The situation in Colombia is undoubtedly complex and involves difficult choices and compromises. Nonetheless, the overall view of the Union is that it should remain positively engaged with the peace process.</P>
        <P>The Council conclusions adopted on 3 October also welcomed the continued involvement of the Organisation of American States, OAS, in supporting the demobilisation of paramilitary groups in Colombia. Ireland has committed &euro;390,000 over a three year period to the OAS mission to support and verify the peace process in Colombia. Sweden and The Netherlands also provide funding to the OAS mission. Its mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process with a focus both on the demobilisation process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law.</P><Col N="1765"/>
        <P>I am aware of the deaths of community leader Diego Gutierrez and lawyer Luis Ignacio Aristiz&aacute;bel Botero referred to in the questions. Mr. Gutierrez was allegedly killed by right-wing paramilitaries. Mr. Aristiz&aacute;bel Botero, who was investigating drug trafficking and paramilitary activity, was reportedly shot by a group of armed men in Medell&iacute;n. It is disturbing that, despite the peace process in Colombia which has seen many thousands hand in their weapons, there continue to be credible allegations that paramilitaries remain involved in this type of action.</P>
        <P>Ireland was actively involved in negotiating the chairperson&rsquo;s statement on the situation of human rights in Colombia which was adopted on 22 April 2005 at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The statement deplored the fact that human rights defenders, including trade unionists and judicial officers, continue to be particularly affected by the armed conflict, and to be the victims of homicides and threats by the illegal armed groups. The statement also urged that dialogue and negotiations be pursued between the Government of Colombia and all illegal armed groups, aimed at overcoming the situation of violence stemming from the conflict and at reaching a lasting peace.</P>
        <P>The hunger strike of a number of trade unionists in the city of Cartagena concerns a union protest over the decision of the Colombian Government to sell some of its stock in a petrol refinery, apparently in order to raise funding for its further development. I understand that the parties involved are now engaged in a dialogue aimed at resolving their differences.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the European Council in June 2005 failed to reach agreement on the future financial perspectives. While the great majority of member states could accept the Luxembourg Presidency&rsquo;s final compromise package of 17 June, a small number of countries remained opposed for a variety of reasons. These included the proposed reduction of the UK rebate, the level of net contributions and funding for cohesion.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach indicated at the European Council that, in the interests of solidarity, Ireland could accept the Luxembourg Presidency&rsquo;s final proposal. Throughout the negotiations, Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental objective has been to ensure that the enlarged Union is equipped with the necessary financial resources to enable it to meet the chal<Col N="1766"/>lenges of the years ahead and the rightful expectations of our citizens. Ireland&rsquo;s particular priorities in the negotiations include safeguarding the October 2002 agreement on the funding of the Common Agricultural Policy, ensuring adequate cohesion arrangements for our regions in transition, putting in place equitable financing arrangements for the Union and achieving increased funding for competitiveness, especially in the area of research and development.</P>
        <P>At Monday&rsquo;s meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels, member states held their first detailed discussion of the dossier at political level since June. I am pleased to report that all member states, Ireland included, attach urgency to achieving political agreement on the future financial framework at next month&rsquo;s European Council. It is clear, however, that considerable work needs to be done at Council level if we are to overcome the divisions that still exist among member states. Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the current phase of the negotiations are unchanged. We also consider that the basis for agreement in December must be the package that was on the table in June. This is also the position of a clear majority of member states.</P>
        <P>The Presidency is aiming to secure agreement on the dossier at the European Council meeting on 16-17 December. We will do everything possible, consistent with our stated priorities, to secure early agreement in the interests of the enlarged Union and its citizens.</P>

	<P>On 31 October, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1636, welcoming the report of the UN International Investigation Commission into the assassination of the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Rafiq Hariri, in Beirut on 14 February 2005. The commission, under the German investigator, Mr. Detlev Mehlis, submitted an interim report on 19 October which indicated that major lines of inquiry pointed to the involvement of senior Lebanese and Syrian officials in the murder. The report stated that Syrian officials had not been fully co-operative with the inquiry, and had, indeed, attempted to mislead it.</P>
        <P>Security Council Resolution 1636 notes that serious questions remain to be answered by the Syrian authorities and requires that Syria extend full co-operation to the inquiry. The mandate of the commission has been extended to 15 <Col N="1767"/>December 2005. The resolution requests the commission of inquiry to make a further report to the Security Council by 15 December on issues, including the level of co-operation by the Syrian authorities, so that the Council can, if necessary, consider further action.</P>
        <P>While some Security Council members have made known their views on possible sanctions against Syria, there has been no such decision by the Security Council. Syria has denied involvement in the murder of Mr. Hariri, has pledged full co-operation with the investigation and has established its own internal inquiry. The Government, and our partners in the EU, believe it is essential that Syria acts immediately on its stated intention to co-operate with the investigation. We hope that when the commission reports to the Security Council in mid-December, it will be in a position to state that Syria has co-operated fully so that those responsible for the assassination can be brought to justice.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Terrorism is recognised as a major threat to the security of the European Union and of its citizens. Terrorism puts lives at risk. It imposes large costs. It seeks to undermine the openness and tolerance of European societies. It poses a strategic threat to the whole of Europe. The European Union is determined to take all necessary actions to counter the terrorist threat. The fight against terrorism therefore constitutes a priority objective for its member states.</P>
        <P>Ireland has played a significant role in shaping the Union&rsquo;s reaction to terrorist outrages. Ireland held the EU Presidency at the time of the Madrid bombings in March 2004. Its co-ordination of the Union response led to the adoption of two documents that still shape and direct the Union&rsquo;s response to terrorism, the European Union Dec<Col N="1769"/>laration on Combating Terrorism and the Revised EU Action Plan on Combating Terrorism. The action plan contains seven strategic objectives and is comprised of some 170 individual actions covering all aspects, both external and internal, of the Union&rsquo;s activities. An EU counter-terrorism co-ordinator was appointed to drive forward implementation of the action plan, which was revised in June 2005.</P>
        <P>As far as the EU&rsquo;s external relations are concerned, its principal aim on terrorism is to deepen the international consensus and enhance international efforts to combat it. In so doing the EU closely supports the efforts of the United Nations. It collaborates closely with the relevant Security Council committees and the terrorism prevention branch of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. The EU promotes the ratification of the existing conventions relating to international terrorism. Along with other EU Foreign Ministers, I recently signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland, the International Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The EU is currently involved in very sensitive negotiations at the UN General Assembly towards the conclusion of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism, which would include an agreed definition of terrorism.</P>
        <P>The EU maintains a close collaboration with the United States on this issue. The scope of co-operation is set out in the Dromoland Castle Declaration of June 2004 and covers such areas as the financing of terrorism, increased police, judicial and security co-operation, international transport safety and border controls, dealing with the consequences of terrorist attacks, recruitment to terrorism and enhancing the ability of vulnerable states and third countries to meet terrorist attacks.</P>
        <P>The fight against terrorism is a major priority of the Justice and Home Affairs Council. The adoption of anti-terrorist measures is dealt with extensively in the Hague programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union which was endorsed by the European Council in November 2004.</P>
        <P>Over the past 18 months, much has been achieved as regards internal aspects of the declaration and the action plan. Transport security has been improved. Europol and Eurojust have provided effective support in combating terrorism. All 25 member states have had their counter terrorism arrangements evaluated and a strategy for tackling radicalisation and recruitment is in development.</P>
        <P>A number of legislative measures have been adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council in this area, including a framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism. Ongoing work in the Council includes negotiations on a European evidence warrant as well as proposals relat<Col N="1770"/>ing to the exchange of information between law enforcement authorities.</P>
        <P>Following the London bombings on 7 July 2005, the Justice and Home Ministers met in a special session on 13 July and unanimously agreed a declaration that brought forward deadlines in the action plan on terrorism, identified four themes for future action and accelerated the Commission&rsquo;s programme of work. Furthermore, member states made new proposals to combat the terrorist threat. The measures agreed by the 13 July Council reflect four key policy objectives: the need to pursue and investigate terrorists across borders; the need to prevent people turning to terrorism; the need to protect citizens and infrastructure from terrorist attacks; and the need to prepare ourselves to manage and minimise the consequences of a terrorist attack. It is expected that the Council will agree an updated counter-terrorism framework in the coming months.</P>

	<P>I know that everyone in this House was delighted by the release of Mr. Rory Carroll and shared the enormous sense of relief felt by all people in Ireland. I pay tribute to the dignity and composure of the Carroll family throughout their whole ordeal.</P>
        <P>I wish also to record the Government&rsquo;s appreciation to all who helped achieve this happy outcome. In particular, throughout the ordeal, we maintained the closest contact with three EU partners, Britain, France and Italy, whose co-operation, both in their capitals and on the ground in Baghdad, was quite outstanding. In addition, the interim Iraqi Government and the Iranian authorities were helpful. I also thank the Muslim community here in Dublin for their concern and support. Finally, I thank most sincerely the Opposition parties for their understanding and co-operation throughout.</P>
        <P>Throughout the 36 hours that Mr. Carroll was abducted, the Government used every opportunity to emphasise his Irishness. To cover all eventualities, the Taoiseach and I decided, based on professional advice from Baghdad, to put an Irish team on the ground in Iraq, led by a senior ambassador and including Garda and Defence Force personnel. We believed that it was vital to have our people on the spot to ensure our direct input into discussions and decision making there. The team would, of course, have remained in constant contact with the Government here, and would have sent their assessments back to us for decision at political level here, in consultation <Col N="1771"/>with the Carroll family. The EU maintains a close collaboration with the United States on this issue. The scope of co-operation is set out in the Dromoland Castle Declaration of June 2004 and covers such areas as the financing of terrorism, increased police, judicial and security co-operation, international transport safety and border controls, dealing with the consequences of terrorist attacks, recruitment to terrorism and enhancing the ability of vulnerable states and third countries to meet terrorist attacks.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 71 together.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach announced at the UN Millennium Review Summit in New York on 14 September that the Government will reach the target of spending 0.7% of GNP on official development assistance by 2012.</P>
        <P>We have agreed a number of steps along the way to achieving the target. First, we have an interim target of 0.5% of GNP in 2007. Second, aid spending is expected to reach 0.6% in 2010. We have, then, a clear pathway to achieving the UN target in 2012. As the Deputies will be aware, 2012 was my own stated preference year for the achievement of the 0.7% of GNP figure.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Estimates process is currently under way and the allocations to the Department&rsquo;s Vote for International Co-operation, Vote 29, will be agreed in the context of the Estimates negotiations. On the basis of current anticipated growth rates, however, total ODA, at 0.47% of GNP in 2006, is expected to be of the order of &euro;675 million.</P>
        <P>My view on legislation on the 0.7% target is on record. I am not convinced that legislation is the answer. This would create a precedent which could be invoked for many areas of Government expenditure. Moreover, we have clearly charted the way forward, including through interim targets. Our commitment is achievable, and it will emphatically be achieved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>The allegation that there is or has been a network of secret prisons in Europe is a matter of very deep concern. The existence of such secret prisons would plainly be in breach of international law and of the principles upon which the EU is founded: liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law.</P>
        <P>The authors of the article which broke this story declined to identify the European states that were alleged to host these facilities. A US-based NGO subsequently named two European states, both of which strongly denied their participation in this alleged network.</P>
        <P>I have instructed my officials to monitor closely any further developments in this area, including the outcome of any inquires by the European Commission or any other international body.</P>
        <P>The Government has on several occasions made clear to the US authorities that it would be illegal to transit prisoners for rendition purposes through Irish territory without the express permission of the Irish authorities, acting in accordance with Irish and international law. The US authorities, for their part, have confirmed that they have not done so and that they would not do so without seeking the permission of the Irish authorities. No request for such authorisation has been received from the US authorities.</P>
        <P>If any citizen or other person has specific evidence that Shannon Airport or any other Irish airport is being used to transit prisoners for rendition purposes, I would reiterate the suggestion in my reply of 6 October, which has also been made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that this evidence be shared with the Garda authorities who would be responsible for investigating such matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In line with UN Security Council Resolutions 541 of 1983 and 550 of 1984, which are binding on all <Col N="1774"/>members of the United Nations, Ireland does not recognise the so-called &ldquo;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&rdquo;. The Republic of Cyprus has been a member state of the EU since 1 May 2004. In the absence of a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem, the application of the laws and regulations of the Union to the northern part of the island is suspended. The issue of property rights is a crucial element in the search for a comprehensive settlement, on which the United Nations has the lead role, and will not be resolved until such a comprehensive settlement has been agreed.</P>
        <P>Any Irish citizen considering the purchase of property in the area in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control should consider very carefully all the complex legal issues involved. It is important also to take full account of the political background. Any future comprehensive settlement in Cyprus will certainly include provisions on property rights which, depending on the particular circumstances, could have very serious practical or financial implications for people who have purchased property in the northern part of the island.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions 45 and 80 together.</P>
        <P>The situation in Iraq so far this year has been characterised by real progress in the political reconstruction of the country. This has, unfortunately, been accompanied by a continuing campaign of serious violence, aimed principally at the new Iraqi Government and its officials, and also at ordinary Iraqi civilians. The violence continues to hamper the restoration of effective administration in Iraq, and the process of physical and economic reconstruction.</P>
        <P>The new constitution of Iraq was approved in a national referendum on 15 October. Some 63% of the electorate turned out to vote. The Independent Electoral Commission for Iraq has reported that, overall, 79% voted in favour of adoption and 21% against. Fresh elections for a fully sovereign Iraqi assembly and government will be organised under the constitution, on 15 December. In principle, this will represent the completion of the process of political reconstruc<Col N="1775"/>tion set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1546 of June 2004.</P>
        <P>While the constitution was approved democratically by the Iraqi people, it is clear that the minority Sunni community voted heavily against it, although not in sufficient numbers to trigger the blocking mechanism of a two thirds negative vote in three provinces. The result highlights the continuing divisions in Iraqi society, which the new authorities must continue to work to overcome. In a positive development, however, the parties representing the Sunni community have decided to contest the December election. It is important that provision has been made for a short period of review for the new constitution, once the new assembly has been elected, in order to allow for attempts to address Sunni concerns.</P>
        <P>Despite the political progress, the level of violence in Iraq continues to be a cause of grave concern. There are frequent attacks on Iraqi officials and security forces, designed to prevent the Iraqi Government establishing effective administration and public services. Attacks are also regularly perpetrated against civilians from all communities, with the aim of causing maximum loss of life, and of fomenting division and provoking retaliation and civil strife.</P>
        <P>The Government, and our EU partners, will continue to support the Iraqi people as they work to rebuild their country after decades of dictatorship and war. The EU will maintain its assistance to the Iraqi authorities. This will include important assistance in organising the December elections and both technical and financial assistance for reconstructing the administration and economy of Iraq.</P>
        <P>My Department has maintained regular contact on Iraq with the International Committee of the Red Cross, principally through our permanent mission in Geneva. The issues involved include the welfare of civilians caught up in zones of conflict in Iraq and the conditions of detention of prisoners in Iraq.</P>

	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 46, 60, 87 and 140 together.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on the European Constitution, which was published on 13 October, is designed to give a fair and factual description of the constitution and an outline of the broad approach taken by Ireland to its negotiation. It has been widely distributed, including to schools, libraries, public representatives, and voluntary and non-governmental organisations. It is available to the public without charge on request from my Department and from the website <i>www.europeanconstitution.ie.</i> The issues the constitution addresses are directly relevant to Ireland and the EU as a whole and notwithstanding that the ratification process has been delayed, we have published the White Paper as a contribution to public information as part of the period of reflection.</P>
        <P>The period of reflection was agreed by the June European Council in the wake of the French and Dutch referendum results in order to allow a debate take place in each country involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties. As a contribution to this wider national debate, there will be a D&aacute;il debate on Europe and the Constitution on 23 November which will provide an opportunity for the White Paper to be discussed.</P>
        <P>At the EU level, Ministers for European Affairs had a discussion in Brussels on Monday 7 November at which they exchanged views about the conduct of the national debates across the Union. The Heads of State and Government agreed at last June&rsquo;s European Council to return to the issue of the constitution in the first half of 2006 when they will make an overall assessment of the national debates and agree on how to proceed. It is important to let this process take its course. Until the position at European level becomes clearer, it is not intended to set a date for a referendum in Ireland. A similar approach has been adopted by those other member states which intend to ratify the constitution by referendum.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 48 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>The North-South Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in Nairobi on 9 January 2005 was a major step forward, providing new hope for the future of Sudan. A new Government of National Unity was established in July, when the new constitution came into effect. Following the accidental death in a plane crash of First Vice-President and southern leader Dr. John Garang in July 2005, Cdr. Salva Kiir Mayardit was appointed to replace him. Both he and President Bashir have reiterated their determination to ensure the successful implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Formation of the Government of National Unity was completed in September. The interim constitution for south Sudan has also been finalised and an autonomous regional Government for South Sudan was formed on 22 October.</P>
        <P>While the political context is still very sensitive, overall significant progress is being made towards establishing stability. However, the challenges of the humanitarian situation in south Sudan remain enormous.</P>
        <P>While progress has been made in the north-south context, I am afraid that the political and humanitarian situation in the Darfur region remains a matter of the deepest concern. I conveyed this concern to the Sudanese Acting Foreign Minister when I met him in September in New York. More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes, including 200,000 who have crossed into Chad, as a result of the conflict in Darfur. These highly vulnerable populations are currently located in IDP and refugee camps.</P>
        <P>Sustained international pressure needs to be exerted on all the parties to honour their commitments, improve the security situation and achieve <Col N="1778"/>a speedy political settlement. Ireland fully supports the African Union-mediated peace talks in Abuja, Nigeria which are due to resume on 21 November. Little progress was made at the last round of talks held in October due to a split in the SLM-A rebel group, which the international community is currently working hard to resolve. The aim is to have all parties fully represented at a high level when the talks resume, and press them to commit themselves to finding a just and lasting peace settlement for Darfur before the end of 2005. I urge all parties to meet this objective.</P>
        <P>The Government fully supports the African Union&rsquo;s crucial role in Darfur, including the very valuable work of its observer mission, AMIS, in addressing the security situation. Following AMIS&rsquo;s initial deployment a marked reduction in violence followed. In April, the AU decided to expand AMIS from 3,200 to more than 7,700 personnel and approximately 6,773 are currently deployed.</P>
        <P>The June General Affairs and External Relations Council approved a joint action by the European Union providing civilian and military support to AMIS, appointed Mr. Pekka Haavisto as EU Special Representative for Sudan and allocated of &euro; 2.12 million for this purpose. The EU has also provided &euro;92 million from the Africa Peace Facility for AMIS and will shortly allocate a further &euro;70 million. NATO is also supplying logistical support to AMIS. In 2004-2005, Ireland has allocated &euro;1.5 million to AMIS which is being used for human rights, humanitarian and policing aspects of the mission. The Government has also made available an officer from the Permanent Defence Forces to serve as a logistics planner in supporting the expansion of AMIS. An Army officer served as an EU observer with the mission up to June 2005.</P>
        <P>It is deeply regrettable that there has been a recent escalation in violence in west Darfur, with attacks on internally displaced persons, IDPs, humanitarian workers and members of the African Union mission in Sudan. The General Affairs and External Relations Council on 7 November strongly condemned these attacks and called on all sides to rein in fighters involved in the recent clashes in Darfur. The UN Security Council has also condemned these attacks. The current AMIS mandate runs to January 2006 and the African Union will shortly undertake a review of the situation in Darfur and AMIS operations. This review, in which the EU will participate, is expected to also consider the future funding and mandate of AMIS.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 85 together.</P>
        <P>The European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, is an integral part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and serves the Union&rsquo;s general objectives of peace and stability. These objectives and the provisions governing the ESDP are set out in the Treaties of Amsterdam and of Nice, which were approved by referendum. In this context, the European Union is increasing its ability to contribute to both the civilian and military dimensions of crisis management.</P>
        <P>It is important to distinguish between the ESDP, which continues to develop, and the possibility of a common defence. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states&rsquo; constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move. In any event, Ireland&rsquo;s position is clear. The amendment to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the Irish people would have to amend Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.</P>
        <P>A total of eleven ESDP missions have been launched to date, as follows. The past operations were: EU military operation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, fYROM Concordial; EU military operation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC Artemis; and EU rule of law mission in Georgia, EUJUST Themis. The current operations are: EU military operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR Althea; EU police mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, EUPOL Proxima; EU police mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUPM; EU police mission in Kinshasa, DRC, EUPOL Kinshasa; EU integrated rule of law mission for Iraq, EUJUST Lex; EU mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, EUSEC DRC; EU support to AMIS II, Darfur; and EU monitoring mission in Aceh, AMM.</P>
        <P>Ireland is participating in three of the Union&rsquo;s current missions. There are 54 members of the Defence Forces serving with EUFOR Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is a follow-on mission, led by the EU, to the NATO-led SFOR. <Col N="1780"/>Both missions were authorised by the UN Security Council.</P>
        <P>Assistant Commissioner Kevin Carty, of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, heads the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUPM. A small number of other garda&iacute; are also serving in this mission.</P>
        <P>Ireland is contributing three personnel to the EU&rsquo;s civilian Aceh monitoring mission, which was established on 15 September 2005. All three are members of the Defence Forces, who possess particular skills relevant to the tasks of the mission, which include carrying out the decommissioning of weapons handed over by the Free Aceh Movement, GAM, pursuant to the agreement reached between the movement and the Government of Indonesia on 15 August.</P>
        <P>The Union is also continuing to develop its capabilities for crisis management, both military and civilian. The objectives which it has set itself are clearly set out in the Military Headline Goal 2010 and the Civilian Headline Goal 2008.</P>
        <P>An important aspect of ESDP is the development of a stand-by military rapid response capacity, in the form of battlegroups, and my colleague, the Minister for Defence, provided information to the House last week on the progress of consideration of the question of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in these. As the Deputy will be aware, the establishment by the EU of such a capacity has received the strong support of the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and been endorsed in the Outcome Document of the World Summit in September of this year.</P>
        <P>The issue of how the Union&rsquo;s existing civilian crisis management capabilities may be further developed is one which is receiving close attention in the light of the aspirations set out in the Civilian Headline Goal 2008 and lessons learned from the civilian missions undertaken to date. It is important that the EU have at its disposal as wide as possible a range of capabilities, to enable it to provide the most appropriate response in a given situation, which may range from a small team of specialist advisers, as in EUJUST Themis in Georgia, to a contingent of several hundred police officers to monitor, mentor and advise a local force, as in EUPM in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>

	<P>The original UN Flash Appeal for the region affected by the tsunami was for US$97.1 million. This figure was later increased to just over US$1 billion. Ireland pledged &euro;20 million to tsunami relief and that pledge has been fully committed. On a <i>per capita</i> basis, the total combined contribution from the Government and the Irish public was one of the highest in the world.</P><Col N="1782"/>
        <P>The most accurate donor information is found on the financial tracking system of the United Nations which is compiled on the basis of information provided by member states and appealing organisations. Information on pledges to the UN Flash Appeal for the tsunami is set out in the table below. This information does not include contributions to non-UN agencies or bilateral contributions. Some 37% of Ireland&rsquo;s total pledge of &euro;20 million to the tsunami affected regions was committed to UN agencies. The balance of funding was committed to other partner organisations, such as non-governmental organisations, the Red Cross and multi-donor trust funds. </P><Col N="1781"/>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 66 together.</P><Col N="1783"/><?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting of 7 November 2005, discussed the outcome of the recent informal European Council meeting in Hampton Court, the WTO, the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, avian influenza and several items in the area of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, briefed the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the full Council agenda at its meeting of 2 November 2005.</P>
        <P>As regards to avian influenza, at its meeting on 18 October 2005, the General Affairs and External Relations Council resolved to keep this issue under close review and to return to it if required. In accordance with this decision, the Commission updated the Council at GAERC on Monday on recent developments, including the verification of the H5N1 virus in Croatia and the isolated case of H5N1 in a quarantined bird in the UK. The Council noted that, since its meeting of 18 October, avian influenza had been discussed at the informal meeting of Health Ministers on 20-21 October and at the Agriculture Ministers Council on 24-25 October. Council welcomed these productive discussions and noted Health Ministers&rsquo; conclusions on the importance of effective co-ordination between EU member states that: clear, calm and consistent communication was the key; and that international co-operation with the World Health Organisation should be continued.</P>
        <P>The Council also noted the Commission&rsquo;s intention to adopt communications on influenza pandemic preparedness and response planning in the EU, and on strengthening co-ordination on generic preparedness planning for public health emergencies in the Union. The UK Presidency has established a special co-ordination group to exchange information and ensure co-ordination at a strategic level concerning avian and pandemic influenza. A Council working group is progressing a new avian influenza directive.</P>
        <P>As a precautionary measure, the Commission adopted as early as January 2004 several decisions to ensure that no poultry meat, untreated meat products and birds other than poultry &mdash; such as ornamental and pet birds &mdash; are imported from Asian countries where avian influenza has occurred, including Russia &mdash; Siberia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. These decisions have been amended to take into account recent outbreaks in Turkey, Romania and European Russia. A wide range of measures is already in place at Community level to prevent and control avian influenza and these have been updated following recent developments.</P>
        <P>The Commission is promoting international co-ordination and a harmonised approach of donors to support poor countries most affected, particularly in Asia. In doing so, it is supporting the <Col N="1784"/>global plans prepared by the three international organisations, the International Office of Epizootics, Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, for a strategy emphasising control of the disease at source, while helping those countries to prepare for a possible influenza pandemic.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 86 together.</P>
        <P>While regular contact is maintained with the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, through our Permanent Mission in Geneva and Washington Embassy, there has been no specific correspondence between myself and the ICRC on the subject of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. The ICRC has visited the US detention facility at Guantanamo Bay on a regular basis since early 2002, with a view to seeking to ensure that persons held there are treated in accordance with applicable international laws and standards. The ICRC conducts all of its work on visiting prisoners in confidence.</P>
        <P>Regarding the proposed visit of UN special rapporteurs to Guantanamo Bay, the US has extended an invitation to visit the prisoners detained there to the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief and the chairperson-rapporteur of the working group on arbitrary detention.</P>
        <P>In this connection, the special rapporteurs have insisted that the US allows them free access to all detainees and the opportunity to carry out private interviews with them. It is my understanding that the US Government has not yet officially responded to this call, but there are reports that it is reluctant to accede to these requests.</P>
        <P>I urge the US Government to give positive consideration to the request of the special rapporte<Col N="1785"/>urs, in order to allow them to carry out a full and fair assessment of the situation of the detainees held in Guantanamo Bay. I recall that the Government has, on a number of occasions, made known to the US Government its concerns regarding the treatment and status of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. The United States is well aware of the Government&rsquo;s view that those detained at Guantanamo Bay should be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law. These concerns are shared by our EU partners.</P>

	<P>Since January 2000, Ireland has allocated over &euro;28 million in funding for development and humanitarian programmes in Afghanistan. Ireland&rsquo;s funding to Afghanistan is delivered through a range of partners with a proven record of delivering assistance to those most in need and through mechanisms such as World Bank trust funds, designed to build capacity and to deliver essential services. Our partners are , <i>inter alia </i>, Christian Aid, Concern, GOAL, Halo Trust, Handicap International, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire, the Red Cross family, World Vision, UNDP, UNICEF and the World Food Programme, WFP. The activities supported include primary education, nutrition and health, de-mining, election preparations and support.</P>
        <P>Funding recipients are obliged to provide financial and monitoring reports to my Department on a regular basis. In 2004, Development Co-operation Ireland carried out a comprehensive external public expenditure review of Ireland&rsquo;s support to Afghanistan during the period 2000 to 2003. This evaluation reviews in detail Ireland&rsquo;s assistance to Afghanistan and outlines all payments made to partners over the period. The evaluators visited Afghanistan and had discussions with partners and recipients. The evaluation examined the effectiveness, cost efficiency and sustainability of Ireland&rsquo;s support. The report found that this support represented value for money for the Irish taxpayer and recommended that Ireland&rsquo;s policy of funding in Afghanistan should continue. A number of other recommendations were made and these are being <Col N="1786"/>implemented. The published report was laid before the House on 5 April 2005. A copy was sent to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 11 April 2005. Since 2003, Ireland has continued to fund humanitarian and recovery programmes in Afghanistan. These are outlined in the tables below: </P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the EU code of conduct on arms exports. Currently, all exports of arms from EU countries must conform to the EU code of conduct on arms exports, which establishes criteria to control such exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods, including respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability.</P>
        <P>The review of the code of conduct on arms exports was initiated during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU and takes account of developments <Col N="1787"/>since the code entered into force in 1998. Several proposals have been made to strengthen and update the code, including a proposal to reinforce its status by transforming it into an EU common position, which would be legally binding. Ireland is in favour of such a move. The examination of the code of conduct by officials from the member states is nearing finalisation at working group level. We believe that this, the first review of the code of conduct, is a very necessary and important undertaking for the EU and we have been supportive of efforts to strengthen it.</P>
        <P>We have also had contacts with civil society on this issue. Representatives from several EU member states, including Ireland, met with a number of NGOs last May to discuss and exchange views on the ongoing review of the code. Ireland also subsequently circulated to all our EU partners, for their consideration, written suggestions made by NGOs for possible improvements.</P>
        <P>As well as the review of the EU code of conduct on arms exports, the EU also recently carried out a peer review of its system governing the export of items which have both civilian and military applications. The first stage of the peer review was completed in July 2004. It was conducted in clusters of two to three countries each, which examined national legislation and its implementation in order to establish best practices in the enlarged Union. The Commission co-ordinated the peer review and was assisted by a task force, which drew up an analysis and recommendations based on reports from the clustered countries. The European Union is currently considering how best to implement those recommendations.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the Irish United Nations Association, IUNA, is a voluntary body and a member of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. The task of these associations is to promote and sustain understanding of, and support for, the work of the United Nations among the general public in UN member states. I am very conscious and appreciative of the valuable contribution made by IUNA in sustaining support for the United Nations among the Irish public.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is for the association as an NGO, to consider in the first instance how it can further develop its activities. My Department has increased the annual support provided to the association from £7,000 in 1999 to &euro;35,000 this year. In addition the Department has provided one-off grants for the purchase of information technology equipment and for office refurbishment.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, met representatives of IUNA in September and officials of my Department met them last week. Following these meetings my officials are considering how the Department can most fruitfully and effectively develop its collaboration with the association.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s continuing concern about the human rights situation in Belarus is communicated frequently to the Belarus authorities, principally through EU channels but also through bilateral diplomatic contacts, which are relatively active: the Ambassador of Belarus last visited Ireland in April, the Irish Ambassador visited Belarus in May. Our human rights concerns in Belarus were underlined on both occasions, as they were when the Belarus Embassy approached my Department before this week&rsquo;s Council discussion of Belarus. My visit to Belarus on 9 May was undertaken in my capacity as Special Envoy of the UN Secretary General on UN reform and as such did not address directly the human rights situation in Belarus. Ireland supports the series <Col N="1789"/>of EU declarations made in recent months in response to the increasing repression of civil society in Belarus.</P>
        <P>At its meeting in Brussels on 7 November, the General Affairs and External Relations Council again expressed its deep concern at the deteriorating situation of human rights and political freedoms in Belarus, mentioning specifically the harassment of political parties, independent media, NGOs and civil society organisations. The Council confirmed its determination to intensify the EU&rsquo;s support for democracy and human rights in Belarus and stated its readiness to take further appropriate restrictive measures against the responsible individuals in the event of failure to uphold international standards.</P>
        <P>If the deteriorating human rights trend is not reversed, it is feared that next year&rsquo;s presidential election in Belarus may come no nearer to meeting international standards for free and fair elections than the unsatisfactory parliamentary elections and referendum of October 2004. Noting the importance of the presidential election, the Council called on the Belarusian Government to invite a full OSCE-ODIHR election observation mission and allow it to operate unimpeded and to ensure also that all eligible candidates are allowed to register, campaign freely and enjoy equal access to state-controlled media. Each of these elements needs to be pursued.</P>
        <P>The Council reaffirmed the policy of limited ministerial contact with Belarus, highlighting at the same time the EU&rsquo;s willingness to engage with Belarusian officials. I welcome the announcement of new channels of contact for both Council and Commission with Belarus at official level. A point of contact on Belarus is being established under the authority of Dr. Javier Solana, who intends to send his personal representative for human rights, Mr. Michael Matthiessen, to Belarus before the end of the year. The Council reaffirmed the policy of limited ministerial contact with Belarus, highlighting at the same time the EU&rsquo;s willingness to engage with Belarusian officials. I welcome the announcement of new channels of contact for both Council and Commission with Belarus at official level.</P>
        <P>In the same timeframe, the Commission intends to open a regionalised delegation in Minsk. My hope is that increased contact at official level will help to broaden the EU dialogue with Belarus and thereby contribute over time to an improvement in relations. The Council has again reiterated this week its willingness to have closer and better relations with Belarus, once the authorities there demonstrate respect for democratic values and the rule of law. The choice is theirs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>The Government responds to requests to participate in constitutional referendums and election observation missions in a positive manner and ensures, where possible, that Irish representatives are included in such missions. Over the past ten years, Ireland has been invited to send observers to approximately 150 missions and has participated in over 80 missions involving more than 610 observers, of whom at least 25 were political representatives.</P>
        <P>Irish parliamentarians have played an important role in election and constitutional referenda missions organised by such bodies as the European Union, the Council of Europe, the European Parliamentarians for Africa and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE. Elected representatives bring valuable insights and experience to the work of observer missions. However, the availability of serving Oireachtas Members is constrained when either or both Houses are in session.</P>
        <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs assumed direct responsibility for election observation missions from the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, APSO, on 1 January 2004. Since then, we have taken a proactive approach to the involvement of Irish parliamentarians, former and present, in observer missions funded by the Department.</P>
        <P>The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, wrote to the Ceann Comhairle at <Col N="1791"/>the beginning of this year, inviting all Oireachtas members to become more involved in observation missions. In 2005, we have been invited to participate in 16 missions and have accepted 12 invitations. To date, we have posted 51 election observers of whom eight were parliamentarians, past or present. In this regard, I was particularly pleased to see that former Member of the European Parliament, Mr. John Cushnahan, is to lead the European Union election observation mission to Sri Lanka. Invitations to take part in the forthcoming missions in Kazakhstan and Venezuela are under consideration and are being looked at with a view to making a positive response. We intend to continue to take a positive approach to having an Irish presence in monitoring missions, where and whenever possible, including an active role by parliamentarians.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos 70, 74, 96 and 98 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputies can be assured that the welfare of the undocumented Irish in the US is a matter of the highest priority for the Government. I would refer Deputies to the reply given by me earlier to the priority question on the same subject. In all our contacts with US political leaders, including when the Taoiseach and I met with President Bush in March, we emphasised the importance of addressing the situation in a posi<Col N="1792"/>tive and sympathetic way. In doing so, we of course appreciate that immigration is a highly divisive issue in the United States, in particular since the tragic events of 11 September 2001.</P>
        <P>On my visit to New York and Boston last week, I stressed the high priority that the Government attaches to the welfare of the undocumented and the need to deal with immigration reform in an effective and sensitive way. In addition to Irish immigration groups and the Irish-American media, I also briefed the editorial board of the <i>New York Times </i>and former President Clinton on the situation. I wish to pay particular tribute to the understanding shown, and support with his contacts promised, by the former President. To further intensify our efforts, I will visit Washington later this month and strongly underline the priority the Government attaches to securing the desired reforms.</P>
        <P>I would also like to express the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the all-party support for the Government&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the undocumented. Many Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Kenny who visited the US last week, have given generously of their time and resources to this important issue. The consensus in the Oireachtas was clearly demonstrated by the contribution of colleagues in both Houses during the debate on the all-party motion on this issue last month.</P>
        <P>The legislative debate in Washington DC is entering a critical phase with various proposals under consideration, including the Bill jointly sponsored by Senators McCain and Kennedy. If this Bill were adopted in its present form, it would provide a path to permanent residency and, thereby enable the undocumented to participate in the life of their adopted country free from fear and uncertainty. The Government strongly supports this Bill and I have instructed the Washington Embassy and consulates to intensify their lobbying in support of it.</P>
        <P>In addition to my commitment to advance the interests of the undocumented through legislative reform, I recently announced grants to Irish immigration centres in the US totalling US$915,000. This represented an increase of 40% on last year. I suggest that any Irish person in the US in need of guidance and support at this complex time of change should approach one of these centres. They provide a range of invaluable information and advisory services, and we are warmly appreciative of their work. While in New York last week, I again had the opportunity to see their work at first hand, and to convey our deep appreciation for it, as I know Deputy Kenny did, also.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The fifth and final report of the Independent Inquiry Committee, ICC, established by the UN Secretary General to examine irregularities in the operation of the Iraq oil for food programme, OFFP, was issued on 26 October in New York. The report focused on the manner in which the Saddam Hussein regime manipulated the programme to gain illegal income though the imposition of surcharges on purchases of oil, and through demanding illicit payments, &ldquo;kickbacks&rdquo;, in return for the award of contracts for the supply of goods imported under the OFFP. It contains tables with lists of the companies involved in various ways with the programme, and details the extent of their payment of surcharges and kickbacks.</P>
        <P>The UN Secretary General, in reacting to this report, said he hoped that national authorities would take action, where appropriate, against companies falling within their jurisdiction. The report has been drawn to the attention of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>Any misuse of the UN oil for food programme, which was established for the purpose of relieving the humanitarian situation of the Iraq people, is <Col N="1794"/>to be deplored. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases listed in the report.</P>
        <P>As I said in a press statement on the fourth report of the IIC, which looked at the management of the programme by the UN, this large and complex initiative achieved many vital humanitarian goals in Iraq. A full investigation was nonetheless necessary to identify the weaknesses in the programme&rsquo;s structure and implementation, and to ensure that the UN system addressed these. The committee made valuable recommendations for strengthening the management and accountability of the organisation.</P>
        <P>I noted that while the committee ascribes deficiencies in management oversight to Secretary General Annan, it found unambiguously that no evidence exists that he sought to influence the procurement process for the programme. The committee also pointed out that responsibility for failures in oversight is widely shared, including by the members of the Security Council. During its membership of the Security Council in 2001-2002, Ireland worked hard to ensure that the programme was better adapted to alleviating the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people. The recent UN World Summit supported the Secretary General in his ongoing efforts to strengthen the UN&rsquo;s secretariat and its management, and invited him to come forward with further proposals in this regard.</P>

	<P>My comment regarding the complexity of the issue was in reference to such considerations as the scope of the proposed international arms trade treaty and the wish of its proponents that it be a legally-binding document.</P>
        <P>Experience within the United Nations in the past has shown that negotiations involving 191 states on such matters have been complex and consensus is often difficult to achieve. There have been successes in this field in recent years, including most recently an international instrument to enable states to identify and trace, in a timely and reliable manner, illicit small arms and light weapons, which was adopted last June. Even here, however, it was not possible to agree a legally binding text, for which we and our partners in the European Union had pressed.</P><Col N="1795"/>

	<P>The advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice on 9 July 2004 on the construction of the wall on occupied Palestinian territory is not binding, but it represents a clear and authoritative statement of the position in international law. The Government believes it must be respected. The Government and its partners in the European Union have reaffirmed this position on many occasions. Ireland supported UN General Assembly Resolution ES-10/15, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in response to the International Court of Justice&rsquo;s advisory opinion.</P>
        <P>The EU has consistently affirmed its position regarding the legality of Israel&rsquo;s actions in constructing the separation barrier, and in particular with regard to its route. We recognise absolutely Israel&rsquo;s right to provide for the security of its citizens, but the construction of the separation barrier on occupied territory represents an obstacle to the implementation of the quartet roadmap, and therefore to the prospects of a peaceful and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am also very concerned over its humanitarian and economic consequences and the infringements of recognised principles of human rights for the Palestinian population.</P>
        <P>On the issue of settlements, the Government has consistently taken the view that the transfer by an occupying power of its own population into occupied territory constitutes a breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The establishment of settlements by the Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories is contrary to international law.</P>
        <P>The Government has conveyed its concerns on these issues directly to the Israeli Government on many occasions. I raised them when I met Foreign Minister Shalom in Jerusalem on 12 July.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council, which I attended in Brussels on 7 November, reiterated the concern of the EU. The Council urged the Israeli Government to cease all activities in the Palestinian territories, including settlement building, the construction of the separation barrier and the demolition of Palestinian homes, which are contrary to international law and threaten to make any solution based on the coexistence of two states physically impossible. The Council expressed particular concern over the implementation of these policies in and around east Jerusalem, and recalled that the EU will not recognise any change to the pre-1967 borders which has not been arrived at by agreement between the parties.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The core objective of the Department of Foreign Affairs in providing consular services is to assist and protect the interests of Irish citizens who live or travel abroad. In providing consular services, the Department is guided by a number of international agreements which established international norms for the treatment of non-nationals by host countries. They also prescribe rights of states in acting to protect the interests of its citizens abroad. The foremost amongst these is the Vienna Convention On Consular Relations which was incorporated into Irish law in 1967.</P>
        <P>The Department has a network of diplomatic missions abroad and one of the principal purposes of a mission is to provide consular services to Irish citizens. The main consular services provided by our embassies and consulates abroad include issuing emergency passports; assistance to victims of serious accidents, illnesses or crime; assisting people detained, arrested or imprisoned abroad; transferring funds to Irish citizens abroad where conventional means are unreliable or non-existent; repatriation of Irish citizens in emergency circumstances; and assistance in connection with deaths abroad and the return of remains to Ireland. However, it is the right of every state, including Ireland, to make its own domestic law and many countries have administrative, legal and law enforcement systems different from those in Ireland. These reflect local customs and practices. Those laws and requirements must of course be respected when an Irish citizen travels abroad.</P>
        <P>The Department has been involved in the negotiations at the EU consular affairs working group meetings on the drawing up of guidelines on closer consular co-operation between member states. These negotiations were the basis for the declaration in the European Council on 16-17 December 2004, which confirmed the importance of intensified consular co-operation amongst member states in normal times and in times of crises, thus helping them to deal more effectively <Col N="1798"/>with the increasing demand for consular services. These discussions on consular issues are ongoing within the consular affairs working group and at the high-level meeting of consular officials held during each Presidency.</P>
        <P>I assure the Deputy that the Department will continue to work closely with other member states to streamline procedures for dealing with common problems, including fatalities, faced by EU citizens in other member states.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I advised the Deputy on 26 October, Irish officials at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast were asked at the time to seek clarification from the British authorities as to the basis for the arrest of Mr Sean Garland. It was indicated that Mr. Garland was provisionally arrested on foot of a request from the United States Government for his extradition. The request for extradition was made on the basis that Mr. Garland is the subject of an indictment filed on 19 May 2005 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The United States authorities want Mr. Garland to stand trial on counterfeiting charges.</P>
        <P>Mr. Garland was released on bail subject to the payment of surety and daily reporting to a PSNI station. Mr. Garland was also instructed to reside at an address in Northern Ireland pending the receipt of appropriate documentation from the US authorities to support the extradition request. I understand his bail conditions have since been varied and he has been able to leave Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>As I have stated, the United States authorities are aware of the interest of the Government in this case. However, as the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, said in the D&aacute;il during the Adjournment debate on 20 October, the Government is not in a position to interfere in legal proceedings that are taking place in another jurisdiction. Such matters are for the courts alone to <Col N="1799"/>decide, and therefore further comment on the details of the case would be inappropriate at this time.</P>

	<P>I was saddened to learn of the death of Rosa Parks on 24 October last at the age of 92. A formal message of condolence has not been sent to the US ambassador as this would usually be the practice only in the case of current or former office holders. I am pleased, however, to have this opportunity to record the Government&rsquo;s admiration for her remarkable contribution as a civil rights pioneer.</P>
        <P>Ms Parks&rsquo;s place of honour in the history of the United States is rightly guaranteed. Her courage in the face of injustice contributed to the emergence of a more fair and equal society. It also influenced others far beyond the United States.

	<P>I am aware of the matter to which the Deputy refers. I know that a recent television documentary shown here on the return of refugees to North Korea from China has increased awareness and concern on the issue in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Ireland, together with our partners in the European Union, takes concerns about the human rights situation and the treatment of refugees in <Col N="1800"/>China very seriously. Human rights issues are a constant point of discussion in our bilateral and EU level dialogue with the Chinese authorities. Most recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, met the Chinese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in Beijing on 21 September and they discussed a wide range of issues, including human rights.</P>
        <P>The EU-China human rights dialogue is the agreed formal framework through which the EU raises its concerns with China about individual human rights cases and more general issues. At the latest round of the human rights dialogue, held in Beijing on 24 October, the EU raised once more its concern regarding forced returns of North Korean refugees and urged China to work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and to respect its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 143 together.</P>
        <P>I would refer the Deputies to my comprehensive reply to Questions Nos. 76 and 112 of 6 October on the security, political and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. The security situation remains a matter of serious concern. On 21 October nine policemen were killed when suspected Taliban rebels ambushed their convoy in Kandahar province. A British soldier participating in the international security assistance force in Afghanistan was killed in an attack in Mazar-e-Sharif on 29 October in which five of his colleagues were injured.</P>
        <P>I referred in my reply of 6 October to the successful holding of parliamentary and provincial elections on 18 September. Certified results of the elections to the lower house of Parliament, the Wolesi Jirga, and to provincial councils are now <Col N="1802"/>available for most of Afghanistan&rsquo;s provinces. The results from a small number of provinces, including Kabul, have not yet been certified by the joint electoral management body, JEMB, an independent body set up to administer and oversee the electoral process, but are expected in the coming days. Analysis of the results confirms that the Wolesi Jirga, as expected, will be highly fragmented with neither government nor opposition having a majority. Ethnically, it will be a hung Parliament, with a fine balance between Pashtun and non-Pashtun groups.</P>
        <P>Provinces with certified results are scheduled to hold inaugural meetings of the provincial councils on 10 November. Representatives to the upper house, the Meshrano Jirga, will be elected by the provincial councils on 12 November. President Karzai will nominate one third of the membership of the upper house.</P>
        <P>The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting on 7 November, approved a draft EU-Afghanistan Joint Declaration committing the EU to a new EU-Afghan partnership which is due to be signed with Afghanistan on 16 November.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants produced a very good report with wide-ranging conclusions, covering the full range of emigrant needs. Its recommendations were far-reaching and varied and the implementation of some of these will be, by necessity, on a phased basis over a number of years. Considerable progress has already been made, with action underway on over two thirds of its recommendations. A great many of the recommendations in the report relate to issues of continuing importance which will require on-going action from all partners, in <Col N="1803"/>Government and the voluntary sector, in Ireland and abroad.</P>
        <P>The high priority which the Government attaches to this area of national policy is reflected in the establishment of a dedicated unit in my Department &mdash; the Irish abroad unit &mdash; to work exclusively on the issue. Funding for emigrant services continues to increase very substantially. This year the allocation is more than eight times greater than it was in 1997. In all, grants in 2005 will amount to &euro;8.273 million, representing a 63% increase on last year. I expect to see a further significant increase in the coming year.</P>
        <P>A particular priority is the need to support our most vulnerable and marginalised communities abroad, in particular our older community in Britain. In this regard, the considerably increased funding has enabled enhanced support to be given to voluntary agencies engaged at the front-line with vulnerable communities. In addition, these agencies are engaged in the provision of pre-departure services, as well as advice and assistance to emigrants wishing to return to Ireland. Groups in Britain will this year receive &euro;7 million, an increase of 61% on last year. The higher allocation has allowed us to respond positively to requests from organisations there to increase funding and to widen the eligibility criteria. While the primary emphasis of funding continues to be on supporting front line welfare services, I am pleased that additional funding has made it possible to support a number of capital projects as well as some projects of a social or cultural nature which help to foster a greater sense of community. So far this year, I have approved grants to 102 organisations, the highest number ever.</P>
        <P>In September I approved grants of &euro;750,000 to groups in the US, an increase of 40% on last year. I am currently considering funding for groups in Australia and Canada. This year I have also approved increased financial support for groups in Ireland engaged in the provision of pre-departure services and assistance to emigrants wishing to return to Ireland, both areas also identified by the task force as meriting greater support.</P>
        <P>Another area to which I have attached particular priority this year is the welfare of our undocumented community in the US. The legislative debate in the US on immigration reform is entering a critical phase. In the light of the high priority which the Government attaches to securing the desired reform, and assisted by the important all-party resolutions passed recently in both Houses of the Oireachtas, I am intensifying our lobbying efforts, including through visits to Washington, New York and Boston. Likewise, I have instructed the embassy and the consulates in the US to intensify their lobbying in pursuit of our position.</P><Col N="1804"/>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured that the welfare of our citizens abroad has the highest ongoing priority for the Government. My Department will continue to maintain very close contact with front line organisations to ensure that the voluntary sector has an effective channel of communication with the Government. In this way we can continue to ensure that everything possible is done to help, and to advance, the interests of our community living abroad.</P>

        <Quest>the position regarding chicken that is being imported from EU counties and relabelled as Irish chicken; if this is happening at present; if so, her plans regarding same; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The labelling of poultry meat within the European Union is regulated by a number of legislative instruments. First, all pre-packaged food, including pre-packaged poultry meat, must adhere to the general labelling requirements of Council Directive 2000/13/EC, as amended. According to these rules, origin labelling is not normally required for packaged food unless its absence misleads the consumer. Therefore, pre-packaged poultry meat such as chicken breasts do not have to indicate their origin. However, where other particulars on the label might mislead the consumer as to the true origin or provenance or the food, such as a flag or a map other than that of the country of origin, the true country of origin must be clearly declared.</P>
        <P>The principal aim of this legislation is to inform the consumer of the properties of the food being purchased and to enable consumers to make informed choices. It is therefore an offence under Council Directive 2000/13/EC, both to indicate on the label the origin other than the true origin of chicken meat and to mislead the consumer as to the true origin of the food. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland has overall responsibility for the enforcement of food labelling legislation in Ireland. The statutory agencies currently enforcing this legislation under service contract to the FSAI are the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Communications, <Col N="1805"/>Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Service Executive, local authorities and the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2913/92 establishing the Community customs code, any goods &mdash; including food &mdash; whose production involves more than one country shall be deemed to originate in the country where they last underwent substantial processing. Thus, for example, imported poultry meat which is imported into Ireland and further processed into chicken pie here, may be labelled as a product of Ireland. The European Commission is currently reviewing the horizontal labelling legislation in order to recast and modernise its provisions. The Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs commissioned a report on the evaluation of food labelling legislation, one of the recommendations of which is to investigate the extension of mandatory origin labelling to other meats in addition to beef, as well as to consider the type of indication of origin required by consumers, for example, the place of production, slaughter and so on.</P>
        <P>My Department would welcome mandatory rules requiring details of origin to be given on the label of poultry meat and this would be in line with the report of the food labelling group established by the Minister for Agriculture and Food in 2002. One of the recommendations of that report was that information on the origin of fresh, chilled and frozen sheep meat, pig meat and poultry meat, sold in retail outlets, pre-packaged or otherwise, should be declared. Informal discussions between the Commission and member states on the recasting of the labelling legislation have commenced and a Commission proposal is expected in 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Insurance Acts and the provisions of the risk equalisation scheme 2003, participating insurers submit data returns to the Health Insurance Authority on a six-monthly basis, and the authority analyses these returns to assess the level of risk differential between the insurers in order to make its recommendation to me regarding the commencement or non-commencement of risk equalisation transfers.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the terms of the scheme, the authority has received returns covering four six monthly periods since 1 July 2003. I decided last June not to commence risk equalisation transfers, having considered the recommendation made by the Health Insurance Authority when it submitted its third report and the subsequent representations made by health insurance undertakings. I am currently considering the authority&rsquo;s fourth report. I am satisfied that the current arrangements are appropriate and that they do not impose unreasonable demands on insurers in the market. Any insurer operating, or intending to operate in the market will be aware that recourse to risk equalisation is a feature of the Irish health insurance regulatory framework.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they conducted on-site deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, look back audits on 37 financial institutions during 1999 and 2000 and reported to the Committee of Public Accounts on the outcomes. The details are provided in the final report of the committee dated 3 April 2001. As a result of the look back audit programme, financial institutions made payments totalling &euro;220 million to Revenue. These payments represented DIRT, which should have been deducted, together with the related interest and penalties. Four institutions made larger settlements than that made by National Irish Bank. In general the largest settlements related to the largest institutions.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that there are a number of incentives in place to assist owner-occupiers in purchasing residential property. There is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers where the dwelling is not greater than 125 square metres and complies with certain conditions with regard to building standards. If the property is over 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value or one-quarter of the total value of the property, whichever is the greater.</P>
        <P>Also, I introduced a stamp duty-relieving measure in the 2005 budget for first-time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses by increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold for such purchasers from &euro;190,500 to &euro;317,500 and by having reduced rates for house values up to &euro;635,000.</P>
        <P>Mortgage interest relief is also available at source in respect of interest paid on monies borrowed for the purchase, maintenance, repair or improvement of that taxpayer&rsquo;s main residence.

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 129, 130 and 133 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Fisheries Acts, the central and regional fisheries boards are primarily responsible for the management and protection of fisheries, including measures relating to enforcement. The wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme, first introduced by the Department through the fisheries boards in 2001, is intended to <i>inter alia</i> identify illegally caught salmon, eliminate sales outlets for such illegal fish and to improve traceability in the distribution chain. The programme provided, for the first time, an estimate of the previously unrecorded illegal catch in Ireland, which at that time, I am advised, was estimated at 32%.</P>
        <P>The current mandatory application of carcass tags and logbooks has alleviated some of the difficulty in identifying illegally caught salmon. Approximately 100% of commercial fishing logbooks and 58% of anglers&rsquo; logbooks were returned to the fisheries boards in 2004. An adjustment to the reported catch to take into account the numbers of fish that have been caught by anglers who have not returned logbooks is made in accordance with international practice.</P>
        <P>The national illegal unreported catch of wild salmon is assumed to be approximately 10%. Based on direct monitoring of dealers and knowledge of the local fisheries, this is considered by many fishery inspectors to be an overestimate. A large proportion of all fisheries boards&rsquo; resources have been and continue to be allocated to the protection of wild salmon. Efforts concentrate on the elimination of the practice of illegal fishing, by both the central and regional boards. These include sea, land and river based protection programmes. The national protection programme is <Col N="1815"/>integrated with the navy, air corps and the garda&iacute;. Ongoing monitoring of catch statistics is achieved through the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme. Statistics in this regard are detailed in the annual fisheries statistics report of the central fisheries board and the fisheries boards&rsquo; annual report.</P>

	<P>In 2004, Sustainable Energy Ireland published a report entitled, A Liquid Biofuels Strategy for Ireland. Figures provided in this report show that in 2004, the cost of petrol at the filling station, exclusive of excise duty and VAT, was 33c per litre, compared with production costs of 58c per litre for wheat-based bioethanol and 74c per litre for sugar beet-based bioethanol. In addition, due to differences in energy content of bioethanol compared to petrol, approximately 1.5 litres of bioethanol is required to replace 1 litre of petrol. The cost of petrol has of course risen significantly in 2005 and the published figures for the second quarter show the price at the pump was 39.2c per litre, exclusive of excise duty and VAT.</P>

	<P>With regard to the proposed International Arms Trade Treaty, ATT, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, at its meeting on 3 October 2005, acknowledged the growing support throughout the world for an international treaty to establish common standards for the global trade in conventional arms. The Council also agreed that binding standards, consistent with the existing responsibilities of states under relevant international law, would be critical in tackling proliferation. It was further agreed that the United Nations was the only forum that could deliver a truly universal instrument and the Council called for the start of a formal process at the UN at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>As I made clear in my reply to Question No. 82 of 6 October, Ireland fully supports this approach and believes it is the best way for taking this issue forward. Ireland strongly supports the process of developing strict controls on arms and will continue to participate actively within the UN and at other international fora to promote the objective of strengthening arms controls globally.</P>
        <P>In this context, I would recall that officials from my Department have participated in a number of meetings on the ATT with other government rep<Col N="1817"/>resentatives and civil society in the past two years.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland was among the first countries to respond to the south Asia earthquake disaster. Within a few hours of the earthquake, &euro;1 million was pledged towards immediate relief efforts in northern Pakistan and the surrounding regions. As the casualty figures rose dramatically, our response was increased to &euro;5 million, placing Ireland as one of the highest donors to the disaster on a per capita basis. Ireland&rsquo;s rapid contribution has been warmly and broadly welcomed.</P>
        <P>The UN response to the disaster was also rapid and its agencies quickly deployed in the field. UNICEF, for example, had pre-positioned supplies which it immediately disbursed. However, the logistical capacity of the UN was tested to its limits by the scale of the disaster and the nature of the terrain. The nature of the demands on the UN changed a number of times as needs shifted. The priority of search and rescue shifted to evacuation and the management of large camps for the 3 million people rendered homeless. The priority needs changed again as large numbers of injured arrived, often suffering from infections from untreated wounds. Now the priority is to rescue and sustain people before winter arrives. Indeed, all of these demands are now simultaneous to some degree.</P>
        <P>In this extremely challenging context, I wish to commend all those involved in the humanitarian response, including the UN, the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the Governments of Pakistan and India and the NGOs on the ground, including Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, GOAL and others.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt, however, that the UN&rsquo;s response has been hampered by the inadequate response to the UN&rsquo;s appeal. The updated UN Flash Appeal for the region has called for nearly $550 million in funding for immediate relief needs. A little over &euro;130 million has been pledged to date. Some of the pledges made by donors have yet to materialise into confirmed contributions. Even if all the pledges are confirmed, it still leaves a very considerable shortfall.</P>
        <P>I support President Musharraf&rsquo;s call for more generous assistance, specifically from Islamic, EU <Col N="1818"/>and OECD states. I am pleased to report to the House that Ireland&rsquo;s pledge to the disaster has been fully committed. It is essential that pledges are honoured so that vital assistance can be delivered to save lives.</P>
        <P>Strengthening the financial resources of the UN itself is one of the key ways of improving its rapid response capacity. The UN is proposing to create a new enhanced fund of some $500 million, which would allow for immediate and large grants to UN agencies rapidly responding to humanitarian disasters. Ireland fully supports this initiative and I have pledged &euro;10 million in support of the proposed central emergency response fund, CERF.</P>
        <P>The UN is only as strong as its member states and their commitment to help it and its agencies do their job in the field. The UN&rsquo;s Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs co-ordinates the humanitarian interventions of UN agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, international and national NGOs and, where appropriate and necessary, the use of heavy lift capacity by military forces. Ireland not only funds many of these organisations, but also measures to strengthen their own rapid response capacities.</P>
        <P>Ireland is closely engaged in the work of the EU to improve civil protection and rapid response capability. The tsunami follow-up action plan has provided a range of options that are being pursued. The further development of the EU&rsquo;s rapid response capacity must complement and support the UN&rsquo;s primary role as co-ordinator in humanitarian disasters.</P>
        <P>At the national level, we are examining ways in which the Government&rsquo;s rapid response to disasters and emergencies can be enhanced through a more direct and operational intervention. This has been under way to a limited extent already, for example, by the work of our Defence Forces personnel in the UN Joint Logistics Centre, which managed the logistical response to the tsunami. A number of options for enhancing our own rapid response have been identified and work on this is being actively pursued.</P>
        <P>Rapid response to sudden-onset disasters is the key to saving lives. The number and scale of natural disasters this year reinforce the need for global resources to be mobilised and deployed rapidly to bring humanitarian relief on a large scale to anywhere in the world. Ireland will continue in its quick and flexible funding response to humanitarian disasters and its robust support for the primary role of the United Nations in co-ordinating the response of the international community. As Irish development assistance increases toward 0.7% by the target date of 2012, strengthening our humanitarian aid and supporting the capacity of the international community <Col N="1819"/>to respond rapidly and effectively will continue to feature prominently in our work.</P>

	<P>My most recent discussions with European counterparts on the issue of Partnership for Peace, PfP, took place at the security forum of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, EAPC, in May this year. The EAPC security forum, which was inaugurated this year, is intended as an annual informal ministerial meeting which provides an opportunity for in-depth discussion of important security policy issues linked to PfP.</P>
        <P>Sweden was chosen to host the inaugural security forum, which was held in &Aring;re on 24 and 25 May this year. It consisted of an informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on 24 May and a broader meeting of delegations on 25 May. The informal Foreign Ministers&rsquo; meeting discussed current operations and future requirements. I emphasised the importance Ireland attaches to developing our capacity to participate in UN-authorised peace support operations.</P>
        <P>On 25 May the portion of the security forum open to all members of the national delegations began. The theme for the second day was, Managing Security &mdash; Our Common Challenge. Events included an opening plenary session, four panel discussions running in parallel with one another and a concluding lunch. Issues such as unresolved European conflicts and co-operation between international organisations in the Balkans and elsewhere were discussed. The media were able to follow most of the forum.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PfP is set out in our five individual partnership programmes, IPP, copies of which have been lodged in the D&aacute;il Library. Ireland&rsquo;s sixth IPP, covering the period 2006 to 2007, is currently being completed by the Department of Defence in consultation with my Department and the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and will be lodged in the Oirechtas Library upon completion. Activities under the partnership programmes consist of training courses, seminars, workshops, conferences, staff exercises and table top exercises.</P><Col N="1820"/>
        <P>Ireland also participates in the PfP planning and review process, PARP. In common with the other EU neutral and non-aligned states, Ireland is using the PARP process in connection with planning for humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping and crisis management, collectively known as the Petersberg tasks. The scope of our involvement in PARP is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment.</P>
        <P>Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation. This principle provides that a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation. This allows the Government to determine for itself the manner and scope of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PfP activities.</P>
        <P>It is the Government&rsquo;s policy to stay in the mainstream of peacekeeping. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in PfP enables our peacekeepers to remain abreast of developments in areas such as training, interoperability and humanitarian aspects of peacekeeping. Participation enhances the ability of our peacekeepers to work with those of other countries and also enables us to share our own peacekeeping skills with a wide range of countries. It is important that Ireland be represented on occasions when matters in the field of peacekeeping in which we have a legitimate interest are discussed.</P>

	<P>While the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, remains difficult, there have been some encouraging signs. The major priority continues to be the organisation of national elections early next year, which will mark the culmination of the transition process inaugurated by the 2002 Sun City peace accords. These local, legislative and presidential elections are expected to take place between March and May 2006. Voter registration has generally proceeded well, with more than 19 million people out of an estimated total electorate of 28 million now registered. A referendum on the draft constitution approved by the Transitional National Assembly last May is planned for 18 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The successful holding of national elections in the DRC, the first in over 40 years, will be a <Col N="1821"/>major undertaking. Substantial international support will be required for the elections, which are likely to cost in the region of $400 million to organise. These elections are important, not only for the future stability and democratic development of the DRC but also for ensuring peace and security throughout the Great Lakes region as a whole. The EU and its member states have made substantial contributions in support of the electoral process, with the European Commission alone pledging some &euro;150 million. I was pleased to announce a national contribution of &euro;500,000 by Ireland in support of the DRC electoral process during my meeting on 19 September with the DRC&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya, on the margins of the UN General Assembly.</P>
        <P>During my meeting with Foreign Minister Ramazani Baya, I urged the DRC Government to accelerate progress towards completion of the transition process, including by speedy adoption of an electoral law to govern the forthcoming elections. We also discussed the still serious security situation in eastern DRC and the need to complete disarmament of the remaining armed militias, who continue to pose a serious threat there. The DRC Government and armed forces are working in close conjunction with MONUC, the UN peacekeeping mission, to confront the armed militias and hasten their disarmament. Pressure on the rebels to disarm has now been stepped up through the imposition on 1 November 2005 of sanctions against selected militia leaders who are judged by the UN Security Council to have violated the arms embargo in force against the DRC. The UN Security Council, through Resolution 1635 on 28 October 2005, has also authorised an increase of 300 in MONUC&rsquo;s strength in order to enhance its capacity for confronting the continued existence of armed militias.</P>
        <P>The DRC Government also needs to hasten progress in the area of security sector reform, particularly with regard to completing the creation of a fully integrated national army and police and effectively establishing its authority throughout the DRC. This is particularly important, if a secure environment is to be created for the holding of national elections. The EU is actively supporting the process of security sector reform in the DRC, through deployment of two EU missions. EUPOL offers advice and mentoring to the integrated police unit, IPU, in Kinshasa which the EU has helped establish. A second mission, EUSEC DRC, comprises a small planning team to advise key government ministries in the DRC on all issues related to security sector reform. EUSEC DRC has made considerable progress in its work and is playing a particularly important role in identifying ways to improve administration and command through<Col N="1822"/>out the DRC army and ensure proper payment and rationing of troops.</P>
        <P>It is equally important, however, that neighbouring countries, in particular Uganda and Rwanda, do all they can to end the threat posed by the armed militias in eastern DRC, support completion of the transition in the DRC and improve bilateral relations throughout the region. The regional dimension to the conflict remains crucial and underlines the importance of the Great Lakes conference process, the second summit of which is now likely to take place in Nairobi early in the new year. Ireland is an active member of the Group of Friends of the Great Lakes support group, which supports the conference process and was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, at a recent ministerial meeting in New York to discuss preparations for the second summit.</P>

	<P>HIV-AIDS continues to be the single biggest obstacle to reducing poverty and to attaining the millennium development goals, MDGs. Current statistics from the United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS, UNAIDS, indicate that in 2004, almost 40 million people were living with the HIV virus. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to be the worst-affected region in the world and is now home to over 25 million adults and children living with HIV. Approximately 3 million new infections occurred there in 2004, the majority in women, and over 2 million Africans died in that year.</P>
        <P>UNAIDS is leading the effort to track the level of resources needed for HIV prevention, treatment and care, and to ensure adequate financing from public and private sources. The latest UNAIDS estimates of the costs of a comprehensive response to HIV-AIDS suggest that in 2006, almost $15 billion will be required in low and middle income countries rising to just over $22 billion in 2008.</P>
        <P>The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, established in 2002, is expected to be a significant source of funding. It is financed by bilateral donors, including Ireland, and private foundations. Up until 2008, a total of $8.6 billion has been pledged or contributed to the global fund. Ireland has contributed a total of &euro;40 million to this fund to date and has committed a <Col N="1823"/>further &euro;30 million to be released in the next two years.</P>
        <P>At the UN review of the millennium declaration last September, progress was noted in increasing access to HIV treatment particularly in developing countries. The number of people receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy, ART for HIV-AIDS has more than doubled from 400,000 in 2003 to approximately 1 million in June 2005. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people receiving ART has tripled within a period of one year and now reaches approximately 500,000 people.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very strong commitment to addressing HIV-AIDS. It is a key priority for Development Co-operation Ireland&rsquo;s policies and programmes. Financial allocations to the fight against AIDS now constitute 10% of the total overseas development budget and will reach &euro;50 million this year. These resources are directed at a number of HIV-AIDS activities at global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in our programme countries. The latter includes six highly-affected countries in southern and eastern Africa.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports a number of organisations focusing on the delivery of HIV treatment and care including the Clinton Foundation. This foundation aims to increase the number of people accessing HIV treatment and works to reduce the price of anti-retroviral drugs. Most recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs had fruitful discussions with President Clinton on how Ireland and the Clinton Foundation can strengthen their partnership in support of those countries in Africa that are most affected by HIV-AIDS.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach, in his speech to the United Nations in September, reaffirmed Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to HIV-AIDS and announced a new Initiative on HIV-AIDS and other global communicable diseases. This will bring funding for these diseases up to &euro;100 million. This new initiative will focus on tackling the major diseases affecting developing countries including HIV-AIDS. It will build on Ireland&rsquo;s existing support at international, regional and country level and will afford Ireland a stronger voice in international policy dialogue and advocacy for co-ordinated and effective action on HIV-AIDS. The Taoiseach has indicated that up to 20% of the additional funding will be targeted at interventions that benefit children.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to work with the international community in advocating for a sustained and resourced global response to HIV-AIDS, strengthened leadership at all levels and improved co-ordination of re sources and planning for HIV-AIDS prevention and control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144 and 145 together.</P>
        <P>The elimination of starvation and chronic malnutrition in Africa is a key objective of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme. The reduction of hunger is one of the most important tasks to which the international community can dedicate itself at this time. Hunger and malnutrition should have no place in the 21st century.</P>
        <P>The millennium development goals adopted in 2000 aim, <i>inter alia</i>, to halve the proportion of people suffering from hunger by 2015. The review of these goals that led up to the recent UN summit in September, clearly identified Africa as the continent where progress was weakest and where most resources were needed. At the summit, the Taoiseach committed Ireland to reaching the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance, ODA, by 2012. He also outlined a number of initiatives, including placing an even greater priority to addressing the scourge of hunger and food insecurity.</P>
        <P>The symptoms of food insecurity and famine are malnutrition, hunger, disease and death. The causes are complex but include poverty, HIV-AIDS, climate, conflict, unsustainable agricultural practices, environmental degradation and poor policy choices. To address hunger in Africa, the international community and African governments must provide immediate relief through food assistance and associated supports. We must ensure that communities have both sufficient food and access to that food.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s long-term programme of development co-operation aims to reduce poverty and food insecurity through a wide range of interventions, with the ultimate aim of lifting communities out of the endless cycles of bare subsistence living. Our humanitarian programmes are designed to respond quickly and effectively with the aim of saving lives and rebuilding livelihoods. Both programmes work closely together for maximum effectiveness.</P>
        <P>This year the World Food Programme, WFP, is struggling to feed 43 million people in sub-<Col N="1825"/>Saharan Africa. That is double the number in 1995. In 2005, it is estimated that over 2 million children in Africa will have lost their lives to hunger and related diseases.</P>
        <P>The WFP is a key partner for Ireland in the struggle against hunger. Ireland provides the organisation with core funding to allow it to respond rapidly to emerging and under-funded crises. In addition, we also provide funding to specific and targeted emergencies. By the end of 2005, Ireland it is expected that Ireland will have provided over &euro;12 million to the WFP for its operations. In 2005, Ireland has responded to a number of challenging emergencies throughout Africa. Working with partner UN agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross, we have delivered essential emergency and recovery assistance to Niger, Malawi, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Liberia and Sierra Leone.</P>
        <P>The debt cancellation initiative agreed by the G8 countries in July 2005 will cancel nearly all the multilateral debt of 18 of the poorest countries in the world. Most of these are in Africa. For the first time, the most powerful countries have recognised that many poor countries need 100% debt cancellation if they are to address the needs of their people seriously. While I had hoped for more from this initiative, I recognise that it is an important basis from which we can continue to work for a complete and sustainable solution to the debt problem facing poor countries.</P>

	<P>On foot of a request from the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland has been asked by my Department to provide, by the Department of Finance&rsquo;s deadline of 1 December 2005, a revised implementation plan in respect of the decentralisation of the agency&rsquo;s headquarters, including 300 staff, to Shannon. The agency has identified the posts to be transferred and these are advertised as part of the central applications facility, CAF.</P>
        <P>The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new headquarters building, designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Working closely with the OPW, a preferred site, a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development, has been identified. The site has been valued and a feasibility study carried out. When approval is received to proceed with its accommodation arrangements in relation to decentralisation, Enterprise Ireland will be in a position to undertake a detailed planning process in relation to the issues involved.</P>
        <P>In respect of numbers, the most recent figures released show that 19 existing employees in Enterprise Ireland have indicated their willingness to transfer to Shannon. This represents over 6% of the total decentralising workforce of 300 required. The number of applications received from within the civil and public service, including my Department, amount to 33 or 11% of the total number required.</P>
        <P>It is too early to comment definitively on a timescale for the transfer of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s headquarters to Shannon. The factors of significance in this regard will be the acquisition of property and the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Personal Injuries Assess<Col N="1827"/>ment Board, PIAB, was established by ministerial order on the 13 April 2004. From 1 June 2004 all personal injury claims arising from workplace accidents, where an employee is seeking compensation from his-her employer, must be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued. From 22 July 2004 all motor liability and public liability claims must also be referred to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board before legal proceedings are issued.</P>
        <P>The PIAB&rsquo;s core objectives are to: assess the amount of compensation in personal injury cases; to reduce the litigation costs associated with delivering personal injury compensation; and to reduce the amount of time it takes to finalise a personal injury compensation claim.</P>
        <P>Awards in PIAB are made by reference to a book of quantum, which was published by PIAB on 2 June 2004. In producing the book of quantum it was not intended policy to either reduce or increase personal injury compensation levels but merely to reflect, in a guide, what the current level of damages is for particular types of injuries in this country. PIAB utilise an outsourced service centre, SWS, based in Clonakilty, Cork, to assist injured parties in completion of their claim submissions and ensure a comprehensive, fair and independent service is provided. Victims of personal injury accidents may deal directly with PIAB through their helpline facility, open Mondays to Saturdays between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on lo-call 1890 829 121, or through PIAB&rsquo;s website <i>www.piab.ie.</i></P>
        <P>PIAB concluded its first assessments during the first quarter of 2005. In relation to volumes, PIAB expects to assess in the region of 10,000 cases per annum when fully operational. Some 15,500 applications have been received to date from victims of accidents. Of these claims 5,500 have either been settled up-front between parties following initial contact with PIAB, or claim papers are being finalised by claimants. The remaining 10,000 claims are moving through the nine month assessment process. Three out of every four PIAB assessments have been accepted to date. Total compensation awarded so far amounts to &euro;3.74 million.</P>
        <P>Assessments to date have been delivered approximately three times faster and at a delivery charge four times cheaper than through the litigation process. This is very significant considering that in 2004, where an estimated &euro;965 million was paid out in compensation to personal injury victims, litigation costs of an estimated &euro;444 million were incurred in the delivery of this compensation to the victims. As well as being a major benefit to victims of accidents this is a significant reduction in the cost of delivery of compensation and hence facilitates reductions in liability insurance premia.</P><Col N="1828"/>
        <P>It is also worthy of note the impact that PIAB is having on the courts systems with new personal injury case volumes in the High Court dropping from 15,293 in 2004 to just over 400 from January to end-September of this year.</P>
        <P>In relation to the judicial review against the policy of the PIAB of dealing directly with clients rather than through their solicitors, the High Court made its ruling on 25 January 2005. The judge held that the PIAB policy of dealing directly with clients rather than through solicitors was <i>ultra vires</i> the powers conferred on the board by section 7 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act. He ruled that there is no specific power set out in the Act to allow the board to adopt the policy at issue. Costs were awarded against the PIAB. On 28 April 2005, the PIAB gave notice that it was making an appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to the judgment of the High Court and the order for costs. No date has as yet been set. Pending the outcome of the appeal the PIAB is dealing with legal representatives in accordance with the ruling of the High Court. I am very pleased with the operation of PIAB to date and no changes are planned at this point in time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions 150 and 151 together.</P>
        <P>On 28 July last, I announced my decision on a future mandate for Shannon Development. As I have indicated in response to previous similar D&aacute;il questions, this decision was taken in the context of a number of developments that impacted on the future role of Shannon Development. The most significant of these were the proposed relocation of the headquarters of Enterprise Ireland <Col N="1829"/>to Shannon as part of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme; the enterprise strategy group recommendation, which is Government policy, that Shannon Development should disengage from industrial development functions, which should be carried out by the national agencies, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland; and the establishment of an independent Shannon Airport authority.</P>
        <P>Discussions on the future role of the company commenced with Shannon Development early in 2004 and in March 2005 the company submitted proposals on its revised strategy. These proposals provided that the company would exit certain tourism and enterprise support activities and focus instead on strategic value added activities that would contribute to the economic development of the region. Following an examination of these proposals and consultation with the company and other stakeholders, I decided on the revised mandate for the company. The main features of the new mandate are: the company will be responsible for providing appropriate property solutions for both indigenous and overseas enterprises throughout the Shannon region. In this context it will retain ownership of industrial property in the Shannon region and the management and development of the Shannon free zone industrial estate; the company will utilise its property asset base to place an increased focus on the regional development aspects of its mandate and special emphasis will be placed on addressing the needs of the less developed parts of the mid-west region; the enterprise support functions relating to indigenous enterprises in the Shannon region, which are carried out by Shannon Development under delegated authority from EI, will revert to EI; and the IDA will assume responsibility for promoting investment in, and supporting, FDI companies in the Shannon free zone.</P>
        <P>All the interested parties in the region agree that Shannon Airport is vital to its economic well being and that Shannon Development is ideally placed to support the new airport authority and to complement its activities. How this should be done will, however, have to await consideration by the Minister for Transport of the authority&rsquo;s business plan. I have no functional role in tourism and changes to Shannon Development&rsquo;s tourism remit are a matter for decision by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>No job losses in Shannon Development will result from the implementation of the new mandate and consequently no redundancy programme is being devised on foot of my decision. The number of Shannon Development staff who will be offered the option of transferring to Enterprise Ireland has yet to be determined and discussions between my Department and the two agencies to establish this are under way. I have no knowledge of the number of Shannon <Col N="1830"/>Development staff who have expressed an interest in transferring to Enterprise Ireland.</P>

Edward Henneberry, who was appointed in September 2003, holds both US and Irish citizenships. In October 2005 Dr. Stanley Wong, a Canadian citizen, was appointed as whole-time member and he will take up office with effect from February 2006. In October I also appointed Ms Noreen Mackey, an Irish citizen, as part-time member to ensure the authority is adequately resourced in respect of its meetings and decisions while current vacancies are being filled.</P>

	<P>Under the Industrial Development Acts, support for job creation and investment on a regional or local basis comes within the remit of the industrial development agencies and I am precluded from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over another. IDA Ireland is the agency charged with the attraction of foreign investment to this country. The IDA has had considerable success in attracting FDI to north Dublin over the years and at the end of 2004, the last year for which figures are available, 23,420 people were employed in 251 IDA supported companies in north County Dublin, including the city. During 2005 four additional IDA supported companies announced the creation of more than 650 jobs in the following areas: Swords &mdash; Hartford Financial Group <Col N="1831"/>and Palm Global Operation; Eastpoint &mdash; Yahoo; and Blanchardstown &mdash; Qlogic.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland, EI, which has primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry, reported that at the end of 2004, 4,037 people were employed in 204 EI companies in Fingal and 24,998 in 1,115 EI companies in Dublin city. Since the beginning of 2005 EI has approved &euro;17.15 million and made payments of more than &euro;13.2 million to support development projects for indigenous companies in Fingal and Dublin city. The Fingal County Enterprise Board and the Dublin City Enterprise Board are responsible for the development of the micro-enterprise sector in the Fingal and Dublin city areas. Between January 2005 and the end of October 2005, the Fingal County Enterprise Board and the Dublin City Enterprise Board provided &euro;858,513 in grant assistance to 92 projects in the region.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has also invested significantly in community enterprise centres in the north of Dublin city to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation. Under the community enterprise centres urban scheme, centres were supported in Coolock, Darndale and the north city centre &mdash; the Liberty Corner enterprise centre. The Coolock and Darndale centres are occupied and construction of the Liberty Corner centre has just been completed. I am pleased that the strategies and policies being pursued by development agencies are producing real and sustainable results for the people of north Dublin city and county in terms of additional investments and jobs and I am confident this will continue to be the case in 2006 and beyond.</P>

	<P>There are three social welfare schemes providing pensions for older people old age contributory pension, retirement pension and old age non-contributory pension. In the case of the first two, these are contributory schemes payable at 66 and 65, respectively. People who receive old age contributory pension can work without restriction while those applying for retirement pension at age 65 must be retired from employment or self employment. Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than &euro;38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than &euro;3,174 per annum.</P>
        <P>However, given the improvements in life expectancy which have occurred in recent decades and the demographic changes our society will face in the years ahead, it is important that we should encourage and facilitate people who wish to have the choice of extending their working lives to remain active. As part of An Agreed <Col N="1833"/>Programme for Government, the Government is committed to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension.</P>
        <P>The old age non-contributory pension is different in nature from the contributory schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes, the old age non-contributory pension features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.</P>
        <P>The means test is continually kept under review and in June this year a change in the assessment of capital was introduced which allows for capital of &euro;20,000 to be disregarded when eligibility for old age pensions is being assessed. This figure is doubled in the case of pensioner couples.</P>
        <P>At present, people on non-contributory pensions can only earn up to &euro;7.60 per week without payment of their pension being affected. It is important that we also provide incentives and choices within the non-contributory scheme for older people to remain active in the workforce, if that is their wish.</P>
        <P>The very limited disregard which is available on earnings may act as a disincentive to people to continue working and, accordingly, I am at present examining the situation. Possible changes will be considered in a budgetary context, and in the overall context of social policy reforms.</P>

        <P>Since 1 May 2004, this scheme and other social assistance payments are subject to a statutory habitual residence test.</P>
        <P>The Dublin-mid-Leinster region of the executive has advised that the person concerned made an application for basic supplementary welfare allowance at the beginning of November 2005.

	<P>Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment.</P>
        <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase, and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme. For example, the standard rules governing rent supplement have been improved to ensure that a lone parent who takes up a community employment scheme place will be &euro;60 per week better off for having done so.</P>
        <P>People, including one-parent families, are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other secondary benefits in total or in part for the duration of the employment scheme, subject to certain conditions. Alternatively, they may qualify for secondary benefits under the standard rules of the scheme in question.</P>
        <P>For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of &euro;317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. People with incomes above this limit are assessed and may qualify under the standard rules of the rent or mortgage interest supplement schemes. No income limit applies to the back to work allowance itself.</P><Col N="1837"/>
        <P>While this rent supplement retention income limit has not changed since its introduction, significant other improvements have been made to the means test subsequently. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the &euro;317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</P>
        <P>Rent supplement may be retained for up to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% of supplement in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of &euro;317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable was abolished for people on the approved schemes. As a consequence many families retain more of their rent supplement than had been the case prior to these changes taking place.</P>
        <P>In effect, this means that people who commence employment through a back to work scheme or community employment, following a period of unemployment, can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the &euro;317.43 limit and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement.</P>
        <P>People availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules, and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the &euro;317.43 weekly limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. In that context, I introduced amending regulations in January 2005 to increase the income disregard in the standard rules of the scheme from &euro;50 to &euro;60 per week.</P>
        <P>Lone parents and others who participate in community employment, CE, are not penalised for doing so. Up to &euro;60 of weekly earnings is disregarded in the means test to ensure that a person is better off as a result of taking up a CE place, part-time employment or other such opportunities. There are also disregards for any family maintenance lone parents receive.</P>
        <P>For example, a lone parent living in Dublin with one child and rent of &euro;200 per week, whose sole income is a one-parent family payment of &euro;168.10 per week, would ordinarily receive rent supplement of &euro;184.50 per week, resulting in a net income after paying rent of &euro;152.60 per week. If she takes up a CE place her total income before rent supplement and before paying rent would rise to &euro;343.10 per week. In these circumstances, she would be entitled to &euro;69.50 in rent supplement and her income after paying rent would be &euro;212.60 per week. She would be &euro;60 <Col N="1838"/>better off for having taken up a CE place. Overall, I consider that the current rent supplement eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up back-to-work opportunities. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these arrangements is being considered further in the context of a policy review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which my Department is undertaking at present as part of its ongoing expenditure review programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
        <P>The rural transport initiative, RTI, is a pilot programme that has been operational since 2002. Under the initiative, funding is provided for 34 rural community organisations across the country to address the public transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services. I have provided &euro;4.5 million in funding for the RTI in 2005, which is a 50% increase on the provision for 2004.</P>
        <P>In line with the principal recommendation of the RTI appraisal in 2004, earlier this year I announced the extension of the pilot initiative to end 2006. I have also announced my intention to make the RTI permanent from 2007 onwards.</P>
        <P>Area Development Management Ltd., ADM, administers the RTI on behalf of my Department. Of the &euro;4.5 million allocated for the initiative in 2005, some &euro;350,000 is earmarked for administration and other non-operational costs incurred by ADM.</P>
        <P>With regard to administration costs at the group project level, I am conscious of the need to keep these as low as possible. I expressly addressed this issue when announcing the extension of the initiative to 2006, when I called on ADM to work closely with the pilot project <Col N="1840"/>groups to maximise the impact of the increased funding and to ensure continued value for money.</P>
        <P>However, ADM and the individual RTI project groups are solely responsible for operational aspects of the initiative at local level. Neither my Department nor I has any role in such matters.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I reject the suggestion that the major upgrading of public transport in the greater Dublin area contained in Transport 21 excludes Dublin&rsquo;s northside. The position is that the northside will gain significantly under Transport 21 as follows: Transport 21 provides for two new metro lines, metro north and metro west. Metro north will operate from St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green to Swords, serving places such as DCU, Ballymun and Dublin Airport. Metro west will be an orbital line linking the LUAS line at Tallaght with the metro north line at Ballymun and connecting Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown along its route.</P><Col N="1841"/>
        <P>The Tallaght Luas line will be extended from Connolly Station to the Docklands. A cross-city link will also be built to connect both the Tallaght and Sandyford lines in the city centre. This line will then be extended from the city centre via Broadstone, and serving the Grangegorman development area, to link with the Maynooth rail line at Liffey Junction.</P>
        <P>A city centre signalling project will be implemented. This will relieve congestion on the city centre rail network, allowing an extra four trains per hour to operate through the city centre. This will increase the number of trains per direction per hour from 12 to 16. The Navan rail line will be re-opened in two phases. Phase 1 will be a link from the city centre to Dunboyne and a new station in the docklands area. Phase 2 will see the line extended to Navan.</P>
        <P>A rail interconnector tunnel will be built by 2015. It will link the southwestern suburban line out of Heuston with the northern line. This project will relieve a severe bottleneck in the city centre rail network and permit a major expansion of the suburban rail service. With the interconnector in place, Transport 21 will deliver new DART services from the city centre to Balbriggan on the northern line and also new DART services to Maynooth. There will be a significant investment in new rolling stock to provide services on these lines.</P>
        <P>Under Transport 21 there will be a greater focus on the development of orbital, feeder and local services and integrating the city. The quality bus network will be at least doubled over the period to improve the quality, reliability and efficiency of the bus service. Buses will, in particular, be used to meet the immediate and short-term requirement for additional public transport in Dublin while other infrastructure is being put in place. I have asked Dublin Bus to review its network in light of the planned investment and to examine the most effective means of expanding bus services in the short, medium and long term and it is to report to me early in the new year. Overall we will see the capacity of the bus network increase by 60% over the lifetime of Transport 21. This will bring significant benefits to the north side of Dublin.</P>
        <P>Along with the public transport projects outlined, the M50 upgrade will be completed giving a 50% increase in its capacity. The port tunnel will also be completed thereby reducing the number of heavy goods vehicles travelling through the city centre. All in all Transport 21 will provide huge investment in new transport infrastructure and services right across the north side of Dublin. This is in addition to the large investment which has already been made which benefited the north side, including the doubling of DART capacity, increased suburban rail capacity and investments in buses and improved bus priority. With the implementation of Transport <Col N="1842"/>21, Dubliners living on the northside &mdash; whether in Ballymun or Ballybriggan, Swords or the city centre &mdash; will see a massively expanded and fully integrated public transport network offering attractive and frequent services and also offering choice between buses, Luas, metro, DART and suburban rail.</P>

Both parties were written to in this regard. The person named confirmed that he was not entitled to claim the <Col N="1843"/>parcel. This resulted in an area over-claim of 7.76 hectares or 56.52% of the eligible forage area found, 13.73 ha.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 to 190, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda records indicate that they responded on the date in question to two separate calls to the address referred to by the Deputy. On the first occasion, garda&iacute; were advised that the person referred to wished to discuss damage to their car. Garda&iacute; arrived on the scene within 37 minutes and remained with the caller for 23 minutes.</P>
        <P>I am also informed that garda&iacute; responded within two minutes to the second call, which indicated that criminal damage was being caused to the home and property of the person referred to in the question. Garda&iacute; remained at the scene with the person for 58 minutes. Neither response, therefore, took more than one hour. The Garda personnel from Leixlip Garda station who responded to these calls were deemed to be the most appropriate unit to deploy on that occasion.</P>
        <P>I understand the Garda authorities are currently carrying out an investigation into these incidents. I am further advised that there is no shortage of Garda evidence bags for collecting evidence from scenes. On the occasion in question, garda&iacute; were offered a bag by the person referred to. Garda&iacute; at the scene deemed it appropriate to accept this offer.</P>
        <P>I am advised that Garda management ensure that there is a prompt response to calls for Garda assistance and that there are sufficient resources available to respond to such calls. In the event of garda&iacute; availing of meal breaks, necessary arrangements are in place to ensure that appropriate personnel resources are available to respond to members of the public.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of all ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as at 7 November 2005 was 12,312.</P>
        <P>I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that due to the varied operational requirements of each Garda post throughout the country and the changing nature of operational deployments to meet varying operational needs, it is not possible to specify the total number of garda&iacute; required to staff each Garda post. The Garda authorities have calculated that a personnel commitment of 5.17 garda&iacute; is required to maintain a Garda presence at a post requiring 24 hour cover.</P>
        <P>Garda management states that Garda personnel are deployed in a variety of shift patterns in order to maximise the available resources during the periods of highest demand. Management also states that the number of Garda personnel on duty on any given day can vary, from day to day and location to location, according to the exigencies of the service.</P>

	<P>The fixed charge processing system is already operational in Dublin, Cork city and parts of Louth and Meath. The FCPS is currently integrated with the national driver file and the Courts Service.</P>
        <P>The system will be extended nationwide in respect of existing penalty point offences in conjunction with the commencement of an outsourced fixed charge payment collection service. In addition, it is proposed to rollout further penalty point offences under regulations under the Road Traffic Act 2002 which will be prepared by the Department of Transport in consultation with my Department. The precise timescales are currently being worked out with the various agencies involved but I can assure the Deputy there will be no unavoidable delay.</P>
        <P>The cost of the development of the fixed charge processing system is approximately &euro;13.5 million. This includes the cost of processing the output from speed cameras. In regard to the cost of implementing speed cameras, the selection of an outsource provider will be made by way of an open and competitive tendering process, and a request for tender document will issue in due course. In accordance with EU and national procurement guidelines, this RFT will be published in the <i>EU Journal</i> and on the Government&rsquo;s procurement website. All tender proposals received will be evaluated on an individual basis in accordance with the criteria set down in the request for tender. I am not in a position at this time to indicate to the Deputy the potential cost of the pro<Col N="1850"/>ject as this will depend, <i>inter alia,</i> on the tenders received.</P>
        <P>The cost of the development of the PULSE system was &euro;61.33 million. There is already an electronic interface between the fixed charge processing system and the Courts Service criminal case tracking system for the processing of summons applications. In regard to the integration of the courts computer system with PULSE, my Department, the Courts Service and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are currently engaged with the Reach Agency in a pilot project to exchange summons and court outcomes electronically, by implementing the Reach InterAgency Messaging Service. On successful completion of this pilot project, other exchanges of information between these agencies and others in the sector will be revisited, potentially leading to a fuller integration between the two systems, depending on the business benefits to be identified. The costs for this project have not yet been finalised.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Garda management states that there are currently 581 students undergoing training at the Garda College in Templemore. There have been four intakes of 275 Garda recruits per intake so far this year. There are currently 549 recruits at phase II of their training. This means that a total of 1,130 Garda recruits are in training at present.</P>
        <P>The current student-probationer education, training and development programme course consists of five separate but integrated phases. Phase I &mdash; 20 weeks &mdash; phase III &mdash; 16 weeks &mdash; and phase V &mdash; four weeks &mdash; of the training programme are conducted at the Garda College with the exception of the final four weeks of phase III which are delivered at operational training stations. Phase II &mdash; 22 weeks &mdash; and phase IV &mdash; 38 weeks &mdash; are conducted at designated operational training stations. Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase III of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees become serving members of the force. <Col N="1852"/>Formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training.</P>
        <P>I might add that the accelerated recruitment campaign of 1,100 Garda recruits each year to reach a force strength of 14,000, in line with the commitment in an Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be fully considered.</P>

        <P>An application for family re-unification, under section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996, was received in my Department in February 2005, in respect of the person concerned and her daughter lodged by their legal representative. The application was forwarded to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner in March 2005 for investigation as required under the Act. That office advised my Department that, despite three questionnaires and other correspondence having been issued to the refugee who made the application and to her legal representative, no reply has been received to date.</P>
        <P>The commissioner has now written to the refugee at the address provided by the Deputy. On receipt of the completed questionnaire, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner will complete its investigations and forward a report on same to my Department. As soon as a decision is made, I will inform both the refugee and the Deputy.</P>

        <P>However, I understand that the Deputy was advised on a number of occasions, most recently in September 2005, by officials in the general immigration section that the person concerned should apply for permission to remain in the State based on his marriage to an Irish national. It appears that the individual concerned has not done so to-date and since he currently has permission to remain in the State, he is leaving himself open to possible deportation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of garda&iacute; currently suspended is 27 across all ranks, which represents about 0.2% of the force. Of these 27 members, the vast majority, 23 members, are suspended for a year or less. Four members are suspended for considerably longer periods.</P>
        <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment upon the nature of any of these suspensions as each suspension history is unique and deliberated on a case-by-case basis. In some cases disciplinary investigations are ongoing, while in others, matters are currently either before the High Court on judicial proceedings, awaiting a determination on criminal charges or awaiting instructions from the law officers.</P>
        <P>A special suspension allowance of 75% of basic pay and rent allowance is payable to suspended garda&iacute; in lieu of full pay and allowances during the period of suspension. A suspended member may apply to the Commissioner on grounds of special hardship to have the suspension allowance increased to 90%. The total money paid to the 27 suspended garda&iacute; up to 3 November 2005 was &euro;1,301,527.82.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have expressed concerns regarding the significant delays in certain disciplinary cases within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. <Col N="1856"/>I am very concerned that lengthy court proceedings lie behind the four cases of lengthy suspension, and I am examining whether strict maximum time limits for suspension can be introduced in statutory regulations. I asked the Garda Commissioner to furnish me with a report outlining what steps have been taken in the management of these cases to resolve, one way or another, the legal proceedings which have prevented the completion of the disciplinary process. I also asked the Commissioner for his views on how best to ensure, as far as possible, that significant delays are avoided in future disciplinary cases. I have just received a report from the Garda Commissioner in the above matter. I will now carefully study this report and consider what steps need to be taken to address this issue of concern.</P>

	<P>The person in question made an application for permission to remain in the State based on marriage to an Irish national. A request for documentation to enable the further processing of the application issued on 29 September 2005. A reply was received but did not include documentary evidence that the person in question is residing in the same household as her Irish national spouse. A further request issued on 26 October 2005 requesting this information. It is expected that on receipt of the information requested the case will be finalised within a short period of time. However, it should be noted that marriage to an Irish national does not confer an automatic right of residence in the State.</P>

	<P>The level of funding that the Department of Education and Science provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;nghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.</P><Col N="1857"/>
        <P>However, following discussions with Educate Together the Department of Education and Science has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The amount provided in 2005 was &euro;81,133. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Education Act, 1998, I, as Minister, am obliged to have regard to the need to reflect the diversity of educational services provided in the State. Applying this provision to the development of multi-denominational education, at primary level, the Department of Education and Science has supported the establishment of a significant number of new multi-denominational schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years alone, 12 are multi-denominational. At post-primary level, the requirement for multi-denominational education is met by the State sector through non-designated vocational education committee schools.</P>
        <P>To underpin the establishment of new schools, the Department of Education and Science has made a number of changes in recent years which have assisted patron bodies in the provision of accommodation. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by the patron body for multi-denominational schools, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,000 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much more quickly, such as in the case of the new multi-denominational school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in less than 13 months.</P>
        <P>Many multi-denominational primary schools are established in areas of rapidly expanding population growth. School building projects in these areas are assigned a band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects. This is the highest band rating possible which results in the delivery of permanent accommodation in the shortest timeframe achievable.</P>
        <P>These measures are a strong indication of the Department&rsquo;s commitment to supporting an educational diversity agenda, including multi-denominational education provision. It will continue to do so as part of its own statutory obligations and in the context of the national development plan which is structured to support the development of all educational sectors regardless of ethos.</P>

        <P>He subsequently undertook a course involving the European computer driving licence, for which there were no course or examination fees, and an evening course to train participants to teach computer studies, which was called the joint education board, JEB. This programme was part of City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee, CDVEC, self-financing evening programmes. CDVEC has discretion to waive fees for such courses and did so in his case. However, as he was unsuccessful in the examinations, he repeated the course the following year. Fees were payable for this. Inquiries have been made with the CDVEC which has advised that funds will not be made available for a repeat year for the JEB programme.</P>

	<P>Social personal and health education, SPHE, incorporating relationships and sexuality education has been developed at junior cycle level, and this has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for (a) junior cycle and (b) senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are: to foster the personal development, health and well-being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</P>
        <P>The SPHE modules at junior cycle in post primary schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision-making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy. Two of the SPHE modules relate specifically to relationships and sexuality and personal safety. The aims of these modules include bringing students to an understanding of the physical changes that take place during adolescence and exploring with them procedures for protecting their personal safety along with appropriate responses when their safety is threatened. In third year, an awareness of help agencies is promoted and students&rsquo; skills for obtaining access to them are developed.</P>
        <P>For senior cycle students, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education <Col N="1862"/>programme in place. The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues, including pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and accepting sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently developing an SPHE curriculum framework for senior cycle and a draft document has recently gone for consultation to the partners. The draft curriculum framework includes five areas of learning, most of which contribute to the education of young people on aspects of violence, its causes and preventive measures and to the promotion of physical and mental health. The five areas are mental health, gender studies, substance use, relationship and sexuality education, and physical activity and nutrition.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has developed two sets of resource materials that are particularly relevant to this area for use with transition year and senior cycle students as part of an SPHE programme. These are BALANCE &mdash; Who cares? and Exploring Masculinities. These resources use a variety of materials and strategies to explore and discuss issues of gender equality. Specific attention is paid to addressing both sexual harassment and domestic violence in both resources. Also included in the Exploring Masculinities resources are materials on bullying and child sexual abuse.</P>
        <P>All post-primary schools provide a guidance and counselling service for their students and they receive ex-quota hours from the Department for this provision. Guidance counsellors are qualified to provide counselling support to students who may have suffered abuse and to assist them in accessing appropriate help when needed.</P>

	<P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding allocated to second level schools in recent years. Not only have voluntary secondary schools benefitted from the <Col N="1865"/>increases in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant, which stands at &euro;286 per pupil since last January, but they have also gained from the introduction of grants under the school services support initiative. The standard support services grant, which was increased to &euro;103 from January 2005, was increased further to &euro;145 per pupil in the case of voluntary secondary schools. The increased grant of &euro;42 per pupil is paid in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to &euro;15,554, or &euro;44.44 per pupil, per annum which have been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by the Department of Education and Science on an annual basis, in accordance with generally applied rules relating to recognised pupil enrolment. In general, a ratio of 18:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on established junior certificate, leaving certificate, repeat leaving certificate and transition year programmes and a ratio of 16:1 is applied in respect of recognised pupils on the leaving certificate vocational programme, post-leaving certificate courses and the applied leaving certificate programme. There have been significant improvements in the pupil teacher ratio at post-primary level in recent years. There was one teacher for every 16 pupils in the 1997-98 school year, but that ratio decreased to 13.4:1 in the 2004-05 school year.</P>
        <P>Enormous progress has been made in recent years to increase the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs. At second level, there are 1,614 whole time equivalent teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. By contrast, there were 558 teachers in place in the 2001-02 school year for such pupils. In addition, some 1,023 whole time equivalent special needs assistants are in our second level schools at present, compared to 292 in the 2001-02 school year.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build on a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. At second level, the new standardised system for identifying disadvantage in schools will replace all the existing arrangements for targeting schools for participation in initiatives aimed at addressing disadvantage. As a result, the 150 second level schools which will be included in the new school support programme will benefit from additional staffing and funding supports, including increased funding under the <Col N="1866"/>school book grant scheme, access to home school community liaison scheme services and access to a range of academic and non-academic supports to retain young people in school. Such measures will be extended to second level schools in the school support programme on a phased basis. The significant increases in the funding of post-primary schools represent a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritising the available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved each year by the Department of Education and Science in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its timetable and subject options with regard to pupil needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. As long as it meets requirements relating to the provision of core subjects, the curriculum offered in individual second level schools is a matter for each school&rsquo;s authorities, having regard to its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that if a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments from within its approved allocation, the Department will consider applications for additional short-term support, for example in the form of curricular concessions. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</P>
        <P>The Department allocates additional teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special educational needs. Since 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special educational needs organisers, is responsible for processing applications for additional special educational needs resources. When a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local organiser for additional teaching support or special needs assistant support for the pupil. I am confident that the advent of the national council will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for second level schools in <Col N="1867"/>recent years.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 221 together.</P>
        <P>Schools catering for non-national pupils who have significant English language deficits are entitled to assistance to enable such pupils to gain full access to the curriculum. Primary schools in which between three and 13 non-English speaking non-national pupils are enrolled receive grant assistance for a period of up to two years. Primary schools with between three and eight such pupils receive grant assistance of &euro;6,348.69 while schools with between nine and 13 such pupils receive assistance of &euro;9,523.04. Schools which have between 14 and 27 such pupils enrolled are entitled to a full-time temporary language support teaching post at primary level. Schools with <Col N="1868"/>28 or more such pupils are entitled to two full-time temporary language support teachers. Support is provided for an individual pupil for a period of up to two years. A third teaching post may be sanctioned in exceptional cases, following consideration by the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s inspectorate. The school referred to by the Deputy has three language support teaching posts, as well as 33 mainstream teachers, five permanent learning support or resource teachers, two temporary learning support or resource teachers and a resource teacher for Travellers. Based on an enrolment of 936 pupils on 30 September 2005, the pupil teacher ratio, excluding the three additional language support teachers, is approximately 23:1. I am satisfied that the staffing of the school is sufficient to meet the needs of all pupils in the school, including non-national pupils.</P>

	<P>Assessment of air quality is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and air quality management is a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data under the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002. The EPA&rsquo;s, Air Quality and Emissions to Air Report 2003, contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality, and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA and local authorities. The report states that the limit values for pollutants under the EU directives on ambient air quality were not exceeded in 2003. The report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>EC Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and management of environmental noise defines a common approach to noise pollution across the EU so as to avoid, prevent or reduce the harmful effects of exposure to environmental noise. This will be achieved through a process of noise mapping which will apply to agglomerations and to new and existing major roads, railways and airports, as set out in the directive, in two phases; the first phase by June 2007 and the second phase by June 2012. I understand the M50 motorway will fall within the directive&rsquo;s definition of a first phase major road.</P>
        <P>The directive aims to ensure the public has access to information on environmental noise obtained from the noise mapping process. Furthermore, it provides for the formulation and adoption of action plans based on the noise mapping results, with a view to preventing and reducing environmental noise where necessary. Action planning shall also proceed on a phased basis; the first phase by July 2008 and the second phase by July 2012. Regulations to transpose Directive 2002/49/EC are at an advanced stage of drafting and I intend to make them shortly.</P>
        <P>While the Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme, implementation of individual projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority in conjunction with the relevant local authority. In this regard, I understand the National Roads Authority published, Guidelines for the Treatment of Noise and Vibration in National Road Schemes in 2004. These guidelines establish a more demanding design goal in regard to road traffic noise, and provide detailed guidance on the treatment of noise and vibration at all stages in the planning, design and construction of road projects. I am satisfied that existing and forthcoming provisions for which I have responsibility have been designed to address the main problems associated with motorway noise and air pollution.</P>

In July 2004, my Department concluded an agreement with the farming pillar under Sustaining Progress which involved increases in the standard rates of payment. This agreement incorporated retrospective provisions benefiting landowners who participated in the original 1999 scheme. In calculating the amounts payable, the value of the previous payments per acre is adjusted in accordance with the consumer price index. This is consistent with the terms of assurances given in writing to many landowners at the time of their previous payments.</P>
