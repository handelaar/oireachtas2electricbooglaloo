      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet committee on social inclusion last met on 27 April 2005. The next meeting of the committee is scheduled for tomorrow, 29 June.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs reviewed the report of the national drugs strategy mid-term review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise out of this very specific statistical question. There is no space for supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Ceann Comhairle going to close us down completely?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are questions on Northern Ireland, so the Deputy should not take up time on irrelevant questions</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the importance of that. Nevertheless I am trying to establish whether the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs has addressed the report of the national drugs strategy mid-term review. It is a very straightforward question and I thought it would have been accommodated. It is not outside the scope of the question.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="386"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is definitely outside the scope and if the Deputy wants information in this regard he should submit a question to the appropriate line Minister. It is not appropriate to have a debate on what was discussed or on any particular issue which is the not the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to outline whether the committee has or will address the report? I will leave it at that because I have no intention to retrace this line of argument. Unfortunately, there is no end to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer to the question is yes, the committee is addressing that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Questions like these about Cabinet sub-committee meetings have been the traditional method used to permit the head of Government to answer broad questions such as those posed by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. The Ceann Comhairle has constantly, persistently and consistently narrowed the scope of questions that this House might legitimately put to the Taoiseach to such a point that it is not worth our while standing up to ask a question anymore. Therefore, I do not propose to ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy. I believe that these questions, which are statistical, should not be posed for oral answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not statistical questions. That clich&eacute; has come into parliamentary exchanges because of questions habitually posed under the rubric of the Central Statistics Office and other statistical matters. A question about drug abuse and a Cabinet meeting is not statistical in nature.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question is as follows: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach when the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs last met; and when the next meeting will be held&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That question is in line with parliamentary convention and aims to ascertain if, arising from the meeting, any decisions were reached or general policy announcements are to be made by the Taoiseach. He is the head of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware that policy questions should be addressed to the line Minister. The Chair does not want to be involved in this type of discussion every day that questions such as these are posed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If we accept that the position is so, what is the point in posing a question to the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy about putting down a question of this nature for oral answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="387"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Ceann Comhairle suggest, on the matter of drugs policy that effects so many people in our communities, how we might draft an appropriate question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you are missing the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not missing the point. You do not want the Taoiseach to answer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The question should be drafted for the line Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>You want to narrow the scope of the questions that we can put to the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on the matter in accordance with precedent. Questions on policy are addressed to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Ceann Comhairle will consider that my question is in order. To take 45 minutes to ask the Taoiseach when the committee last met is not a good use of parliamentary time. The limitations on party leaders or anyone else asking the Taoiseach a question are so strict that we are forced to ask questions about when the committee last met. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to bear in mind that we are attempting to address important issues here, not simply fill a calendar or inquire about diary entries. Will the Chair countenance the question that I propose to ask, namely, whether the Taoiseach accepts that the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs should meet more frequently, given that there is growing inequality in the pathways to social inclusion? CORI published a report last month which clearly indicates that one quarter of Irish children and over one fifth of Irish people are at risk of poverty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I also ask about equality as it relates to people with disabilities because 16% of the complaints made to the Equality Authority were from people with disability. Such facts indicate that the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs needs to meet more regularly and needs to be more public and more effective in responding to these growing problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee meets on a monthly basis. I do not know if this is helpful to Deputies, but if direct questions are posed about any of these issues, the Ministers who report to the committee would be only too glad to answer them. When I was on the other side of the House and Deputy Rabbitte was on this side, he used to take part of the time allocated to Taoiseach&rsquo;s questions to answer these types of questions and I posed questions directly to him. Unfortunately, that does not happen now and if Deputies really <Col N="388"/>want answers, they should revert to the old system, which worked very well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It worked well because Deputy Rabbitte always gave full information in response to questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I could do so too because I attend the committee meetings, but that is not the point. Procedurally that is how it should be operated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government changed that procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no change. It can still be done and there is no problem in doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of today&rsquo;s report on the national survey of drug-related suicides and the significant increase which has taken place in recent years, and given that serious drug abuse is a feature of national life rather than of urban life&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is straying into policy which is a matter for the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Taoiseach consider making the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs strategy and housing solely responsible for drugs strategy because of the extent of the problem?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is responsible for all actions in the drugs area. He is also responsible for housing because in many of these areas there is a cross-link between the difficulties and problems. Research shows that these areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in health and so on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The health aspect is different, being concerned with treatment centres. I do not think it would be a good idea for the Minister of State to take on the additional responsibility of the health aspect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I met Dr. Paisley and senior representatives of the DUP on 15 June in the Irish Embassy in London. The meeting was the first chance to meet the DUP since its success in the UK elections. We had a good, comprehensive discussion about the current political situation. The DUP knows that the Good Friday Agreement is the centrepiece of the Irish Government&rsquo;s policy. We reiterated our view that the only way forward is for people to share power on the basis of equality and a commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic methods. That is also the view of the British Government. To move forward, we need a clear, unambiguous end to all paramilitary and criminal activity and the completion of decommissioning.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>Dr. Paisley made it clear that he is only interested in actions, not just words, and the Irish Government shares that view. I assured Dr. Paisley and his colleagues that we also want the IRA response to be conclusive and decisive. We also said to the DUP that if we see the actions that are required, both Governments will expect Unionists to participate in fully inclusive partnership politics in Northern Ireland, recognising that regaining confidence and trust will inevitably take some time. We also talked about the importance of everybody in the community working together to ensure we have a peaceful summer.</P>
        <P>I had a separate meeting with Prime Minister Blair on the same day. This was our first opportunity to meet in person since the British general election. We reviewed our respective contacts with the political parties, including my meeting earlier in the day with the DUP. We reaffirmed our shared position that full implementation of the Agreement is the way forward and that to get to that point, we need to see a complete end to paramilitary and criminal activity and the completion of decommissioning.</P>
        <P>I met the Prime Minister again yesterday when we jointly chaired the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC. This was the first meeting of the conference at summit level since 1999. The meeting was the first comprehensive engagement between the two Governments on Northern Ireland since the British general election in May. I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, together with other Ministers for Northern Ireland participated on the British side.</P>
        <P>We discussed a range of issues, including political developments, security and criminal justice, policing, the marching season, human rights and North-South co-operation. I also raised the Dublin-Monaghan bombings with the Prime Minister.</P>
        <P>The joint communiqu&eacute; which was issued after the conference outlines in greater detail the issues we discussed. A copy of this communiqu&eacute; has been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The two Governments will continue to remain in close contact over the coming period. The Government also remains in contact with the other parties in Northern Ireland. I met the Alliance Party in January and I am happy to have meetings with parties as the need arises. In this context, I reiterate my congratulations to Sir Reg Empey as the new leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. I hope that we will have the opportunity to meet shortly.</P>
        <P>As Deputies may know, I was in Belfast last week at the ICTU conference. I do not have definite plans to visit Northern Ireland again in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that it is now three months since Mr. Gerry Adams made his statement to the IRA, has the Government any factual information on when a definitive response from the <Col N="391"/>IRA can be expected? Given that the impact is that everything else is on hold awaiting the IRA&rsquo;s response, does the Taoiseach acknowledge how frustrating this is for the democratic parties which cannot proceed with normal business until we have the IRA statement? Will he outline the minimum requirement of the two Governments in terms of what they are demanding from the IRA and what is their bottom line in respect of any statement considered to be imminent? Does he understand the extent to which many members of the public are repelled by statements, most latterly attributed to himself, that the IRA should become some kind of commemorative organisation and the implications of such a statement in terms of the 1,700 odd murdered by the IRA? What would be the reaction of the Nationalist people if we had similar statements about loyalist paramilitary organisations reconstituting themselves as some kind of commemorative organisations? Does the Taoiseach agree the demoractic parties and the two Governments ought not be a party to the rewriting of history that seeks to paint either the loyalists gangs or the IRA as having been involved in anything but a vicious sectarian conflict and that any attempt to rewrite this is repulsive to the average citizen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first question on the date we expect to hear a response, frankly, I do not know the answer. The two Governments expect to hear a response over the summer. We expect to hear one in the weeks immediately ahead prior to the holiday break in August. That is what we believe, although we do not have any definite information. As I said previously, if that is not adhered to, I will regret that fact but it is not the biggest issue; the biggest issue is that when we receive a response, we get the right one. That is still my position. It would help everybody if we could remove the uncertainty. I welcome the fact that all over the island of Ireland there has been a meeting of people &mdash; we know this from security intelligence sources and otherwise &mdash; who have been involved in Provisional IRA activities during the years. That they are debating this issue is good and I hope we will get the right answer from them.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question of what is our minimum and maximum position, there is no difference in this regard. We have made it clear since last autumn and long before &mdash; since October 2001, the first time we spelled it out in a document, and the position has not changed much &mdash; that we want an unambiguous end to all paramilitary and criminal activity. This means a full end to paramilitary activity with clear instructions that those involved in these activities cease. That was set out very well in paragaph 13 of the document issued a few years ago which defines what it means and all the categories covered. I would not add to or substract from the list. The only change over the period was that in addition to paramilitary activity we included criminal <Col N="392"/>activity. The Deputy knows the reason we inserted that term. The end of criminal acitvity means the end of all such acitivty. I do not believe there can be big and small criminal activities.</P>
        <P>With regard to the completion of decommissioning, it seems to the two Governments that continuing with incremental decommissioning will not resolve the problems. It was useful at the start as a confidence-building measure but that did not last too long. General John de Chastelain must be totally and absolutely happy in this regard. He is accepted on all sides &mdash; we had this discussion recently &mdash; as being in a position to make an authoritive declaration on the matter. Neither Prime Minister Blair nor I want to get into discussion with him on it, one way or another. It is a matter for him to be satisfied and to make his assessment based on the logistical information that we know is in his possession. Anything other than that, as the Deputy correctly said, will not allow us to move on and deal with the political agenda. That agenda will have its own difficulties and problems. We cannot get on with that, however, until we get these answers.</P>
        <P>If this does not happen, as I have said to other parties in recent months, there is not much point in asking further because we know what the answers will be. In the event, the stalemate will continue into the dim and distant future. I have been very clear on that in all meetings with the various parties since last September.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s third question, nobody has suggested to me what the IRA as a group will do, if we can move it to a peaceful mode in which paramilitary activity, violence and criminal related activities are over. I have talked about this to many people in Northern Ireland, including the Unionist political parties. It was Mr. David Trimble as leader of the Ulster Unionist Party who said that a commemorative organisation was something that would be acceptable to him.</P>
        <P>If they believe that they should commemorate those who have died, who have been colleagues over the years, whatever their activities, I am certainly not going to condemn that. Neither do I condemn the fact that the Red Hand Commandos, the UVF, the UDA and other paramilitary organisations engage in such activities. To say they will all go away and never be involved in such activities any more is just not dealing with the real world, because they will. To try to say they should not commemorate somebody who has been killed or was a colleague is not to live in the real world. Our line is that as long as we are finished with arms, criminality, paramilitary trappings and all those matters, we will have brought an end to that which we have sought to end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Taoiseach understands the difference between retired paramilitaries choosing to commemorate whomsoever they want is quite distinct from democratically elected Governments conferring approval on a <Col N="393"/>particular version of history. In the sectarian slaughter that we have witnessed over the last 30 years, more people were killed by the IRA than by the Black and Tans. It is a matter of concern to a great many citizens that we should seek to confer some type of approval or be complicit in the re-writing of history.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach had any response to his representations on behalf of the Shankill bomber, Sean Kelly? Will he explain to the House why he decided to take up the cudgels in respect of that case? To my knowledge, he has not made representations in respect of any person returned to prison, so why has he done it in that case?</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the comments by the SDLP MLA, Dr. Se&aacute;n Farren, about events at the Orange parade in Ballymena last night and the policing of same by the PSNI? Has he or does he intend to make representations to the British Government or to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in respect of the incidents that occurred at Ballymena?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on the first point. Nobody is suggesting that anybody is giving recognition. However, the reality must be acknowledged, as well. We are trying to end paramilitary activity and criminality and complete decommissioning. We do not want to embark on the next round of trying to end something that is clearly impossible to finish. This does not mean, however, that these organisations have any type of official support. The reality is that one cannot go through Northern Ireland without passing places where the UVF and others were in 1912 or were trained in 1916. Neither the Deputy nor I has respect for any of these activities or all the atrocities over the years. To ask me not alone to try to end paramilitary and criminal activity and bring decommissioning to a conclusion but to disband organisations so that their members will never meet again is to seek the impossible and I have made that clear to groups. I do not see the day when we will all be there commemorating anything that anyone did. That will not happen at any time in the next century, not to mind in the short term.</P>
        <P>On the Kelly case, this was only the second case of a licence being suspended. Whenever these cases come up on either side we always ask questions and play an even-handed role. I have raised the cases of loyalist prisoners and fought on behalf of the father of the loyalist leader killed in prison whose name escapes me.</P>

	<P>Billy Wright.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I raised that case time and again. I met Billy Wright&rsquo;s father and I always played my part in the case.</P>
        <P>With regard to the case of Mr. Kelly, we knew, from our people, that he was involved in the marching season last year when he was quite helpful in de-escalating trouble on the streets. The British side says it has information that he <Col N="394"/>had broken his licence. We cannot make a judgment on that and the case will go to the appeals commission. All we said was that if this is the process, we accept it &mdash; there have been very few such cases &mdash; and the quicker it is dealt with, the better. Last year, Mr. Kelly was definitely involved in playing a constructive role in very difficult situations about which we were well aware. As to what he was doing during the winter season, I am not in a position to make a judgment.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate, marches have taken place practically every day for the past few weeks. It is a difficult issue and we are trying to be as constructive and helpful as possible in trying to deal with difficult situations, whether the tour of the north march ten days ago, the Whiterock parade, which was on Saturday, the mini-12th celebration, which will take place in east Belfast this Friday night, Portadown, the Drumcree parade, which is coming up on 10 July, tensions around the neighbouring town of Lurgan or concern about parades through Nationalist areas of Ballymena, such as the Orange march on 27 June mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, about which Se&aacute;n Farren said the police had been heavy-handed in dealing with Nationalist protestors. I want to be very even-handed about this issue. There are all kinds of tensions and difficulties around many of the parades this year, for all the obvious reasons, including the Derry parade which I mentioned recently. We are trying to help all sides.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, apart from the formal meeting, we had meetings with British officials. We are doing our best to try to reduce tensions around parades. Every word uttered in the House during these debates is read by all sides. We are trying to be even-handed with regard to all the marches, including those I did not mention, whether by the Orange Order, provisional republicans or any of the loyalist groups. What we, in the House, are trying to do is help to get through a difficult marching season.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Taoiseach surprised at the security briefings from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Army as to the estimated strength of IRA personnel at the moment? Newspaper reports indicate a strength of 1,500, around 20% of regular Army numbers here. Does the Taoiseach have evidence about how many are in the Republic compared with Northern Ireland? Was he surprised at the statement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the numbers estimated to be active personnel in the IRA? Does the Taoiseach believe the evidence from the International Monitoring Commission that the IRA is regrouping, actively purchasing arms and training personnel in military style operations?</P>
        <P>After the breakdown in talks, the McCartney murder and the Northern Bank raid, the Taoiseach had an acrimonious meeting with the president of Sinn F&eacute;in in Dublin. He sent away <Col N="395"/>Sinn F&eacute;in with a flea in its ear to talk to the IRA and to come back to the Irish Government with a clear statement of the IRA&rsquo;s intentions. The Taoiseach is entitled to keep dialogue between parties open but there are newspaper reports that the Taoiseach has had meetings with the president of Sinn F&eacute;in on his own, in secret, and that no one knows what was discussed at these meetings. Can the Taoiseach confirm there were no side deals made about on-the-run prisoners or people in Colombia? What where these meetings about? Why were they necessary in the first place if the Taoiseach had made clear his position and that of the Government that the onus and responsibility rests clearly with the IRA to make up its mind about what it wants to do? In future, as Mitchell Reiss said to me in Washington, there will be no more constructive ambiguity and words will mean what they are supposed to mean and everyone will know what is intended. Everyone here wants an end to paramilitary and criminal activity once and for all. Can the Taoiseach explain what went on at these meetings and why were they necessary?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach believe this situation will continue to drag until assembly elections take place again for the political reasons of various groups? Will the assembly be up and running before elections are again called?</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach had any security briefings on the disappeared and where their remains might be located, still a source of great sensitivity to those involved?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no new information on the disappeared but we continue to engage with any information there is. Sites that have not been checked previously are always kept under review. If the information is sufficiently detailed and specific enough to do something, it is checked.</P>
        <P>On the number of volunteers, I do not have any real oversight of this. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform receives security reports and he bases his information on intelligence mainly from the Garda but also from the Army. There are meetings a few times a year with the Garda when there are security issues such as the Northern Bank raid but normally I do not make a point of it. Anything the Minister would say would be based on that information and that is the position given by the Garda. Regarding the meetings, I accept what Deputy Kenny has said and that he is under some pressure because people have raised the issue with him. I appreciate the bipartisan approach to these matters and Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s recent letter on the issue. I have no argument with the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I will reiterate what I stated recently. Following the public meeting the Government had with Sinn F&eacute;in after January, I made it clear there was no issue about us seeking to engage with the party. We asked Sinn F&eacute;in to go away and let us know what was happening. However, because of <Col N="396"/>the wider peace process, we did not stop engagement.</P>
        <P>From 8 December until the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period, other than the meeting that happened after 8 December and the meeting to which the Deputy referred, we did not have another meeting or engagement &mdash; hardly even a telephone call. It was then that I spoke to the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in and then met him in Washington. This was a short meeting between myself, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and Mr. Adams and Rita O&rsquo;Hare. We reiterated our position from two months previously. Mr. Adams, as president of Sinn F&eacute;in, then issued his statement.</P>
        <P>On three subsequent occasions, before, during and after the UK general election, I had three further short meetings with Sinn F&eacute;in. None of these was secret. I said publicly that I met the party. These meetings were mainly around two issues. One was the issue of us being clear about what we expected so that we could move forward. The other concerned the ongoing issue of the marching season and how we would work through it.</P>
        <P>Many of the contacts we have had over the years on these issues are important and ensure we get through issues and events. It is not always understood the amount of contact that goes on during the marching season in attempts to get people on all sides to communicate. Otherwise events can easily get out control. Not only in this Government but with previous Governments, people, including myself, have gone to the trouble of meeting loyalists and others, sometimes privately. However, none of these meetings was in any way secret. There was no question of us talking about side negotiations or deals in written or other form. Such a request was never made to me. I was not asked in any of these meetings to make any such issue. These meetings simply concerned our ongoing business.</P>
        <P>While I stated we would not engage with Sinn F&eacute;in, not to do so at all would be dangerous. It does not make any sense, particularly when the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, has met Sinn F&eacute;in. The US envoy has met the president and other members of Sinn F&eacute;in. For the Government not to do so would be irresponsible. We must keep up the ongoing contact and dialogue. I hope that position is absolutely clear. I will answer Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s letter.</P>
        <P>Regarding the assembly elections, I honestly hope that over the summer we will get a satisfactory conclusion of the issues to which I referred. In the months &mdash; not weeks &mdash; ahead, although I hope it is not too long a period, we can begin the process of engaging to build the confidence of the Democratic Unionist Party and Unionism generally to return to the position we were in some years ago. This will not be easy and will not happen overnight or in a few months. However, we must try to do so. The question has arisen as to whether one can get to that position with the assembly of November 2003, or if it will require fresh elections. From a purely technical or legal <Col N="397"/>perspective, I do not see why one must change that position. Perhaps it will become clear to people, who will state that elections are needed. At present however, that is not an issue. It is another question as to whether it becomes an issue at some point in the next year. I do not see why it should, but no doubt others will state that it definitely will do so. It remains to be seen. However, before we reach that point, two major steps must take place or no further steps will take place. These issues must be answered in the short term &mdash; I have not put a date on it but they must be dealt with &mdash; and then we will move to the next phase, which will be to try to build trust and confidence and to return to establishing the executive. Hopefully, this can be done in the months ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The joint communiqu&eacute; contains a number of items, but the one with which I am concerned states the Irish Government raised its concerns regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Has the Taoiseach proceeded to discuss the possibility of a court case in the European Court of Human Rights with the Attorney General and what progress has been made in that regard? Does the Taoiseach have any indication as to when he expects a statement from the IRA? Can he inform Members what benchmarks the Government might have considered as to how the IRA&rsquo;s intent is to be analysed? I do not have time to go into them, but apart from declaring an end to paramilitary and criminal activity, will the Taoiseach seek a cessation of recruitment for example? He might indicate whether benchmarks have been considered. Finally, over the summer, will any thought be given to reappraising the approach of the Government? As far as I can tell, it has not changed since the time when unionism was predominantly pro-Agreement. Now that unionism is mainly anti-Agreement, does the situation not require a re-evaluation of the approach to the implementation of the Agreement and will the Taoiseach involve the Opposition parties in re-appraising that approach, so we can have a more rounded approach, rather than a unilateral one from the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings there was an indication, as I understand it, on the part of the British Prime Minister in the course of that meeting that the British were willing to look at the issue again but had no evidence of collusion as things stand. This so-called re-examination is without any time restriction. Should we not move ahead with the European Court of Human Rights case option without further delay? Regarding the arrest of Sean Kelly, does the Taoiseach share my concern at the reaction of many ex-Republican prisoners? The reaction to his re-arrest and re-incarceration was one of alarm, particularly as they have played such an important role in ensuring the diffusion of what can only be described as increased ten<Col N="398"/>sion in interface locations, particularly in the city of Belfast.</P>

	<P>Was the response from the British Prime Minister positive?

	<P>Deputy Sargent again asked me about the date. As I said, I do not have a date nor am I as concerned about one as making sufficient progress on the issues which are important. Obviously, I hope it will not be a long period. I have already acknowledged the role of Sean Kelly, of which we are aware. I hope the case will pass through the appeals commission very quickly and that the issue will be dealt with there. I will check the position of Christy McGrath. The issue has been pursued by the secretariat.</P><Col N="399"/>
        <P>All the Deputies asked about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Yesterday I outlined the position as we all see it simply and succinctly. I stated that we felt we had not got information we had specifically sought and that there was an overwhelming view that there had been collusion at some levels, of which we can never be certain because of the time span. It is, however, the belief that that is the case.</P>
        <P>In particular, I have raised the issue of what we understood to be a commitment given at Weston Park a number of years ago for a Cory-like inquiry. I reiterated that the Oireachtas committee had unanimously called for such an inquiry. I indicated that in the absence of progress, we would have to examine the possibility of pursing the case before the European Court of Human Rights, as recommended by the Oireachtas committee. I stated that I had persistently made this point to the Oireachtas committee and it was not something on which I would go back.</P>
        <P>The Prime Minister asked me some questions on the history which I answered very clearly. The British contend that they can find no evidence of collusion in the bombings but have said they feel some of the questions asked by the Oireachtas committee and the Government have not been precise in respect of particular periods and that we should raise this with them. I have no problem doing so but I am not prepared to stop on that basis because I agree with Deputy Costello in that I saw the reply to the Oireachtas committee and one would be no wiser after reading it than before. As I indicated previously, I intend, on a preliminary basis, to raise the issue of looking at the European option with the Attorney General.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving social and affordable housing is reflected in a number of recent announcements. In May I announced this year&rsquo;s allocations for the commencement of 5,500 new housing starts by local authorities to be further boosted to 6,000 <Col N="400"/>starts when new house starts under the regeneration programmes, principally in Ballymun, are taken into consideration. In addition, the main local authority construction programme will deliver the completion of 5,500 units this year. Output by the voluntary and co-operative sector is expected to add a further 1,800 house completions to supplement the main local authority housing construction programme.</P>
        <P>At the request of my Department, new multi-annual action plans have been prepared by local authorities for the provision of social and affordable housing for the period 2004 to 2008. These have been approved by my Department and are designed to assist local authorities in identifying priority needs in the next few years and providing a coherent, co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative sector. Financial envelopes have been secured for the next five years to underpin the multi-annual approach in the action plans.</P>
        <P>It is anticipated this year that total social housing provision, including new local authority housing, vacancies that arise in existing houses and output under the various measures, should meet the needs of about 13,000 households. This compares with 8,500 households in 1998. In addition, it is anticipated that the number of households in private accommodation will transfer to the new rental accommodation scheme. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to making housing more affordable is reflected in last week&rsquo;s announcement of the new affordable homes partnership. The partnership will drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>It is also intended that the partnership will take responsibility, as far as practicable, for the affordable housing initiative projects on State lands in the greater Dublin area. This will include the use of the land swap option, similar to that piloted on the Harcourt Terrace Lane site. The partnership will work initially via the existing planning development framework, but additional legislative powers will be available should they prove necessary.</P>
        <P>As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their housing programmes and voluntary and co-operative housing partnerships with the private sector, and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites. I believe that the development of the action plans and the increased capital investment this year in housing, along with the establishment of the new affordable homes partnership, reflects the Government&rsquo;s targeted response to social and affordable housing need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will we be able to use the time saved on other questions for this question?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="401"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>No. As this is the last week before the recess, the Chair will allow those questions. However, I do not want it to be taken as a precedent for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>I will therefore only use the time available to me. How many individuals and families are on local authority housing waiting lists? Does the Minister of State concede that the deficit of data in this area is very strange? Is it not true that the housing needs assessment is published once every three years? How can the Minister of State make policy in this area in these circumstances?</P>
        <P>How can the Minister of State justify his announcement last week on affordable housing when there is a lack of housing driving up local authority waiting lists every year? The Minister of State made a statement last week which sounded like it would solve all problems. Would it not be more desirable if the Minister of State sold land on the open market rather than give it away to builders and built houses in suitable areas rather than in the outskirts of cities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct. There is a major examination of housing lists every three years. The last compilation in 2002 showed that 48,000 families were on the lists. Families can be represented by just one person; 30% of the list consisted of single people and 32% consisted of one adult and one child. The 48,000 families on the list represented 109,000 people. People can calculate the figures on an ongoing basis but the major needs assessment is done every three years. The figures this year will be out in the autumn. One does not need monthly figures to set long-term plans. The three-year system represents a detailed needs assessment.</P>
        <P>Last week&rsquo;s announcement was a considerable response by the Government. It was a fabulous arrangement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

	<P>Up to 140 of them will be built this year and the remainder will be built early next year. That is the real beauty of it. We are not just providing more units, we are also providing them very quickly. We might have had to wait three or four years for the 30 apartments, but now we are getting 140 units this year and the remainder next year.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 26 together.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in this area and not enough attention has been paid to the issue of the voting register. We have had a number of priorities in recent years. Throughout the 1990s, we had the issue of the electoral code. The expenditure and donation regime was discussed and then we discussed the voting system. There has never really been a major debate on the voting register.</P>
        <P>The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for the appropriate local authority in accordance with electoral law and includes the carrying out of house-to-house inquiries, delivery of registration forms and running local awareness campaigns. It is the duty of local authorities to ensure the accuracy of the register. In carrying out this work, local authorities depend to a significant degree on the co-operation and engagement of the public.</P><Col N="403"/>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>There have been a number of reasons put forward for the state of register. Rapid population growth and development, increased personal mobility and other changes in modern society present difficulties for the preparation of the electoral register. I do not accept that these reasons explain fully the condition of the register. In overall terms, the number of people on the register in 2002 eligible to vote at D&aacute;il elections was 3.002 million. However, census data for 2002 indicate that there were 2.71 million voters over the age of 18 who were eligible to vote at these elections, representing a difference of 300,000. The main reasons for excess registration seem to include slowness to remove deceased persons from the register, changes of address without advising the local authority, as well as second houses.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>I share the concerns that have been expressed on the quality of the register and have already mandated my Department to examine any improvements that can and should be made. There will be a national awareness campaign later this year associated with preparation of the next register of electors by local authorities. We are monitoring developments in Northern Ireland and elsewhere regarding best practice on electoral registration. In terms of the voting process, we have introduced important new controls in recent times. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2002 contains more stringent requirements for entry to the supplement to the register. In the 2002 general election, polling staff were advised by the Department to require at least 25% of voters to produce an identity document. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 made unlawful possession or use of someone else&rsquo;s polling card a specific offence. Strong legislation must be mirrored locally by vigilance on the part of polling staff.</P>
        <P>There is a problem in this area which, as I have already mentioned to a number of Members, will require a cross-party approach to solve. All Members have practical experience which could be used to good effect. It would be very useful to hold full discussions on the matter at the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. If it is agreeable, I am willing to bring to the committee in the autumn the guidelines I have mentioned and to establish with representatives of parties on all sides of the House what is best practice elsewhere. We can consider suggestions such as the one Deputy Cuffe outlined in his question. The register requires an appropriate level of attention which it has failed to receive in the past. I want to see the matter resolved in the very near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. While I note with approval his reference to a cross-party approach to the matter, the fact is the Minister represents a Government which has wasted &euro;50 million on electronic voting machines which do not work or in which we do not have <Col N="404"/>confidence. The Government would have been far better off if it had decided to spend a much smaller sum of &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million per annum on a proper electoral register.</P>
        <P>I welcome the highlighting by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of the appalling disgrace that over 300,000 people are on the register who do not have the right to vote. It is not good enough that people have been multiply registered. While we can talk forever in committees, cannot the Minister talk to county managers and the Revenue collectors who often do the work in question in local authorities and ask them why the register is a mess, what resources have been invested and what action is required? It is an action the Minister could take quickly.</P>
        <P>Dedicated staff are required to visit voters. As the Minister rightly says, commuters are a significant problem as they leave home at 7 a.m. and do not return until 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. It is almost impossible to meet a commuter at his or her home, especially if he or she works in Dublin, as he or she is always travelling and is not home on weekends. Will the Minister engage proactively with county managers and those they have charged with the duty to compile the register to push the agenda forward? We will have them before the committee in the autumn. We would be better off to invest a great deal more money in a proper electoral register and encourage a great deal more people to vote. It does not matter if it takes two or three days to count their votes after an election. Let us encourage and enfranchise our citizens and ensure we get them out to vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with the Deputy on any point other than his attempt to introduce a different issue in his introductory remarks. The Deputy is correct to say local authorities have differing records. In some areas, there is good practice while in others it is very clear the practice is not good enough. I will engage with local authorities as soon as the guidelines have been produced.</P>
        <P>I have already indicated in my earlier response that I am very anxious to engage all sides in the House not only on the preparation of the register but also on voting and verification procedures. They are issues about which we are all concerned. There is a great deal of experience within the political system which can be used to assess how the system is failing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>How it is abused even.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and inform its improvement. I am willing to engage in the most open way possible with Members on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree there is a glaring anomaly in the current system of compilation of electoral rolls which delegates the function to local authorities without providing for the centralised cross-checking of the individuals <Col N="405"/>registered? Does the Minister accept his Department has overall responsibility for registration and in delegating responsibility to local authorities needs to keep a check on the figures? The Minister will be aware that the electoral office in Northern Ireland calls to each household twice a year at a cost of £6 million. Surely, the system could be replicated in the Republic for approximately &euro;15 million, a mere fraction of the cost of electronic voting.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the massive population movements of the last decade and that people tend to move more quickly than they did before. Does the Minister accept the current system is based largely on trust and that while the Government has expended tens of millions of euro on an electronic voting system to make very careful cross checks, it has failed to ensure voter registration is cross-checked at county level? Does he accept that a simple system of checks at a national level using personal public service numbers and a central office would make a great deal of sense? This would provide a more secure system which more accurately reflected those who have a right to be registered. It would also ensure that those who are deceased are no longer registered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Cuffe on many of his points, including his reference to the accuracy of electronic voting. We will leave that for another day, however.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We will leave it for years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to cross checking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While local authorities are currently required to conduct door-to-door inquiries, Deputy Cuffe was correct to say standards vary from authority to authority. I will put it no stronger than that. The process has always been decentralised and I am not disposed to centralising every activity. I would prefer, with reference to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s contribution, if local authorities did their job more efficiently and that we introduced a system to make sure that happened.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe referred to voter security and the use of personal public service numbers. While I am aware of the procedures operated in the North of Ireland, to introduce the cross-check Deputy Cuffe mentioned would, especially on voting day, require an information technology link between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the electoral database. A number of issues, including data protection, would arise with this approach. Nonetheless, I am open to considering any proposal which offers security in voting, has the potential to make the process more open and transparent and ensures the register is properly prepared. Whether we accept the number of surplus polling cards issued is 300,000 or 800,000 as hypothesised in the article referred to by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, it is simply not good enough to have a significant level of error <Col N="406"/>in the electoral register. I will impress on local authorities the need to carry out the job more effectively as the process of compiling the electoral register for next year continues.</P>
        <P>We are producing guidelines which I will make available in draft form to the joint committee this autumn. As we all share the same concern, I am prepared to sit down with any Member to discuss how to improve matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of people living in flats and apartments is one which particularly needs to be addressed. There is generally no difficulty with the older estates on which people have traditionally lived. Problems arise in areas in which people move about very quickly and it is to these the Minister should direct the attention of local authorities. Recently, I came across an apartment complex from which no one voted at the last election as people had moved on and the local register was out of date.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Minister to direct the attention of local authorities to the issue of the registration of people in rural areas alphabetically rather than by address. One does not know who is where. It is a matter which must be addressed for those of us who want to canvass every house by name but do not know everyone in a rural area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I take Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point. He is an excellent public representative but does not know absolutely everybody living on the highways and byways of Louth. If we had a postal code system, it would improve matters. It is also the case that local authorities are, to put it at its mildest, remiss in the matter of naming roads. Even in centres like Greystones, there are roads which have yet to be named. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s point on multiple occupancy addresses is valid. There is a propensity on the part of enumerators who check registers to miss many of the places in question. Additionally, there are increasing numbers of gated multiple-dwelling units to which it is impossible to gain access.</P>
        <P>I will try to address in the guidelines any reasonable suggestion a Member makes. There is a great deal of experience in the political system which can be brought to bear. We have all known for years that the electoral register has contained a significant degree of error and it is time the issue was addressed. I am anxious to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister accepts that reform of the electoral rolls is not rocket science. It is a comparatively simple undertaking, and using personal public service numbers does not raise significant data-sharing issues. The electoral rolls close a considerable time in advance of an election taking place. Surely a little cross-checking could be done at that point at national level and if there were duplicate PPS numbers one would simply write to the individuals advising them of this and giving them a chance to remove themselves from the register in one location? That could be done a long time in advance of the <Col N="407"/>election. It would allow us to deal with the 300,000, 800,000 or whatever number of people who are registered in two or more locations. It could be done comparatively simply. Would the Minister consider doing this relatively quickly and bring in the necessary regulations to ensure we can have a lot more confidence in who is on the register and that people are not registered in several locations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I see the attractions of the PPS approach as it offers a unique number which can be cross-checked. However, a system of cross-checking would have to be built into that to ensure efficiency when the registration system is in operation. Local authorities would have to be able to counter-check names against PPS numbers, and that is not as simple as it would appear. It is not rocket science if the linkage and the IT access are there but it raises a number of issues.</P>
        <P>As Deputy Cuffe said, one of the problems we have is that the register is closed at a specific date which is arbitrarily established. As a poll observer in South and Central America, I have seen polls operated by the Organisation of American States, and registration took place up to a very short time before the election. One of the big problems at the moment is that there is a cut-off point. I know the supplementary register has been introduced but it is not used as well as it could be.</P>
        <P>These are issues which we should all discuss because there is a problem in this regard and, irrespective of who was in government, we never addressed it. We have all known for years that problems exist with the register and now is the time to address it. I am willing to discuss it with Members of the House and to take on board reasonable suggestions. I do not think the situation on the PPS is quite as simple, as Deputy Cuffe suggests, although it has many attractions.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the total number of affordable houses that have been constructed, provided and allocated to date under Sustaining Progress and Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[22462/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004 is fully operational and all relevant residential planning applications are now subject to a Part V agreement. Apart from the provision of housing units to the local authority on or off-site, an agreement under Part V may provide for a range of other options. Notwithstanding the availability of these options, my Department&rsquo;s stated preference, which has been communicated to local authorities, is for the provision of housing units whether on-site or off-site.</P><Col N="408"/>
        <P>Under Part V agreements with developers, a total of 508 affordable housing units were acquired by local authorities up to the end of December 2004, 1,215 affordable units were in the course of acquisition and a further 2,260 were earmarked for acquisition on foot of Part V agreements with developers. In addition to the affordable housing units, nearly 300 social units have been acquired together with 12 land transfers to local authorities involving over 11 hectares, a further 156 sites have also been transferred and some &euro;11 million has been received in payments in lieu and under the withering levy. These figures demonstrate the effectiveness and further potential of Part V. I am confident that the Part V arrangement will contribute significantly to the provision of social and affordable housing in the future.</P>
        <P>Under the affordable housing initiative substantial progress continues to be made. Over 70 sites have been identified on State or local authority lands, which, including Part V, have a potential yield exceeding 10,000 affordable housing units, meeting the target proposed by the parties to the pay agreement. To date, the initiative has delivered nearly 500 units, including from Part V. Delivery will continue throughout 2005, with an estimated 1,350 units forecast for completion and projects with a potential of 2,200 units either under construction or commencing construction during 2005. Projects with an estimated potential of 3,400 units will commence construction during 2006.</P>
        <P>To promote the earliest possible delivery of units, a fast-tracking mechanism for delivery of units has been agreed and is being implemented. This followed a pilot land exchange arrangement for a 0.4 acre city centre site at Harcourt Terrace Lane which is to be exchanged for 193 additional affordable units to be made available on a phased basis over the next nine months. Some 140 of the units will be delivered in 2005 with the balance of 53 available early next year. In light of the positive outcome of the pilot land swap, a number of other sites will be developed using the same model.</P>
        <P>I assure the House that there is a strong commitment in Government to deliver on this initiative and I believe that the substantial progress made to date and our arrangements for accelerating delivery emphasise this commitment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State indicated that 500 dwellings have been provided under Sustaining Progress, including some from Part V. How many houses under Sustaining Progress, excluding those provided under Part V, have been provided to date?</P>
        <P>Do I understand the Minister of State correctly that from the Part V initiative that was originally announced in 1999, only 508 affordable dwellings have been provided to date, at a time when housing construction is running at almost 80,000 units per annum and when we were to expect 20% of <Col N="409"/>development to be provided by way of social and affordable housing initiatives?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State explain the inconsistency between the figure he has given me today and the figure which he provided for me on 18 May? Today he informed me that 1,215 dwellings were in the course of acquisition but on 18 May he informed me that 1, 910 dwellings were in the course of acquisition. He also informed me today that 2,260 dwellings were earmarked for acquisition but on 18 May he informed me that 2,885 were earmarked for acquisition. What has happened in the past six weeks that has caused 700 dwellings that were in the course of acquisition to disappear and 600 which were earmarked for acquisition to also disappear?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s question is about affordable units but the total dividend from Part V would include social as well as affordable units. The figure of 508 units relates to affordable housing. However, the total dividend from Part V is about 800 units.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

	<P>We are receiving a net consideration for this site of &euro;15.6 million, which is &euro;2.6 million more than its pre-sale valuation of &euro;13 million. This equates with &euro;39 million per acre and is at the top of the range of sale prices achieved in city centre locations. It is a very good deal.

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest> if, in view of the fact that the RPII estimates that between 10% and 15% of all lung cancer deaths in Ireland, which is the equivalent of 150 to 200 deaths per annum, are linked to radon gas exposure, he will consider the introduction of a radon testing scheme for homes and a grant to assist with the cost of remedial measures in cases in which houses are found to be above the accepted safe level of radon; if, in view of the recent survey from the RPII showing that new homes fitted with barriers to prevent the build-up of radon gas still have high levels of the gas, he intends to undertake a review of the building control regulations introduced in 1998, particularly with a view to ensuring that the protective barriers are properly installed; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[22463/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the years the Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and increasing public awareness of radon and public health. While the provision of Exchequer grant assistance for testing or remediation works is not envisaged, efforts will continue to be directed at improving information to householders to enable and encourage them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically. The institute has recently embarked on a series of nationwide public information seminars targeted at selected areas with high radon levels. These seminars have received widespread media coverage and generated a large number of inquiries.</P>
        <P>In October last I announced the publication of an updated technical guidance document under the 1997 building regulations containing enhanced radon prevention measures as recommended by the institute to be incorporated in the <Col N="412"/>construction of new houses and buildings with effect from 1 April this year. The enhanced measures which call for radon sump outlets to be clearly identified should help to further raise awareness among householders and the building industry.</P>
        <P>The institute has published the results of a recent survey undertaken by it of a number of houses in Kilkenny built before and after July 1998 when the updated 1997 regulations standards came into effect. This survey showed that, of the 33 houses built after July 1998, three had radon concentrations above the national reference level, including one which was very seriously affected and had a radon concentration of over seven times the reference level. However, the survey results also showed a reduction of some 33% in the average radon concentration in the houses built after July 1998 compared with the average concentration for houses surveyed by the institute under its national radon survey carried out in the period 1992 to 1997. I expect further improvements will emerge from the enhanced measures I have mentioned.</P>
        <P>The testing of domestic dwellings for radon is straightforward and inexpensive, amounting to approximately &euro;40 per house. I urge householders, particularly those in high risk areas, to check their houses for radon concentrations and carry out remediation work, if recommended.</P>
        <P>Both my Department and the RPII will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of the dangers of radon and every effort will continue to improve information to householders to enable them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister that we are talking about 200 entirely avoidable deaths per annum. He has stated enhanced measures for excluding radon gas from houses were introduced recently. He has also referred to the building and other regulations made on foot of these which were developed by his Department under the guidance of his constituency colleague, Deputy McManus, when she was Minister of State at the Department. Does he agree that the regulations are not working because of one simple failure, that is, the expectation the building industry should self-regulate? If I were to pick one industry in the world that should not be asked to self-regulate, it would be the building industry. Strict regulation should be imposed on it rather than self-regulation.</P>
        <P>That the houses supposed to have exclusion systems fitted since 1997 are now found to have dangerous levels of radon gas indicates clearly that the measures required to be taken at construction stage are not being implemented correctly. I am sure the Minister will agree. There is no inspection at any stage except at the end of the process, at which time an architect signs a piece of paper. This architect is hired by the builder during the planning process and subsequently paid <Col N="413"/>by him or her to state the development is built in accordance with the building regulations, including radon gas regulations. Does the Minster have any view on enforcing the regulations rather than allowing self-regulation? Does he agree that there should be a requirement on those selling pre-1997 houses to have a radon test carried out on the dwellings before they are sold?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s gloomy view of the effect of the 1997 regulations. In so far as we do have a study &mdash; the study conducted by the RPII on houses in Kilkenny after the regulations came into effect &mdash; it suggests there has been a significant improvement. I accept it also suggests there is room for further improvement. I have sought to make the issue much more clear in the new regulations which I have outlined. For example, radon sumps should be marked clearly and readily identifiable.</P>
        <P>On the general issue, the regulations I have introduced are being enforced. The Deputy&rsquo;s points on inspection and the sale of houses require further consideration. He made a point on the sale of older or other houses. As he will know, the RPII has made a submission to the Law Reform Commission advocating the inclusion of radon-reducing measures in further legislation on house conveyancing. I must give further consideration to this suggestion.</P>
        <P>The regulations that have been introduced further strengthen the procedures. There is an overwhelming onus on property owners to ensure radon levels in their homes are properly monitored. It is not expensive to carry out a radon test. Paying &euro;40 is certainly not difficult for most households. In a number of areas local authorities have provided monitoring devices, particularly for rented accommodation. I encourage householders to take up from the RPII what is available in terms of monitoring. I will give further consideration to the matter of conveyancing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Money is the usual problem. We have asked the Minister repeatedly to introduce grants to assist with the cost of remediation where required. I am not referring to testing for radon as this involves a relatively small sum of money. Last year the Department sent back &euro;154 million which it did not spend to the Department of Finance. It sent back another &euro;17 million pertaining to disabled persons&rsquo; grants because it did not spend it. Therefore, there is no question of the Department not having the money.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Some 200 people are dying per year because of the radon problem. Their medical treatment is costing the State &euro;200 million per year. The average cost of treating a lung cancer patient, from the time he or she is diagnosed with cancer to the time he or she dies, is &euro;1 million per year, given that such patients usually die of cancer. Radon poisoning is costing the State a fortune. I ask the Minister to remedy the problem with a relatively small sum of money. The problem is, as I am sure the Mini<Col N="414"/>ster will agree, that there are or should be two Departments involved &mdash; the Departments of Health and Children and Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

	<P>Grant schemes have been introduced elsewhere and have not been terribly successful.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 34, 112 and 114 together.</P>
        <P>I recently announced that the Government has approved my proposals to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to help fast-track major infrastructure projects. The Government&rsquo;s objective in advancing these proposals is to contribute to the delivery of a highly effective infra<Col N="415"/>structure that the public rightfully demands while, at the same time, respecting the environment and the right of people to object to developments. It is important to provide greater certainty on the timeframe for delivering decisions while at the same time ensuring robust analysis of proposals.</P>
        <P>The proposed new legislation will establish a new strategic infrastructure division as part of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The new division will handle the planning decisions for major roads and motorways and other large-scale projects proposed by local authorities that the board currently oversees. The division&rsquo;s role will also extend to decisions on other strategic infrastructure, for example, railways and major electricity transmission lines.</P>
        <P>In addition, the new legislation will provide that major transport, environmental and energy infrastructure projects that are of strategic importance and that at present require a planning application accompanied by an environmental impact statement to be submitted to the local authority will be referred directly to the new division of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>It is also my intention that the board will take a more proactive role in the pre-planning process for such projects, especially to ensure that developers deal with all relevant matters in their planning applications and environmental impact statements. This will help to ensure that the key planning issues and appropriate environmental mitigation measures are addressed by developers at an early stage in the process, which should help to avoid unexpected delays at a later stage and aid people who wish to review the process. The public will also have substantial rights to comment on infrastructure proposals before the board, as is the case for major local authority infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I am happy that the new proposals build on the proven expertise of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in handling planning appeals and, since 2001, approvals of major local authority infrastructure. Obviously I am concerned to ensure that the board is adequately resourced and has appropriate organisational structures to handle these new responsibilities as well as maintaining its current excellent performance in respect of planning appeals. My Department is in discussions with the board and the Department of Finance to ensure this outcome.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that as well as changes to the planning system, we need to tackle delays in the courts. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will therefore examine ways, in consultation with the courts, to ensure that cases get heard earlier and that court decisions are made quickly. In addition to these changes, I am proposing some specific changes to judicial review of planning decisions in the draft Bill.</P>
        <P>Drafting of the new legislation, which is complex and will take some months, has begun. The new division will be brought into operation as <Col N="416"/>soon as possible after the legislation has been enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The final section of the M50 will at last open on Thursday. This has been 20 years coming, the first six or seven of which were taken up by the old Dublin County Council preparing an initial design. The next five years were taken up by the EIS process which was ordered by the Minister&rsquo;s Department to examine and change the different routes. It took three years from the time the Minister signed off on the motorway scheme until construction started. All told, I can only count 18 months where the scheme was on public display or when there were planning delays, including cases taken with regard to the Carrickmines issue.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this legislation is to fast-track infrastructural development but, given the M50 experience, to address the planning aspect is to address the shortest element of delay. The greatest delays appear to occur where elements which have nothing to do with public consultation are concerned, such as design, consultants and contract document preparation.</P>
        <P>If major projects are to be referred directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is to be the planning authority of first instance, will there be an appeal process from that or will we be left in a situation where the courts are the only recourse for people who wish to submit an appeal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>People will be able to make submissions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Deputy Gilmore must be the only person in the country who would dispute that infrastructure developments have been delayed in this country for an inordinate amount of time. He gave a highly questionable analysis of the M50. However, I draw his attention a little further down the road to the extraordinary delays that were encountered in the Glen of the Downs on the N11 and the Arklow sewerage scheme which has been locked in legal and planning battles for 12 and a half years. Deputy Gilmore is probably the only Member of the Oireachtas that holds the view he has canvassed here.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la did some analysis in this area which reflected that the time taken in High Court proceedings on which judgment was given in 2003 and 2004 was 92 weeks. It took almost two years from the lodging of an appeal to final court decision. It is a fallacy to suggest that we have not had undue delays in delivering planning and infrastructure, and I am surprised that the Deputy would do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not addressing the problem. He is only addressing part of it &mdash; the populist bit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am addressing the planning problem and not only the populist aspect. The citizens and taxpayers of this country have a right to <Col N="417"/>understand and expect that planning will be handled in a timely way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The consultants will not take five years, but one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with the Deputy. Undue bureaucratic delay must also be dealt with. However, it is simply nonsense for the Deputy to suggest there has not been undue delay and an abuse of the planning system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The greatest delays with regard to the M50 were outside the planning process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a rank abuse of the system in the cases of the N11, the Arklow sewerage scheme and others. I have outlined the points raised by An Bord Plean&aacute;la statistics. Some 32 of the board&rsquo;s decisions last year were challenged in the courts, which is an increase of eight since the previous year. Therefore there must obviously be an integrated approach and we must build on what has been a record in An Bord Plean&aacute;la. We must also deal with the manner in which the courts system has been abused to introduce delays which have cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds and added huge amounts of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to Question No. 34, what is the status of the transformation of An Bord Plean&aacute;la? How much of the work has been done? How far advanced is the appointments process? Is the funding yet in place? Can the Minister estimate how quickly a major infrastructure project will go through the planning process under the new system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Until such time as the legislation is in place, it would neither be prudent nor normal to make the funding available up front. However, I and my Department are engaging with An Bord Plean&aacute;la to discover what it needs and with the Department of Finance to ensure the necessary resources are in place.</P>
        <P>Deputy McCormack should consider the alternative of a second board, an issue which was canvassed at one point. A limited number of people with planning expertise at a very senior level are available in this country and we are conserving and focusing them within An Bord Plean&aacute;la. It is better to review, revise and update an existing system which works quite well at that level.</P>
        <P>The Deputy also asked how long the process will take. It will be a difficult piece of drafting, and there will then be a lengthy debate on the issue when it comes before the House. It would be wrong of me to speculate on how long the process will take. I am anxious to ensure the process is as limited as possible. With regard to the personnel numbers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the process be complete before the next election?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="418"/>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so. We have until 2007 to complete it and I certainly hope we can do so. Deputies McCormack and O&rsquo;Dowd have planning and infrastructural issues in their constituencies, which I know are of concern to them. Given their concerns, I anticipate help from them in getting the legislation through when it is presented to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>To take up the last point made by the Minister, is it not the case that his predecessor, Deputy Cullen, met Indaver Ireland at the end of the planning process regarding an incinerator for Carranstown? The company made submissions to the then Minister and he agreed to change the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Is that not a fact? At the same time, the process relating to the waste licensing system had not been completed through the Environmental Protection Agency. Is it also not a fact that Greenstar, another company with interests in waste licensing in this country, met officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in Brussels &mdash; I do not know why they met in Brussels &mdash; to make a submission to them on the decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la?</P>
        <P>If the Minister is putting An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the heart of his plans for a fast-track decision making process, which I welcome, it is utterly wrong that Ministers would try to change or sidestep decisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by changing regulations. The Minister brought in regulations several weeks ago relating to regional boundaries for the transport of waste. Those regulations have put Indaver Ireland back in position and allowed it to circumvent the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which was a democratic one.</P>
        <P>If one disagrees with a decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, one has a right to appeal it to the High Court, which was the process to date. From now on, however, the Minister proposes to establish a process for specific projects whereby an incinerator developer, for example, can lobby the Minister to introduce new regulations to circumvent a decision that is not to his or her liking. This can occur, notwithstanding the fact that thousands of people may have objected to the incinerator, as is the case in my constituency, in County Cork and other parts of the country. This is simply not good enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister raised objections.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McCormack is correct, the Minister objected to incinerators in the past. Where does he stand on the issue now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The allegations from Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd are outstanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not allegations, they are statements of fact, and I have the documents to prove it.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="419"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair play to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd if that is the case. Let us nail the Minister on these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the two major causes of delays are political indecision and appeals by property owners? Is he putting any measure in place to deal with these two issues? He must accept that the Luas was delayed for several years by Deputy Harney&rsquo;s dithering over whether it should be put underground or over ground. Even now, the two lines still do not join up in the city centre. The M50 was delayed for years because appeals by property owners were going through the courts. Is the Minister doing anything about either issue? After three years in government we still do not have a decision on the proposed metro.</P>
        <P>On the issue of judicial review and judicial proceedings, there is a marked silence as to what the Minister&rsquo;s colleague is doing in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Has Deputy McDowell given the Minister anything in writing about his proposals to deal with the legal obstacles to the process? The two major causes of delays on projects are political indecision and legal challenges, and I am not convinced that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has done anything to address either of those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if the Deputy heard me correctly, but I made a major point about improving the situation in terms of legal challenges. I reject the idea that a Minister should retrospectively interfere with any decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

	<P>Very few people in the country will forget the description, in May 2002, of the campus Ireland project by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as being &ldquo;Ceaucescu-like&rdquo;, but recent revelations suggest that this analogy might not be as far-fetched as people imagined. After all, the infamous Romanian tyrant left behind him a battery of extravagant, egotistical, sub-standard, unfinished monuments and buildings, the price for which his people will continue to pay for many years to come. The debacle of the National Aquatic Centre truly is an apt metaphor for the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government &mdash; massive costs to the public, a so-called state-of-the-art attraction that is all splash, with fake waves, the roof blown off and leaking like a sieve.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that, as the sole promoter and shareholder of this project, he is personally responsible for the huge failures that have been exposed. Does the Taoiseach stand over his statement at the opening of the centre on 10 March 2003 that &ldquo;a visionary concept has been brought to magnificent fruition&rdquo;? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the facility is leaking water at the rate of 5 million litres per month and that a consultant&rsquo;s report has found that the original roof structure was substandard, suggesting that either corners were cut or plans were washed away at the construction stage? Were these facts known to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, who claimed two weeks ago that the &euro;62 million capital expenditure on the project &ldquo;represents money very well spent&rdquo; or can we take it that this farce is the benchmark, or rather the tide mark, of Government spending and standards?</P>

	<P>Everyone should allow the courts to deal with the issue and not be fooled by red herrings, because that is what yesterday&rsquo;s furore in the media is about. I am very sad to see the Opposition aligning itself with the company that CSID has taken to court and acting as its mouthpiece in the House today. Opposition Deputies appear to have no compunction about making public statements on matters before the courts. I agree with CSID that court proceedings should not be prejudiced and will not attempt to prejudge the outcome of the court&rsquo;s deliberations. Once the court proceedings have been completed, CSID will no longer be constrained from putting the facts before the public and answering any questions Deputies, the media or anyone else may have about the various matters before the court.</P>

	<P>I am happy to outline the factual position for the House. CSID has a legal action in the commercial court against Dublin Waterworld, the operator of the aquatic centre, for breaches of the lease agreement. In the commercial court on 3 June Mr. Justice Peter Kelly made an order regarding the following matters which were the subject of a statement of claim lodged by CSID against Dublin Waterworld.</P>

The dispute regarding repair and maintenance and as to whether Dublin Waterworld has properly maintained the national aquatic centre has been referred to an architect for expert determination. This process is under way as per the court ruling.</P>
      <P>On the question of the lease, the remaining issues against Dublin Waterworld for failure to pay rent, the failure to provide audited accounts, thus preventing the profit share to be circulated; the failure to pay insurance on the building; and the failure to establish a sinking fund, are still subject to court proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Does the Taoiseach stand over the remarks he made about the shelf company on 26 March 2002, that despite being a shelf company, it was a company not only of substance but of international standing? It was criticised in the High Court yesterday when Mr. Justice Kelly queried the reason a company worth &euro;127 should be given a 30 year lease on an asset worth &euro;62 million. Does the Taoiseach now stand over that statement? Has the company lived up to his expectations? Will he stand over the arrangements whereby the Government entered into an agreement with the company which was sharply criticised in the High Court?</P>
      <P>I was in the Mansion House last night to welcome the new Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Catherine Byrne. In the middle of all the pomp and power, I noticed the coat of arms of the Ahern family whose motto reads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Since Deputy Kenny has asked for my opinion, the Government is not happy with the performance of the company. While it <Col N="425"/>has done a very good job in Killarney in the Kerry operation, it has not done a good job in this case. That is the reason CSID has brought the company to court. I support the action being taken. Obviously, I do not stand over the remarks made at the time.</P>
      <P>I have already answered the question of what happened on 1 January. People have been critical of the damage caused by the freak storm. It is unfortunate it damaged a large number of buildings in the area, uprooted 200 year old trees and hit the centre. A report on the damage was commissioned by the OPW following a request from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in consultation with CSID. Its findings were taken into account in agreeing the repair programme with the contractor. Legal, contractual and financial issues are being considered in the light of the report.</P>
      <P>Our primary concern at all times must be to protect the taxpayer&rsquo;s investment and that is what we are doing. In spite of all the exaggerations in the newspapers about leaks and cracks, the national aquatic centre is fully operational&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was in it ten days ago for a national swimming competition in which children and teenagers from all over the country participated. Since the issues are being dealt with in the courts, CSID is constrained from dealing with them in the media while it is fighting in the courts. I want to see the company win the case and compel Dublin Waterworld to pay. I hope the necessary legal process will resolve the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the state of the aquatic centre is a metaphor for the state of the Government? He has just admitted that the centre and the Government are his own creations; that both are defective and incapable of performing the job they were set up to do. Their foundations are cracked and both are leaking like a sieve. They are swallowing up and wasting taxpayer&rsquo;s money and both are involved in a cover-up and PR bluster.</P>
      <P>I refer to one of the cover-ups, the circumstances where as a result of the story in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday we now know that what has been asserted from these benches all this time is true, that both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day and the Attorney General of the day had full knowledge from the report submitted by then Deputy Commissioner Conroy in August 2000 of what was happening in County Donegal and the circumstances surrounding the framing of the McBrearty family and so on. Despite this, they refused to investigate. They came into this House and voted down a motion tabled by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and the Green Party to have the matter inquired into. <Col N="426"/>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, anxious as ever to give precedence to the necessity to clear himself and make a display of the correctness of his own advice, has dropped the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, into the most serious situation any Minister has experienced in this shambles of a Government.</P>
      <P>He has created a circumstance where the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, is on the run. He will not even appear on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; when invited. He will not come in here in case he is asked a question about it. I want to ask the Taoiseach a question because he came in here and misled the House as well. He said they only had partial knowledge and not then until November 2001. We know they had the Conroy report in August 2000. Was the Conroy report in any way inadequate and, if the answer is no, why did the Taoiseach promote him to Commissioner? If the answer is yes, why did the Taoiseach fail to investigate the serious matters with which he dealt? That report is a very comprehensive summary of what is in the Carty report. The fact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is shaking his head and that witness statements were not appended is neither here nor there. If I were Minister for Justice and I or any Minister for Justice got the entire barrow full of the Carty report, he or she would be annoyed. Assistant Commissioner Conroy summarised the gravamen of the allegations in a 37-page legible, intelligible report to these two Ministers and now they are covering up why they failed to investigate one of the most serious public interest issues in this jurisdiction.</P>

	<P>Deputy Rabbitte made two points. As we approach the school summer holidays thousands of children throughout the country are using the National Aquatic Centre every day. Therefore, the Deputy is badly informed on this issue and totally wrong.</P>
      <P>In February 1999, Assistant Commissioner Carty was appointed by the Garda Commissioner to investigate allegations that garda&iacute; in Donegal had engaged in criminal and unethical behaviour. In July 2000, Assistant Commissioner Carty submitted his report &mdash; that was the investigation file &mdash; to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In August 2000, Assistant Commissioner Conroy forwarded a 37-page summary of Carty report to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This was not the Carty report.</P>

	<P>The Deputies do not understand this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte wanted to ignore a judge in the last case and now he wants <Col N="427"/>to ignore the Director of Public Prosecutions. I ask him to please listen. At that stage the Director of Public Prosecutions was considering the Carty report and its recommendations and prosecutions. A number of civil actions related to Donegal were well under way and a number of complaints were then with the Garda Complaints Board. In light of the growing controversy, in June 2001, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, sought a preliminary opinion from the Attorney General about the options open to him to have the matter inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A year later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Attorney General replied in June 2001. He required sight of the full Carty report. The Attorney General, while agreeing that a public inquiry was the most attractive option, advised that since tribunals had to be conducted in public it would seriously prejudice the pending prosecutions. He also advised that a tribunal could be established if the truth did not emerge in the pending court cases.</P>
      <P>In November 2001, having consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions on foot of the Attorney General&rsquo;s request to see the Garda file, the Garda Commissioner gave an edited version of the Carty report to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This consisted of those parts of the Carty report considered to be relevant to the defence of the civil actions related to Donegal. This edited version was a very bulky document and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions remarked that it would be difficult for persons reading themselves into the case to make sense of the issues without sight of these papers. Therefore, it was not possible to do it and the Director of Public Prosecutions had declared that.</P>
      <P>In November 2001, Mr. Shane Murphy was appointed to review all the papers and advise how best to proceed. The full Carty report was given to the Department in the second half of January 2002. Mr. Murphy submitted his report at the end of that month also.</P>
      <P>In February 2002, the Government approved, in principle, the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry and the drafting of a Bill to amend the tribunals of inquiry Act to facilitate the holding of an inquiry allowing a tribunal to hold part of its hearing in private, if necessary, to avoid prejudicing a criminal prosecution. At all times the Minister and the Attorney General were anxious to have the matter fully inquired into. The issue in question was &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte knows this because I said this last week &mdash; one of prejudicing pending proceedings and that difficulty was overcome only by amending the law, and that is what happened. Those are the full facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the history of this case now no thanks to the Taoiseach or the Ministers, Deputies McDowell and O&rsquo;Donoghue. They all <Col N="428"/>gave us conflicting, partial, half answers. It is no thanks to the Minister, Deputy McDowell, that whoever leaked it to whomsoever leaked it, in turn, to <i>The Irish Times</i> that we now know the sequence of events. It now seems the Taoiseach as well as the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will dump on the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. The Taoiseach keeps saying he had only a partial report and so on. The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, said &ldquo;The investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the DPP&rdquo; in answer to a question from Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge this is disquieting and I enjoyed the way the Minister, Deputy McDowell, declared the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, innocent judicially. I enjoyed his performance last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that is the judicial decree in the matter. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has declared the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, to be blameless and innocent, and that this should be good enough for him and that he should skulk off to south Kerry and not appear on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; or anywhere else to answer questions. The Minister has dropped him in it, and he knows that. The Taoiseach has come in here and said that when the Assistant Commissioner of the day, Noel Conroy, intelligibly put the evidence together from the Carty report in a legible form and submitted it to the Ministers, that this was not the Carty report. I refer to an answer from one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessors, Mr. Haughey, when he denied that there was any such meeting. The Taoiseach is now denying there was any such report. We are not talking about the investigation file of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, nor about the depth of documents that must be furnished to the Director of Public Prosecutions before a prosecution is mounted; we are talking about the substance, the gravamen, of the allegations made where two citizens were framed for a murder that was never committed. Neither the Taoiseach nor anyone else could answer the question as to why that was redesignated from a murder to a hit and run two years earlier than we were told about it and the Taoiseach allowed a debate to happen in this House to cause a tribunal to be set up and we did not even know Mr. McBrearty and his first cousin did not know that they were no longer under suspicion for murder because it had been redesignated a hit and run two years ago.

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2001, which was a long time after that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It could have been done two years earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;having consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions on foot of the Attorney General&rsquo;s request to see the Garda file, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions noted that it would be difficult for persons reading themselves into the case to make sense of the issues without sight of these papers. That was a long time after that particular period. The full Carty report was not available until 2002. The Minister had raised the issue the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It could have been done two years earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He had written asking for advice and looking for the options and that issue was dealt with. Six months after this was done, the Director of Public Prosecutions was still raising the issue of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a limited inquiry. Deputies McDowell and O&rsquo;Donoghue could not be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Since Deputy Rabbitte is intimating that there were divisions between the Minister, me and the Attorney General when everyone knows that was not the case, I will again repeat that it was this Government and not the Opposition which identified the solution to the impasse which existed during this period, namely, the enactment of legislation to enable a tribunal to hold part of its proceedings in private to avoid possible prejudice, which was a difficulty. The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>He could not be investigated by the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;brought forward that amending legislation to facilitate this. That is why we passed in this House the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)(Amendment) Act and that is why we have the Morris tribunal today. Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="432"/>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not told anything like the full story in so far as investigations indicate. Does he believe in the basic wisdom that justice delayed is justice denied? On that basis will he explain to the House whether he finds it satisfactory that when the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, received the report of the Carty investigation, over nine months elapsed before the advice of the Attorney General was sought?</P>
      <P>On the basis of the questions which arise from that, would the Taoiseach not like to see a Private Notice Question on which Deputy Cuffe has been working on behalf of the Green Party in which Deputies O&rsquo;Donoghue and McDowell could answer for their lack of actions in the course of this saga? Not only was there a nine-month delay, when the advice was sought, the full file was not made available to the Attorney General, as we now know. Was that not unacceptable to the Taoiseach?</P>
      <P>Is he not, as Taoiseach, duty bound to hold to account Ministers who displayed such ineptitude and prevarication on a matter which has not only cost the State a great deal of money, but has also damaged the reputation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and generated enormous trauma and pain, particularly for the McBrearty family and others? Will he not take responsibility as Head of Government and initiate action about what we now know to have been ineptitude and prevarication?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is again raising the issue of the delay. As I have already stated, the reason for the nine-month delay was that the DPP was considering the file over that period. Even in November 2001, a long time after that period, the Office of the DPP&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;remarked that it would be difficult for persons reading themselves into the case to make sense of the issues without sight of the papers. That was the position. The Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform were all concerned, but there were cases pending and this could not simply be ignored. That was the issue.</P>
      <P>In the light of the controversy that was growing, in the summer of 2001 the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, sought the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice about the options that were open to him. He got a quick reply which said the Attorney General could not make a judgment on that until he saw the full Carty report. That was in June. In November the DPP was saying the same thing.</P>
      <P>To try to paint the picture now that the Attorney General and the DPP had the full Carty report, as some Members maintain, when the fact is that they did not and two officers of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>He did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies are misleading the House again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s question. The Taoiseach, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a pity, just to try to confuse issues, that Members of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no confusion in my mind about this. The Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Commissioner and the assistant Garda commissioner, Mr. Carty, knew there were cases pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>What about screening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Director of Public Prosecutions was dealing with those cases. The Attorney General was not prepared to give the options and the DPP was not prepared to go to finality until they saw the full report. That is what happened and no amount of bluster will change that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was too late to vote down a tribunal of inquiry motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Statutory officers of the State have stated they were not proceeding until they got the full report. Neither did they&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It was covering up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and when they did, this Government acted. Those are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, told the House on 23 May 2001: &ldquo;The investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the DPP.&rdquo; The Minister implied that he had received the Carty report, not just Deputy Commissioner Conroy&rsquo;s synopsis of it, before passing it on. Even if it was only a synopsis, the Taoiseach knows this is damning. To hide behind it as if it were some type of innocent document that does not tell the full story is in itself a perversion of the truth. The Taoiseach has not answered why the full file of the investigation was not passed over to the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I would like to tease this out. The Taoiseach suggests that because the DPP is addressing a matter, somehow there is a wall of silence between Cabinet Ministers and the Attorney <Col N="434"/>General. Is it not the case that the Attorney General is employed, very handsomely, to give political advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Legal advice of a political nature, I would argue, in terms of the Government. Not to ask for that is, in itself, an irresponsible lack of action. Does the Taoiseach not accept that on the back of that delay by the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, the Attorney General was involved in prosecuting criminal cases in which we now know the State to have been in the wrong? Is the Taoiseach not duty bound as Head of Government to hold to account the people who brought about that farcical situation and, in turn, wasted an enormous amount of money, damaged the reputation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and sentenced the McBrearty family to years of trauma, which was completely unjust and of which they were innocent? As Taoiseach he is required to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I should not have to, but I will, remind Deputy Sargent that the Attorney General does not prosecute criminal cases. Since 1975 it is the Director of Public Prosecutions. That change was made 30 years ago, so the basis of his argument is incorrect.</P>
      <P>This is the second time in this debate today that Members have stated what the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, did at the time. They know that, on the record, just prior to the section they quote from, he made it absolutely clear that he had not seen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just given the references but I will give them again. In light of the growing controversy in June 2001, the then Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, sought a preliminary opinion, in writing, from the Attorney General about the options open to him to have the matter inquired into. The Attorney General replied in June 2001. The reply cited the full Carty report. That is one reference.</P>
      <P>In November 2001&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had approximately 20 interruptions. I am just giving facts and the Deputy is trying to twist them.</P>

	<P>They are not facts.</P>

	<P>I ask Deputy Howlin to remain silent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In November 2001, the edited version was a bulky document but the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions remarked that it would be difficult for persons reading themselves into the case to make sense of the issues without sight of the full report and the papers. That was the second reference. What I have outlined is, therefore, the factual position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is bluster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Lastly, in February 2002, when the Government approved in principle the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill 2002, it did so when it received the full Carty report. Those are the facts and I cannot change <Col N="436"/>them. I cannot give Deputy Sargent anything other than the facts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of anyone apologising when the law officers of the State made clear determinations at the time, all of which are on the record. The fact that Opposition Deputies are trying to paint a delay&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a delay.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Title>Requests to move Adjournment of D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an issue of national importance, namely, that the Health Service Executive has decided, after inspection, not to recommend the transfer of Leas Cross residents to certain other nursing homes in the Dublin area, the breaches of regulations found at the further homes in question, the names of the homes in question, whether they are registered <Col N="437"/>homes under the Health Acts and if they continue to be so registered, if any public patients are resident in the homes and if they will now be moved to other homes, if any subvented patients are resident in the homes, if they will be moved or advised to move and, if not, why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to make a statement on biofuels production in view of the proposal for changes in the sugar regime. In view of the importance of this issue, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern, namely, the increasing vulnerability of workers, in particular migrant workers, who are affected by sudden closures in the construction industry, often on public contracts, without notice, breaches of statutory regulations and general absence of protection and the need for a hardship fund to address their immediate needs and such statutory changes as will meet their basic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the fact that a large construction company, Glenman Corporation, which has Government contracts to build council houses in Ballymun, Fortunestown B and other places, has failed to meet its payment obligations to more than a dozen other companies which have subcontracted work, including one company, KBD civil engineering, which is owed &euro;374,000, and another company owed &euro;254,000, and this is resulting in a significant threat of job losses and companies going to the wall &mdash; and the associated tensions created by such non-payment of Bills &mdash; and the need for the Government to make transparent, accountable and fair its procurement procedures in light of such evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of national importance, namely, the ongoing difficulties between CSID and Dublin Waterworld regarding the National Aquatic Centre and the need for the Taoiseach or the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement clarifying the various difficulties which have arisen in respect of the building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not in order to go beyond the statement submitted to my office. Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 13, Social Welfare Consolidation Bill 2005 &mdash; First Stage; No. 14, motion re proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of a report by the Minister for Defence pursuant to section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, back from committee; No. 27, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Report and Final Stages (resumed); No. 1, Disability Bill 2004 &mdash; amendments from the Seanad; and No. 28, Veterinary Practice Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Order for Report, Report and Final Stages.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. and business shall be interrupted not later than 10 p.m.; Nos. 13 and 14 shall be decided without debate; the proceedings on the resumed Report and Final Stages of No. 27 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 60 minutes by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government; and the proceedings on No. 1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 9 p.m. and any amendments from the Seanad not disposed of shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Seanad amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Private Members&rsquo; Business shall be No. 56, motion re G8 summit and overseas development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four proposals to be put to the House. Is the proposal for the late sitting agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to record my point in this manner but there is no other parliamentary procedure for so doing. What happened last week was as big a shambles as I have ever seen in the House. Deputies were required to vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise at this stage. The question is whether the Deputy opposes the late sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is directly connected. We had to come into the House to vote on something and we did not even know, with the number of items of different coloured paper that had been circulated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Ceann Comhairle wants me to explain the reason I am opposed to the proposal, I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="439"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must have some sort of order on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>On Friday night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, blamed the Ceann Comhairle and the staff of the House because the amendments were not disseminated. Anybody who knows anything about the Bills Office, knows that its staff are the most industrious in the House. I am sure I need not labour the point or say how distressed I was that the Minister should reflect on the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s efficiency</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should resume his seat as he is out of order. As he is opposed to the late sitting, I will put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I just wanted to place on record the disquiet caused to me over the weekend by the Minister&rsquo;s decision to reflect on the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s deficiency, which was unfair in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
      <P>Question, &ldquo;That the late sitting be agreed to,&rdquo; put and declared carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13 and 14 without debate agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>On No. 14, when does the Government expect to make an announcement about Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the battle groups referred to under the Department of Defence proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated previously, the matter is under examination but it will take considerable time. It will not arise for a number of months. We have not opted in or out at this stage, we must consider how we can participate if we are to go down that road. Many countries have already declared that they are looking at the major infrastructural issues and we must assess if we can usefully do it. It will be some time before we complete our assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be this year or next year? I heard on a radio programme last week that the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, got an award for straight talking. How long will this assessment take? Will the Minister for Defence indicate whether we are in or out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach explain why the First Stage of a Bill is being introduced without debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Deputy Sargent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I not get an answer?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="440"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking questions on the same proposal together, as is the standard practice, and we will then hear from the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle will be aware that it is also standard practice to oppose the taking or lumping together of items as if they are of no consequence. He should take into account that the Green Party does not regard it as satisfactory to take No. 14, which has just come back from committee. This item is a significant defence motion which must be considered and our giving it the nod takes for granted the Government&rsquo;s thinking on the matter, something it has not made clear. I ask that the Minister for Defence make a clear statement in the House and that we debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister hopes to be in a position to do that at the end of the summer, so it will happen when the House returns in the autumn.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Stagg, the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill passed First Stage and was sent to committee, as has happened since the first consolidation Bill in 1980. The motion will just move it into committee in order that the matter can be dealt with during July and September, when committees will continue to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13 and 14 agreed? Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 27, conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005, agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party is opposed, on two grounds, to a guillotine being imposed on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, which will revise D&aacute;il constituencies. As a matter of principle, the Government should not use its majority, in the form of a guillotine, to enact legislation on the revision of constituencies because the latter are at the heart of our electoral and democratic system.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we cannot adopt the proposal before the House. On Report Stage on 16 June, the House agreed to recommit section 3 in order to address an issue I raised, namely, the likelihood that it will emerge from the census in 2006 that, on foot of an increase and change in the location of population, significant revision of D&aacute;il boundaries will be required. If the election is held after the publication of the census figures in 2006, it may give rise to legal proceedings and constitutional questions in respect of the Bill. The recommitted Committee Stage of section 3 is still in progress. The House adjourned without concluding the Committee Stage debate on section 3 and it is not possible to make an order for the resumed Report and Final Stage of the Bill until the Committee Stage debate is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="441"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, it has been agreed to recommit amendment No. 1 for discussion in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first question, we have tried during this session not to guillotine Bills. The guillotine has been applied in very few instances in recent months. There has been an <Col N="442"/>extensive debate on this matter and the legislation emanates from an independent body. The Government has given adequate time to something we have all accepted as a <i>fait accompli</i> from the outset.</P>

	<P>The Green Party once again opposes the guillotining of the Disability Bill. It asks the Ceann Comhairle and the Government to have regard to the significant meeting that <Col N="444"/>took place last night in Limerick and the ongoing strength of feeling around the country, not least because the Minister has indicated that he believes in the virtues of inequality. It is absolutely essential that we go back to the drawing board in respect of the Bill and put the requisite rights-based legislation in place. To proceed on this basis is to do a disservice to this House and people with disabilities.</P>

	<P>I also record Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opposition to the proposal that we proceed with the 33 amendments which are broadly technical in nature and do absolutely nothing to address the fundamental flaws in the Disability Bill identified by the disability legislation consultation group, a body established by the Government. Hence, it is absolutely bizarre that the House is proceeding with the legislation which has proceeded through both Houses and is now back in the D&aacute;il. As I stated, there are 33 amendments, none of which addresses any of the substantive inadequacies of the Bill in meeting the needs of people with disabilities. Sinn F&eacute;in would have been happy to address the Bill on its return from the Seanad if the amendments reflected the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities but sadly that is not the case. Accordingly, we must oppose this proposal.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach three questions. First, in respect of the Morris tribunal, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised a ringing apology to the McBrearty family. When can the House expect to hear it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Legislation was introduced to set up the Morris tribunal and there are serious consequences in respect of that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="446"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise. What is the Deputy&rsquo;s second question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The bogus confession is a serious and central issue for the tribunal. Before the House rises, will it hear statements from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform giving the ringing apology to the McBrearty family to which he has committed himself on the issue of the bogus confession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business. Does the Deputy have a third question?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="447"/>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>My second question pertains to the ongoing negotiations between the European Union and the United States on an open skies policy. Will the Taoiseach fund a professional study on the impact on the mid-west and west region? Some 40,000 people are employed by American companies in that region.</P>
      <P>When will we see the natural gas regulation Bill which was expected to be published in 2005? Will the Government take an interest in the fact that tomorrow a number of people face jail sentences because of confusion and lack of clarity in respect of the Government policy being implemented in regard to the Corrib gas field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will raise the issue of Shannon with the line Minister. The natural gas regulation Bill will give effect to the restructuring of the natural gas industry. It is being drafted and is due in the first half of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it proposed to bring the Abbotstown Campus Development Authority Bill before the House? I remind the Taoiseach of his commitment that the work permits Bill would be through the House this session, but it has not even been published. Obviously, it will not be moved in this session so will the Taoiseach indicate when it will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Abbotstown Campus Development Authority Bill will be brought before the House in the autumn session. I said we would try to take the work permits legislation this session but it will be published tomorrow and will be taken in the autumn session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Government contemplating any amendment to the prompt payments legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question appropriate to the Order of Business? There are a number of Deputies offering and we cannot go on too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The diplomatic relations and immunities amendment Bill is on the minds of people, particularly since the husband of Ingrid Betancourt, the presidential candidate in Colombia, is in the Public Gallery. She had been in captivity for over 40 months and is one of thousands in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We must move on to the next question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a matter on which the Government will allow statements? Will the legislation be published to allow us to debate such matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That Bill was approved by the Cabinet today and it will be published shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the fact that An Bord Altranais deals with applications by nurses for registration, when will we see the relevant promised legislation because it now takes up to eight months to process applications for registration? There is a shortage of nurses in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I should learn a lesson from this not to recommit an amendment. Before we adjourned, I set out my concerns with the approach proposed in the amendment by Deputy Gilmore. After every census, the Central Statistics Office publishes the results on a phased basis. Volume 1, containing the population classified by area, has the necessary final data to enable a constituency commission to review constituencies in accordance with the relevant legislation, the Constitution and case law. The CSO publishes a preliminary report a number of months after a census, but it contains provisional information which is subject to revision and which is not regarded as having any statutory force.</P>
      <P>While there is always a possibility of legal challenge in matters relating to constitutional law, I am satisfied that it would not be the correct approach to ask the commission to operate and to make recommendations on a basis other than the final census results. Neither should the Oireachtas be asked to evaluate a commission report prepared on such a basis. The approach we are following reflects the statutory requirement since enactment of the Electoral Act 1997 and the practice extending back over a much longer period.</P>
      <P>The case law in the area supports the approach we are following. For these reasons, I do not favour using the initial figures for a revision of constituencies as would be required by the terms of the proposed amendment. I suggest to the Deputy that he does not press the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very much in unknown territory. We have a Bill before us which will set down the constituency boundaries in line with the 2002 census and the report of the boundary commission arising from that. We know that there will be a census in 2006 and that the preliminary figures on that census will be published around July 2006. We expect, based on what is already known to the CSO, that the 2006 census will show a population increase of about 250,000. I referred earlier to the degree to which that is likely to give rise to changes in the boundaries of constituencies. It is likely that the constituency of Louth will have the same population as the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan after 2006, yet Louth will have four seats while Cavan-Monaghan will have five. In her contribution, Deputy Catherine Murphy pointed out that it is likely the 2006 census will show that the existing Kildare North constituency <Col N="453"/>will have exceeded the one Deputy per 30,000 ratio set out in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very buoyant in his belief that the legislation before us is robust enough to withstand any legal challenge against it. The truth is that he does not know &mdash; none of us knows &mdash; what will happen if a case goes before the courts. In my opinion, there is a high likelihood that a case will end up before the courts on this issue. The court will be exercised about two issues. First, there is a difference between the provisional figures and the official figures. The figures available around July 2006 will be the provisional census figures. We know from experience that the provisional census figures and the official census figures do not differ much. On the last occasion, the total difference was about 130 people in the entire country.</P>
      <P>Second, we must look at what is required by the Constitution. Article 16.2.3&deg; of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What does the word &ldquo;ascertained&rdquo; mean in the context of this article? Does it mean the publication of the official census figures, or does it mean that once the information is available from the census returns that it has been ascertained? I imagine that the courts might spend some time addressing what that exactly means. We are making the legislation in the almost certain knowledge that this Bill, once enacted, will be challenged if an election is not held before the census figures for 2006 are available.</P>
      <P>In such circumstances, two issues arise. First, we are obliged to comply with the Constitution. We are obliged to ensure that no constituency exceeds one Deputy per 30,000 people. We are obliged to ensure that the ratio should be, as far as is practicable, the same throughout the country. We are heading into a situation where we know that the ratios are not the same. We know that there has been significant population movement, especially on the eastern side of the country, which will give rise to dramatic changes in the ratios between the number of Deputies and population. It is not wise for the Oireachtas to make legislation knowing that it is creating a situation at the next general election where that ratio will be skewed.</P>
      <P>Second, if the 2006 population figures are known before the next general election and they show the skewed nature of the representation or that the maximum limit provided by the Constitution has been exceeded, somebody will inevitably take a case to the courts. We will be creating a set of circumstances where we will have a case before the courts in the run up to a general election. That will create much uncertainty if the courts decide that this Bill, as enacted, does not <Col N="454"/>pass muster as far as the Constitution is concerned. If a decision is made in the High Court in late 2006 or early 2007 that declares the 2005 Act is unconstitutional based on what has been ascertained in the census, we will all be wondering what will happen next. Will it be appealed? If it is, it will be taken closer to the wire. If the outcome of an appeal upholds a decision that the 2005 Act is unconstitutional, what can be done? Will the Minister have to establish a new boundary commission and revise constituencies on the hoof? It should be remembered that on the last occasion a major case on electoral issues was taken, the High Court handed down its decision the day before polling. If that happens again, the question of the status of a D&aacute;il elected on foot of an Act the court has found to be unconstitutional will arise.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because we are in uncertain and unprecedented territory. The next census will probably reflect the most significant ever changes over a short period in population in Ireland, with attendant consequences for constituency boundaries. It would be prudent of the House to take that on board. I bring my concerns to the attention of the House because it is not good enough for the Minister to simply say that he is satisfied the legislation will withstand any legal test. Not only does he not know whether it will do so but there have been countless instances in which legislation passed by the House has been found by the courts, within a short period, to be defective. We do not know what the courts will decide because they make their decisions independently of the House. They may present us with a political crisis if a decision is made too late to establish an independent commission to revise constituency boundaries.</P>
      <P>We know what we know now and have a fair idea of what the 2006 census will tell us. As my amendment seeks, we should anticipate its findings by making provisions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened at length to the arguments made by Deputy Gilmore. Whatever we know now, however, it is certain that if we proceed on the basis of preliminary figures we know to be imperfect and subject to revision, we will face a legal challenge. This is not the first time the issue has been dealt with by a Minister. On the previous occasion, Deputy Howlin was the Minister who steered the Electoral Act 1997 through the Oireachtas. As the 1997 Act introduced into law a practice which had extended back over a longer period, it is untrue to contend we are in unfounded territory. Deputy Gilmore was pleased to vote in favour of Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s legislation.</P>
      <P>The long-standing practice provided for in the 1997 Act is continued in my Bill. There is also case law, as I pointed out on the previous occasion on which we discussed the matter. I again draw the attention of the House to the decision of Mr. Justice Budd in 1961, as set out on page 119 of the Irish Reports, which could not <Col N="455"/>be clearer. According to Mr. Justice Budd, while the preliminary figures of the 1946 census were provided in the case he was judging, it is the final figures to which regard must be had for the proper purposes of comparison with the distribution of population. While Deputy Gilmore was correct to say that the final figure for the total population in the most recent census did not vary greatly from the preliminary figure, he was wrong to suggest that there were not variances at the micro level at which constituency boundaries are discussed.</P>
      <P>Variances at the constituency level can be significant. There should be no great difference in the first and last figures for the overall population if enumerators have been doing their jobs. The final figures on which the Oireachtas has always depended are precise and they deal exclusively with the data below electoral division level. I refer here, for example, to the figures relating to townlands. The CSO is adamant that the preliminary figures do not have a statutory basis and that it cannot provide the detailed information on which boundary commissions depend until Volume 1 is published. One can never suggest that there will be no legal challenge in respect of a matter which has touched on constitutional issues, one can only follow the long-standing practice. In this instance, that practice has been to use the final, precise census figures.</P>
      <P>In the context of hypotheses as to whether there will be a legal challenge, it is far more likely that one will be successful if we go forward on the basis of the imprecise, preliminary figures. It would not be right or proper to request a commission to use those figures. If one were to operate on the basis Deputy Gilmore suggests only to find the final figures to outline significant differences below the electoral division level, one would face a real crisis. The best practice is that which has operated for a long time. This was put into law by Deputy Howlin in the 1997 Act and it accords with precedent in case law, two examples of which I have recorded. It would not only be imprudent and dangerous to accept the amendment, it would be reckless. On those bases, I cannot accept it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P><Col N="456"/>
      <P LI="2">2.&mdash;Section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 is amended by the insertion after &lsquo;five&rsquo; of &lsquo;(or where necessary to avoid the breaching of a county boundary, six)&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Amendment No. 2 arises from Committee Stage, on which we addressed in particular the issue of County Leitrim and the sense of grievance that it is being divided. One part of the county is to be included in a Sligo-Leitrim constituency, while the other will be included in a Roscommon-Leitrim constituency. Amendment No. 2 seeks to provide terms of reference to the next boundary commission to allow it to recommend constituencies of six members where it is necessary to avoid the breaching of a county boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of amendments before the House on specific constituencies. Leitrim is the key to amendment No. 2 and was the subject of lengthy debate on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 6 addresses in principle the need to put in place the infrastructure to allow the commission to deal with constituencies in a broader sense. It seeks to provide that each constituency shall return three, four, five, six or seven Members. Meath and Kerry are two of a number of constituencies which would be affected by the amendment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I seek to achieve a greater degree of proportionality per constituent, while retaining the integrity of the constituency boundaries. While constituencies which accord to county boundaries are more common in rural areas, the principle is also relevant to Dublin where almost all of the constituencies north of the Liffey contain three seats and most of those south of it are five seaters. It is ironic that after partition in the early 1920s, we had constituencies with up to nine Deputies. In spite of the turbulence of that period, the founders of the State saw fit to put in place constituencies offering significant proportionality in terms of representation. Unfortunately, Governments on both sides of Britain&rsquo;s border in Ireland have since sought to employ deliberately negative electoral engineering policies with which we are all familiar such as gerrymandering in the North and Tullymandering in the South. Notwithstanding all of this, the issue of real import in my amendment is that of proportionality. That is the crucial element.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that the concept of four seat, five seat and even six seat and seven seat constituencies is not that new. In the North all constituencies of the Legislative Assembly are six seaters. That position is fully supported by the Government for which I commend it but why can we not have the same level of proportionality here? The greater the number of seats in a constituency, the greater the level of proportionality. The division of County Meath into two three seat constituencies is a perfect example of this, as is the division of County Kerry into two three seat constituencies. Now we have this ludicrous proposal regarding the division of County Leitrim <Col N="457"/>into two parts, each of which would be linked to two other constituencies. Surely one large constituency would be preferable? This could involve a six seat constituency of Sligo-Leitrim or a constituency of Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon with a greater number of seats. That is what I am trying to achieve in the amendment.</P>
      <P>My aim is not to be prescriptive. A number of the other amendments are prescriptive in dealing with the issue of County Leitrim alone. What I seek to achieve through my amendment is to give the constituency commission terms of reference which would facilitate a detailed examination of all of the constituencies and allow it to arrive at a conclusion that would take on board the level of proportionality involved while maintaining the integrity of county boundaries. As I have illustrated, this can be carried through in the case of cities like Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when we examine the case of Dublin, it is inexplicable that there is a host of three seat constituencies on one side of the river while there are a number of five seat constituencies across it. I do not object to five seat constituencies on the south side but greater proportionality should be afforded on the north side also. This should apply throughout the State wherever there is a lack of proportionality.</P>
      <P>We must amend the legislation to facilitate the constituency commission in carrying out its work more effectively. I do not wish to be prescriptive about any constituency but we should give the commission a framework that would allow it to do its work as an independent body more broadly. I look forward with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments. Reference has been made to the population shift. If one goes back to the 1920s, one will find that County Kildare had a population of 50,000, the same as County Leitrim. In the intervening years the population of County Kildare has more than doubled while that of County Leitrim has halved. That is an accurate, although extreme, example of what has been occurring.</P>
      <P>If we look at the projections for 2030 from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, we will see that the population of the greater Dublin area will grow by up to 50%. In that context, would it not be reasonable to look at larger constituencies, whether it is six seat or seven seat constituencies, so as to cater for population shift? This issue will not go away. I will not become political, other than to say that if we had balanced regional development and were achieving what is included in the national development plan, we might not need to have this debate. We are certainly not striking a balance in terms of population.</P>
      <P>Two or three years ago when the CSO published population projections for 2030 &mdash; it has done so again recently and revised the figures upwards &mdash; it described it as a wake-up call for the Government. It was saying something for the CSO to make such a statement but as I said, that <Col N="458"/>is the situation in which we find ourselves. The issue will not go away. Therefore, from that perspective, surely we need to look at larger constituencies because that would give the commission flexibility to try to ensure the maintenance of county boundaries.</P>
      <P>We do not need to maintain all county boundaries. County Meath which has been mentioned could become a six seat constituency. If one wanted to do it on a trial basis, one could easily have put Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon together as one six seat constituency with County Meath as another. That would have been feasible but it has been decided to split them into two three seat constituencies. The issue of splitting County Meath relates to proportionality and representation which is another argument but the splitting of County Leitrim is a very different issue. As we heard in the D&aacute;il today, the ratio is 1:30,000 and the population of County Leitrim is just in excess of 25,000. Therefore, if one splits the county for electoral purposes, it is almost guaranteed that there will not be a Deputy living in the county, particularly because of the way it is being split. The splitting of county boundaries is an issue nationally but the particular issue I wish to deal with is the splitting of County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Has the commission taken demographic shifts into consideration? Has it made any request to the Minister or the Department seeking larger six seat or seven seat constituencies to allow it to adhere to its guidelines? The guidelines indicate that county boundaries should not be breached where practicable. Given of the demographic shift, I know, as does the Minister and the commission, that as time passes, it will not just be County Leitrim that will be split; other small counties will also be split. The creation of larger constituencies would provide a solution to avoid this. Has there been any communication from the boundary commission about larger constituencies to enable it to carry out its functions more effectively and adhere to its current guidelines?</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the constituencies of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland, all of which are six seaters. I heard the Minister say in the House that maximum proportional representation would be achieved if we had one single constituency, with which I agree, but that is not practicable, as the Minister and I are both aware. Let us look to Northern Ireland where six seat constituencies are in operation and have worked. In general, people appear to be happy with the proportional nature of their representation. Why should we have a six seat constituency on one side of the Border in County Fermanagh that delivers proportional representation to its electorate and on the other side County Leitrim is forced into two three seat constituencies that will not deliver the same level of proportionality? Most importantly, it will probably not deliver a Deputy who lives in the county. I support both amendments.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="459"/>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two issues of importance, the first of which is the fact that a report has been produced. It is an independent report commissioned by the Government but with the consent of everybody. When one sets up an independent commission to do a job, one cannot really disagree with its results because it cannot be argued that it acted impartially or did not follow its terms of reference. It is not just the present Government that has commissioned such reports because previous Administrations have done so since the famous Tullymander in the early 1970s. It is not that there was not a political carve-up of constituencies prior to that period; of course there was such a carve-up.</P>
      <P>As a democratic Parliament, the Houses have given the power to an independent commission to do the job for us and we have given it its terms of reference. It has followed them to the best of its ability and we are left with the result, warts and all. That is the reality we must face. Much of the debate on these amendments really focuses on the next round, namely, what will happen when the next commission is set up and the terms of reference it ought to be given.</P>
      <P>I accept the argument in principle that one should be able to elect a Deputy for one&rsquo;s area. The county system has been in existence for centuries. In the modern world, however, and certainly on the east coast of Ireland, it does not really make much sense. People want effective representation and want their representatives to be as near to them as possible. This is the issue on the east coast. East Meath is a fast growing area and there are approximately 3,000 or 4,000 more people living there than there were five years ago. These people send their children to school in Drogheda in the constituency of Louth and also do their shopping there. All of the services they want and need are available in a different constituency. The proposed constituency seems to enfranchise the people of east Meath, particularly those on the outskirts of Drogheda. Bearing in mind that the county boundary was formed hundreds of years ago, a different formula is needed so that the point of view of these people can be represented politically by those who understand it and who address every day the problems they face. As the Minister knows, I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter today. There was not enough time for him to answer it in the House but I hope I will be delighted with the reply.</P>
      <P>There are two trends of note. There is a shift of population from rural to urban areas &mdash; including massive growth in the city of Dublin and its environs &mdash; and depopulation in the west. I agree with the Deputies from the west who contend that if we had a national spatial strategy that worked, this problem would be addressed. Frank McDonald of <i>The Irish Times</i> stated recently that Ireland is fast becoming a city state involving the city of Dublin and nowhere else. I agree that serious issues pertaining to the national spatial strategy have not been addressed by the Govern<Col N="460"/>ment. The continued creation of industry and jobs in and around the city of Dublin does not make sense. We should be developing the west, building transport corridors, including rail corridors, and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I take the point that Leitrim is a small county. Its population is smaller than that of Drogheda. There are more people living in my town of Drogheda than there are in the whole of County Longford. An agreement has been signed with the consent of the Department implying that Drogheda&rsquo;s water and sewerage systems can sustain 104,000 people. However, the county manager expects the population to grow to 140,000 in the next five to ten years. There are, therefore, significant pressures on the east coast which we have not been able to resist.</P>
      <P>When further changes to constituency boundaries are considered, we should consider the trans-county boundary issue on the east coast. The county boundary is not as important as it clearly is in rural areas with declining populations. Perhaps we should re-examine the terms of reference of the boundary commission. The Government&rsquo;s national spatial strategy should be revisited and reorganised to focus on those areas.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael cannot support the two amendments because the die is cast, the commission has sat and issued its report. We are not going to change it, notwithstanding the concerns that have been expressed. However, there are issues pertaining to constituency boundaries that are not being addressed by way of Government policy. The time to resolve these issues is after the next election, not now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the opposite view to Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on amendments Nos. 2 and 6 which are very important. We need discussion and debate and we need to open our eyes to the scam that is being perpetrated. It is an absolute disgrace in terms of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. As stated previously, the legislation is flawed and undemocratic. It should be thrown out. These amendments represent an attempt to bring democracy back into this State.</P>
      <P>In considering the debates on three seat, five seat and six seat constituencies, anybody with a bit of vision will realise that three seat constituencies are a disaster for democracy. They suit the larger parties. That is the reality and it was exposed during this debate.</P>
      <P>What is the exact position on three seat and five seat constituencies in the Dublin area? Most of the latter have been created on the south side of the Liffey, while many of the former have been created on the north side. The commission could easily have created a five seat constituency and four seat constituency on the north side but instead it took a very conservative view. I speak as a Deputy from Dublin North Central, where it is proposed to remove one seat so that it will become a three seat constituency. Many people on the north side are very angry about this. It will backfire on the larger parties in the next general <Col N="461"/>election. It is very important that the Minister recognises this.</P>
      <P>I wish to address a couple of myths in the legislation. The amendments deal with reality. The commission removed from my constituency &mdash; Dublin North Central &mdash; 5,280 people, in the Edenmore area, and 5,020 people, in the Beaumont-Whitehall. The commission was established under the 1997 Act. It has five members but its terms of reference were given to it by the Government. It was appointed by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, whose track record on previous issues we know. The citizens of the State have major concerns about the narrowness of the terms of reference. On researching the issue, I noted that the commission held only ten meetings to discuss the election process and decide on the future of democratic elections in constituencies throughout the State. The Independent group would have ten meetings on smaller issues. It is interesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern &mdash; Wonderboy or Superman, as he should be known &mdash; was given back Drumcondra and Whitehall. This poses an interesting question.</P>
      <P>The Minister will know that the population of Dublin is exploding. If one goes down O&rsquo;Connell Street this evening, one will see the amount of people and the traffic congestion but the commission has recommended that the number of Deputies remain at 166. It could easily have recommended 168. This would have made the democratic system more democratic and inclusive. We are to have 43 constituencies but will still have only 166 Deputies. There are to be 18 three-seat constituencies, which is absolutely amazing. In Dublin, with its expanding population, there are 47 Deputies. The commission could easily have recommended that this be increased to 48 or 49 in light of the population explosion.</P>
      <P>I raise these issues regarding the amendments because there is a broader issue to be considered. Our citizens deserve respect and equality. A new debate is starting in respect of the census to be held in 2006, which will lead to further developments. If the Government is serious about democracy, on which we get many political lectures in this House, voting rights and citizenship, it should give serious consideration to amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Morgan, which is positive and progressive. It is also important because we are looking at the democratic interests of the State. Those who back the Minister may think they are pulling a smart one with regard to constituencies and trying to squeeze out smaller parties and independent candidates. However, it will backfire on them and people have already spotted what they are doing. Many credible people in the other parties with a genuine interest in democracy and the inclusive development of politics have also seen it.</P>
      <P>Overall, the Bill is flawed, out of date and undemocratic. It is an absolute disgrace for a Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to present such amendments and legislation to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I have rarely heard such self-serving nonsense in the House. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd made a very honest contribution in which he said that if we were to make the change now, it would not have the effect in County Leitrim suggested by a number of contributors. However, it would mean that the commission would be re-established and more detailed legislation would be required. The law currently provides for the establishment of a commission on the publication of a census but no census results have yet been published. Therefore, we would have to revisit the legislation, re-establish the commission and give it different terms of reference.</P>
      <P>If we were to abandon the commission&rsquo;s report and go back to the bad old days, we would hear other specious arguments. We would certainly hear more legitimate arguments. We abandoned the idea of a political redrafting of constituency boundaries to suit the Administration of the day and it would be an extremely retrograde step to return to it. It would be a step backwards to return to the bad old days. We set up a commission and gave it its terms of reference in law. Therefore, it would be dishonest to suggest that we should tear up the entire practice and return to where we were. It is not a practical approach and would not have the effect the Deputy seeks.</P>
      <P>The constituency commission&rsquo;s terms of reference are clearly set out in the legislation and in my speech on Second Stage. Section 6(2) of the Electoral Act 1997 includes requirements for three, four and five seat constituencies and deals with the issue of breaches of county boundaries. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd made a very valid point with regard to the so-called sacrosanct constituency boundaries.</P>

	<P>Deputy McGrath comes in to the House and tries to shout me down when I want to outline the facts and tell the truth. If he was better prepared, he would not need to resort to such gutter tactics.</P>
      <P>The legislation enacted in 1997 provides for three, four and five seat constituencies. It is wrong for Deputies to come in to the House and impute that somehow or other those who formed the commission could have varied the law. They could not. Deputy Harkin legitimately asked a specific question as to whether they had been in contact? The answer is no because they were operating within the law as it stood. It would not <Col N="463"/>be normal for them to communicate back and make such a query.</P>
      <P>From time to time the commission&rsquo;s recommendations have been criticised for not keeping to county boundaries. I represent a constituency which has experienced every conceivable variation. At one time parts of County Wicklow were included with County Dublin, parts of County Kildare and County Carlow. There have been other variations in the past. Much of the debate surrounding the Bill has focused on the breaching of the boundaries of County Leitrim resulting from the commission&rsquo;s proposals. I can fully understand the way in which people in Couinty Leitrim feel about the matter. In some areas there is an attachment to county boundaries, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd pointed out.</P>
      <P>The county boundaries issue is not as pressing in other areas. In places such as Drogheda the contiguous area affines all of its connections in Drogheda. One could more legitimately argue that in such circumstances the county boundaries should be breached. There is also case law in this regard such as the judgment of Mr. Justice Budd in the O&rsquo;Donovan case. He stated that although in the main a system based on counties had been adopted, there was nothing in the Constitution about constituencies having to be based on county boundaries. This is true because the last of the counties, County Wicklow, was formed in 1604. Some parts identify more with County Wexford than other parts of County Wicklow. Mr. Justice Budd also stated the Constitution did not state that in forming constituencies according to the required ratio it should be done as far as was practicable having regard to county boundaries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morgan made a practical point about connectedness between the electorate and the elected representative. If we look at his amendment, we are talking about a larger constituency. Deputy Harkin is right. The logic of a large constituency is that there would be one single constituency because there would be absolute proportionality. Why stop at seven? Let us consider the impact of a six or seven seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will support the Minister if he wants to amend the legislation to allow for more seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with that issue. Let us look at the practical impact of what the Deputy is proposing on constituencies with a population greater than 150,000. From the point of view of what the Deputy has brought forward, connectedness between the elected representative and the electorate is not wise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking of proportionality, not connectedness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is disputing the argument that there is a connection between the <Col N="464"/>elected representative and the person he or she represents, which is the very essence of democracy. I am sure the Deputy is not attacking it.</P>
      <P>There would be an electorate of more than 170,000 in a seven seat constituency. However, that is not the best or most practical way to proceed. There would be an issue with regard to distances in handling a constituency of that size. Deputy Harkin is also an MEP and can attest to the practical problems which arise.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a more important point, given the current debate. There could be a potential sense of political alienation in such circumstances. There is already a sense of <i>ennui</i>, a point on which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd touched. There is a problem if we say that the old constituency boundaries which were drawn up between the 12th and 17th centuries, should form the basis on which we should deal with today&rsquo;s democratic units. We would risk alienating many and create a sense of futility with regard to politics. Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd is right.</P>
      <P>Bray, County Wicklow, has a population of 32,000 and is larger than some of the constituencies about which we are talking. Parts of the town are in Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s constituency. The identification of area is changing, the point made by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd. If Deputies were to think long and hard about the issue, they would realise that in suggesting a much larger constituency, they would contribute to a greater sense of alienation and removal of the population from their political representatives.</P>
      <P>We must be fair to the commission. I am angered at the suggestion that it has somehow been motivated by political prejudice. That does a disservice to its members. Before throwing mud of that nature, one should think of the implications. When one chooses to throw mud at those who have served the people well and operated within the law, one undermines the very democratic principles that should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a completely perverse view. After a period when politicians drafted the constituency boundaries, we decided, wisely, to depoliticise that particular issue. It was decided by consensus across the political parties. There has been much comment on this issue of late, including contributions from Dr. Garret FitzGerald.</P>
      <P>It is not proper for Deputy Finian McGrath to cast aspersions on the integrity of the people who made the decision or the basis on which it was made. It is quite legitimate, of course, to criticise the decision and I am not suggesting otherwise. It was very light handed of the Deputy to dismiss the Minister of State as being Superman, although I believe the Minister of State is a super man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State is a good example of a hard-working constituency Deputy.</P>
      <P>One cannot be &agrave; la carte on this issue. One cannot say that one does not want the large political parties to make decisions on constituency boundaries and then say one does not like the alternative either. No cogent argument has been put forward for a radical departure from the arrangements that have been in operation for a considerable period. Constituencies restricted to three, four or five seats have been a fact of life as long as I have been on the planet.</P>

	<P>They have been in operation since the election of 1947, which is more years than I care to remember. The arrangements have applied for over 50 years and they strike a better balance than the alternatives that preceded them.</P>
      <P>I must make a point to Deputy Morgan and, in fact, I cannot avoid doing so. His espousal of the system that obtained in this country in 1922 overlooks the minor fact that it was our former imperial masters who dictated the arrangements that we inherited at that time. Whatever else motivated our former imperial masters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that. Fair dues to Deputy Morgan. What I was about to say is that whatever else motivated our former imperial masters, it was not the well-being of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the Minister, I was also struck by the degree to which Deputy Morgan was harking back to the days of the Free State for a formula for organising the constituencies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harkin mentioned the issue of population change and population decline in particular. An analysis of the census of 2002 &mdash; the phenomenon may be replicated in the 2006 census &mdash; reveals that the areas where population is declining are the expensive inner suburbs of the cities. In my constituency there has been a significant population decline. In areas such as Blackrock, for example, the population is declining for a simple reason, namely, the fact that housing has become too expensive, young families cannot afford to live there and regeneration is not taking place. This is possibly an issue for another day <Col N="466"/>but it is a problem to which we have yet to face up. Population decline is not occurring in the places where it used to occur.</P>
      <P>My amendment attempts to address a situation where a county boundary needs to be retained. If one takes the example of County Wicklow, it is likely that when the 2006 census results are published, the county may justify having six seats rather than its current allocation of five. If that is the case, and under the existing legislation, Wicklow will have to be divided in some way. It could be divided into two three seat constituencies or perhaps some other formula could be agreed upon. It would make sense for a commission to have the option to examine the possibility of retaining the county&rsquo;s integrity. It would be useful if it had a greater degree of latitude in its decision-making. Where six seats would solve the problem, the commission would not then have to divide the county with all of the discontinuity that can entail. My amendment simply seeks to allow for a degree of latitude.</P>
      <P>On the question of proportionality and larger numbers of seats, it depends on one&rsquo;s starting point. If an individual or party is on 12% of the vote, then one could say that winning one seat in a seven seat constituency is proportionate. However, if that rises to 20% of the vote in a seven seat constituency and still only one seat is won, then it is no longer proportionate. Proportionality depends on one&rsquo;s starting point. It is not necessarily the case that larger numbers of seats confer greater proportionality, particularly in terms of political parties rather than individuals. One could have, for example, a four seat and a three seat constituency side by side that might be merged into a seven seat constituency. There might be two independent candidates from each of the original constituencies who would then find themselves in the same seven seat constituency. That might not be the most comfortable arrangement and it might not produce the kind of proportionate results that people seek. Proportionality has a lot to do with perception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>First, for the purpose of clarity, I wish to categorically state I never had imperialist masters. While there may have been occupiers in this country, they certainly were not my masters. I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s description of them as such.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore has just commented on the issue of proportionality but I am disappointed that the person to whom I directed my question, namely, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, did not deal with the issue. Proportionality is central to the argument I am making.</P>
      <P>I have never challenged the independence of the commission. My amendment attempts to put terms of reference in place which will broaden the scope of the commission and that issue was not adequately addressed by the Minister&rsquo;s comments either.</P><Col N="467"/>
      <P>As I am aware that we are pressed for time and that other Deputies wish to contribute to the debate, I will ask only one question of the Minister. In the event that the census is held next year, the results are published in January 2007 but the general election is not held until May 2007, will the Minister reappoint the constituency commission in the intervening months? At that point, the scenario referred to by Deputy Gilmore may be clear and it may be obvious that proportionality is not in place. What would happen in that event?</P>

      <P>I have been in Leinster House for 23 years and seen many things. I am aware of the job that the commission must do and understand why it has to do its work. The redrawing of boundaries started in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Mayo and then affected County Westmeath. I understand why north-west Meath was put back in with the rest of the county. If part of a county must be divided, I do not think any Minister should preside over the division of a parish but my parish has been divided in two. In Castlepollard my brother 400 yards to the right of my home can vote for me but I cannot vote for myself. Neither can my mother. No one living in a rural area which takes up one third of the county can vote for me. Raharney, a small village of 230 people, has also been divided in two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This division is wrong. An area&rsquo;s identity, ethos and culture have been completely removed.

	<P>I agree with the Minister; it was absolutely right to depoliticise the issue of constituency boundaries but the guidelines can be changed. While the commission is an independent body, this House is in a position to change the guidelines. I am asking the Minister to do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore spoke about proportionality. I am not an expert on the matter but it seems that it depends on where one is coming from. The Deputy referred to two constituencies, a three seater and a four seater with an Independent Deputy in each who might not like to be joined in a seven seater. However, this is not about Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il or Independent Deputies but the electorate.</P>

	<P>The issue of county boundaries came to light when County Leitrim was split. Following the 1977 general election the county did not have a TD resident in it. This caused outrage at the time and a major campaign was begun, as a result of which one of the guidelines about not breaching county boundaries, where practicable, was inserted into the legislation but now in 2005 we are right back where we started and making the same mistakes again. We seem to be moving backward instead of forward. At one point in the 1940s I think there were three County Leitrim TDs in a seven seat constituency but now the county is facing the prospect that in a three seat constituency there may be no TD living in the county. This is a disenfranchisement of the people of County Leitrim. It is almost saying that because the county is so small it really does not matter. The 2002 census showed that there were 25,799 people living there. I advise the Minister that if County Leitrim is split, it will almost certainly lose a resident TD. I ask him to look again at the legislation and amend it to ensure the county will have a reasonable chance of having a resident TD.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, given the meeting of the leaders of the G8 countries being held in Edinburgh, Scotland and given subsequent meetings being held for the UN Millennium Summit in New York and meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in September 2005 and the World Trade Organisation Ministerial conference in December 2005, calls on the Government through its own policies to assist in making poverty history and to this end:</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s policy of supporting 100% debt cancellation for heavily indebted poor countries, going beyond the inadequate, though welcome, proposal of the G8 group of nations to restrict such cancellation to a list of 18 countries; and</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>that such debt cancellation should not be accompanied by damaging conditions which would erode the benefits of cancellation;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>that such cancellation should be funded out of additional moneys, supporting the views of non-governmental organisations that International Monetary Fund gold reserves be sold to help finance debt cancellation; and</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>that developed nations move away from operating as both judge and plaintiff in relation to heavily indebted poor countries;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>recognises that debt cancellation is only part of what is needed to assist heavily indebted poor countries and that targeted and untied aid must continue to be given and significantly increased;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>resolves to agree a new target date in view of the Government&rsquo;s acknowledgement that it will not meet its commitment to reach 0.7% of GNP to be devoted to overseas development aid by 2007;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>calls on the Taoiseach to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to this target at the forthcoming UN Millennium Summit;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>further recognises the importance of fair trade in bringing about international social justice;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>demands re-examination of subsidies given to producers in the developed world and the effect of such subsidies <Col N="472"/>on their counterparts in less developed nations;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>calls on the Government to support a reappraisal of the European Union&rsquo;s economic partnership agreements with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries in light of serious concerns that they would inhibit rather than promote the economic development of those countries;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _dc20-?><?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>acknowledges the need to restrict the international trade in arms in order to assist conflict resolution and prevent the terrible cost in human lives and attendant economic costs of such trade;</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>calls on the Government to strongly support the initiative being taken by the Government of Finland to bring about an arms trade treaty through the framework of the United Nations; and</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>resolves that the Government, in the upcoming renegotiation of the Kyoto agreement, support a fair distribution of carbon allocation on a <i>per capita </i>basis in view of the increasing convergence between the issues of environmental degradation and world poverty, as evidenced by the fact that the costs of climate change are being disproportionately borne by the world&rsquo;s poorest people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P el="5" FLI="0">In introducing this motion we had hoped a collective opinion might go from this House to meet what we hope is a global gathering of minds on issues of world poverty. As matters stand, an important meeting of the G8 group of countries will take place this weekend in Scotland. However, as this House will not reconvene until the end of September, this debate presents an opportunity to the Government to outline policy positions as regards other international gatherings that will address these important policy issues, namely, the meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in September. Probably the most important of all is the UN Millennium Summit also to be held in September in New York.</P>
      <P>It was at a previous UN meeting that the Taoiseach made the promise that Ireland would meet the commitment of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, in overseas development aid by 2007. It is greatly disappointing that the Government has since stated it cannot meet this commitment. It is particularly frustrating that it has not indicated by what date it intends to meet this target. It is with a great deal of disillusionment that many of us behold the failure to put in place any mechanisms to reach this target as we address the motion.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate we intend to cover the five most pertinent issues at the meetings mentioned. They include the important concepts of aid, trade and debt cancellation; the crucial <Col N="473"/>need to put the brakes on the pernicious global trade in arms; the linking of issues of social justice with environmental degradation, and the need to adopt a truly global position on issues of climate change. Each of my party colleagues and I hope other Members will address these issues on an individual level.</P>
      <P>I will begin by talking about what seems to be the main issue that will come from the G8 summit next weekend. A preliminary meeting has indicated that a deal has been reached on debt cancellation. Many of those involved in development work have indicated that it is an important first step. It must be acknowledged, however, that the deal is limited to 18 countries and that there is a degree of conditionality as regards how the debt will be met. There is a great deal of uncertainty about whether the debt being cancelled will be dealt with through existing aid budgets or through new funding mechanisms as proposed by many NGOs, namely, the sale of the International Monetary Fund gold reserves. If we get this wrong at the outset, we could be in danger of putting the cause of alleviating global poverty back even further.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the issue has been talked about for several decades on many levels since the end of the Second World War. During that period, however, we have seen a doubling of the distance in terms of overall wealth between the wealthiest countries in the world and the 20% of countries at the other end of the scale. There has been enough talk, meetings and summits. Those who care about these issues and, more importantly, those affected by them daily hope the series of meetings which will take place next week and beyond will, at last, provide the opportunity for which people in the developing world have been waiting.</P>
      <P>In addressing these issues in their totality we are, for once, reviewing more pertinent matters than we ordinarily deal with in this House on a regular basis. These are issues of grave international importance. While at times we get caught up in the pantomime of name calling and point scoring about individual political positions in this Chamber to do with our system of politics, we had hoped in tabling the motion that there would be a consensus of views, with the House speaking collectively. Unfortunately, the Government&rsquo;s amendment, in effect, amounts to a new motion. It carries too much self-aggrandisement to be regarded as a serious attempt to deal with the issues involved. Possibly, during the course of the debate other contributions and the potential for further amendments might see by the end of tomorrow&rsquo;s business a coming together of views in order that this House may at least send a message that those outside this Chamber want to hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>At this morning&rsquo;s press conference to launch this Private Members&rsquo; motion some of my colleagues wanted to give the Government the benefit of the doubt. They expressed the view that it might accept our <Col N="474"/>motion because it was so reasonable. I disagreed as I believed it would table an amendment. It has done so and gutted our motion. It shows a sense of cynicism &mdash; the type displayed when the Taoiseach went before the United Nations and gave a solemn commitment to the world&rsquo;s poorest nations, on which he has since reneged. At the U2 concert at the weekend when his name was mentioned, he was deservedly booed by the crowd. Most Irish people recognise that it was a cynical ploy in order to become a member of the Security Council. It was a matter of prestige for this country. The Government achieved its aim of securing a seat on the Security Council but, unfortunately, did not do very much with it at the time and now we are left with this empty promise. Based on the Government&rsquo;s figures, we will achieve a figure of 0.43% of GNP by 2007. We will not achieve our goal of 0.7% which we will achieve at current rates by 2028.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look at what is happening in our world. Some 8,000 die of AIDS-HIV related illnesses every single day. The first millennium development goal, to achieve gender parity by 2005, will not be reached. We need an extra &euro;50 billion to reach the UN millennium development goals. It simply will not happen.</P>
      <P>Next September the Taoiseach will once again go before the United Nations in New York. What will he do on this occasion? It is clear from the amendment tabled by the Government that it does not want to make any serious commitment. That is the difficulty. We have a problem with our credibility. We wanted the Government to produce a new timetable. However, such a timetable is absent from the motion. We had hoped that before we broke up for the summer recess, since we will not have an opportunity to debate the issue before the Taoiseach leaves for New York, we might get some indication. Perhaps the Minister will give us an indication this evening or tomorrow. On three separate occasions he gave this commitment. I was present on one of them, at Johannesburg, at the summit on sustainability. For one moment I felt proud that the Government was going to fulfil a promise but that did not happen.</P>
      <P>There is one small mercy in the Government&rsquo;s amendment, it now recognises that we need an arms trade treaty. I hope it will, at least, fulfil this obligation. Today there was a separate press conference held in another room, at which the cost of the Iraq war, &euro;180 billion, was spelled out. That is a tangible price tag at which we can look and say with certainty that if this money had been transferred to the poorest countries, poverty could indeed be history.</P>
      <P>The arms trade treaty focuses on the supply of arms. Once adopted, it will help to ensure all nations are working to the same standard of arms transfers and ban the export of arms to places where human rights violations are likely. It will be legally binding and based on international law, especially human rights and humanitarian law. It <Col N="475"/>will help to ensure deals rejected by one exporter are not licensed or authorised by another.</P>
      <P>Finland is spearheading the campaign to build international support. It will be necessary for countries to show support for the treaty at the United Nations conference on small arms and light weapons to be held next year. As is evident from the amendment, while Ireland is sympathetic, it has not fully declared yet. I hope the Minister will make his intentions clear this evening.</P>
      <P>The right to sustainable development is enshrined in international human rights instruments and declarations. In addition, exporter governments have made specific commitments under numerous regional and multilateral arms export control regimes to take into account sustainable development and the impact of arms exports on importer countries when undertaking arms licensing.</P>
      <P>These are the most important issues. Comparisons between expenditure in developing countries on health, education and the military are astounding. Seven developing countries, Oman, Syria, Burma, Sudan, Pakistan, Eritrea and Burundi, spend more on the military than on health and education combined. A further 14 developing countries, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Iran, Cambodia, China, Ecuador, Nigeria, Rwanda, Angola, Guinea, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone, spend more on the military than on health or education. These figures place in perspective a problem which Ireland has a role to play in addressing.</P>
      <P>Last year Amnesty International produced a report entitled, Claws of the Celtic Tiger, which showed that the high tech industry here played an increasingly significant role in the defence sector. In 2002 Ireland&rsquo;s military exports were valued at &euro;34 million. Dual use exports, however, which include many components, were valued at &euro;4.5 billion. Irish armoured vehicle technology appears to have been licensed via a Singapore company to Turkey where the military has used armoured vehicles to abuse human rights, including the killing of a man crushed against a wall by a tank during a Kurdish new year celebration in 2002. Also in 2002 the involvement of an Irish registered company with an international arms smuggling operation was revealed. The company, Balcombe Investments Limited, owned the aircraft operated by Renan Airways of Moldova to fly several shipments of illegal arms to Africa.</P>
      <P>The Government commissioned a report on export licensing of military and dual use goods following criticisms from Amnesty International and others. On the basis of this report, published in May 2004, Amnesty International called for legislation to be introduced to govern military exports and control the activities of arms brokers and shippers with a view to improving transparency on documentation related to dual use items.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House what he intends to do about the arms trade treaty? <Col N="476"/>How does he intend to deal with it comprehensively?</P>
      <P>With regard to the millennium development goals and the 0.7% target, if the Minister was to take part in the protest in Edinburgh next week, the responses to the chants, &ldquo;What do we want?&rdquo; and &ldquo;When do we want it?&rdquo; would be &ldquo;0.7% of GDP&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eventually&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are at an historic moment. There is a sense abroad, among people here and throughout the world, that there is a political will and a desire to make poverty history. One can feel we have a chance to achieve this goal. This incredibly strong message was felt in Dublin in recent days and will be stronger still this weekend in London and Edinburgh. In this respect, people look to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to find out what message we have to give them.</P>
      <P>The Green Party motion is an attempt to set out the broad range of issues which must be addressed if we are to make poverty history. This not only involves how much we give but also how much we take and what type of trading systems we have in the world. Our motion is a fair, honest and balanced attempt to set out the right direction we should take. I deeply regret that the Government has chosen to confuse, minimise, remove and obfuscate because it is surely the wrong message for it, on behalf of the people, to send on these issues.</P>
      <P>I will pick up on three issues on which there are differences between the competing motion and the amendment. First, the motion is clear and simple regarding the importance of fair trade in bringing about international social justice. It recognises that we must tackle the conditions that create poverty in the first place and that between 1997 and 2002 the lesser developed countries&rsquo; share of world trade fell. During the same period the value of their food exports decreased by<?oasys _jy?>67%, a disastrous failure of the world trading system.</P>
      <P>The amendment reads like a statement straight from the Washington consensus. Mr. Wolfowitz and his friends could not have written it better as they stand by the rules of the World Trade Organisation. The amendment lacks even an ounce of sense and fails to address whether these rules should be fair as well as free. That is a shame.</P>
      <P>I will take as an example the amended wording the Government has chosen for no clear or beneficial reason in response to our call for a reappraisal of the European Union&rsquo;s current economic partnership agreements which almost every single development NGO across the world has criticised for creating systems that will hinder rather than help the progress of developing countries. The EPAs are more liberal than anything in place in the WTO rules. In this regard, the amendment states: &ldquo; .. .it will be important to have close monitoring and dialogue between the EU Commission and the Council to ensure that the development focus of EPAs remains a <Col N="477"/>primary concern&rdquo;. Although I am utterly pro-European and believe multilateralism is the best approach to achieving solutions around the world, I do not believe dialogue in the European Union should be confined to the Commission and Council, with national parliaments looking on without comment. Sometimes it is appropriate for dialogue to take place between the national parliaments and the European Union. The EPAs offered one such opportunity.</P>
      <P>At a conference in Dublin last week a European Commission official noted that the British had raised concerns about the EPAs, a new neoliberal system, adding that if only one other country was to come out and raise similar concerns, they might be subject to a proper reappraisal. We have seen recently that when two member states ask questions, it changes the way in which the European Union works. The Government had a simple, albeit small, opportunity to raise concerns about EPAs by agreeing with the motion as set out. Had it done so, its position could have been used by the NGOs and others with concerns about this issue to argue in Europe that Britain is not alone in having concerns about EPAs. It would be good to reappraise EPAs, rather than stepping back and indicating that we will examine the dialogue between the Commission and Council. This is a narrow view of the communication which should take place in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The motion includes a call which is neither radical nor likely to rock the foundations of Irish agriculture. Instead, it merely requests a re-examination of the effect of export subsidies on those farmers in developing countries who are worst affected by the European Union&rsquo;s policy of dumping a range of products on world markets. It does not seek a unilateral solution but calls for a multilateral recognition that dumping brings to countries in Africa the very poverty on which the developed nations spend development aid in addressing. The Government amendment removes this call. Is there no room for this issue to be examined? Are we not honest and open enough to admit that this agricultural practice is not the correct approach and damages the countries we are trying to help by other means?</P>
      <P>I was amazed this week to hear how clear, strong and correct the European Agriculture Commissioner was in this regard. She took the simple example of sugar exports. Europe is responsible for approximately 18% of world sugar exports and as a result, a reduction in the price of world sugar by 17% which has serious consequences for the poorest countries. The Commissioner has asked why we do not move towards alternative markets such as bioethanol and biofuels which should be the future of Irish agriculture. It is not as if the approaches advocated by the Green Party would damage world farming. On the contrary, they would open the door to the future.</P>
      <P>As I stated, there is a sense of possibility in the air. In recent days 250,000 people heard from the <Col N="478"/>loudspeakers in Croke Park a strong message which they support and on which they want action. We have a fantastic history. We could go to Africa and say we were not colonisers, that we were like them but the Minister is now taking us in the opposite direction. We are setting up a trading system that will subjugate just as colonial powers did in the past. It will diminish the great tradition and credit we enjoy in the developing world. This must change.</P>
      <P>I commend the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, for calling for a debate. He said politicians needed to hear what the people were saying and he is right. We should have an open, fair and honest debate and would be supported by the people if we had. What we will have instead, however, is fair trade coffee in the canteen of the Department of Foreign Affairs while we do not dare to say anything beyond this on the serious issues on which we can make a point and make real changes on the world stage. We will hang on the amendment the Minister has tabled which provides cover but little else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I accord appreciation to the Green Party for allowing the House the opportunity to debate and formally endorse the Make Poverty History campaign which is unconditionally and enthusiastically supported by my party from the beginning. Sinn F&eacute;in activists are preparing to hit the streets of Dublin where, together with others committed to global social and economic justice, we will gather on Thursday evening at 6.30 p.m. in Parnell Square. I encourage every one who believes in the universality of human rights, that poverty and hunger are human rights violations and that another world is possible to join us and the other demonstrators in an endorsement of this historic objective of the total elimination of poverty and our expression of an alternative vision of global social and economic justice.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly endorse and share the approach that the Green Party has taken in this motion to emphasise the interlinked measures required to achieve our stated objective. With 100% debt cancellation for all heavily indebted poor countries, we need significantly increased, targeted and untied official development aid. We need fair trade rules, trade justice and the European Union to stop standing in the way of this and start acting like a real ally to the Group of 77.</P>
      <P>We need states to stop spending obscene amounts of money on militarisation. Just as Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment to the total eradication of poverty does not stop at our borders, our commitment to the demilitarisation of conflict does not stop with our island but is one of the core objectives of our international relations policy. To truly make poverty history, the world needs a global peace dividend through the diversion of arms spending to spending on human security &mdash; food, shelter, clean water, access to healthcare, education, dignified employment, a living wage and full human rights.</P><Col N="479"/>
      <P>What will the Taoiseach do when he attends the UN summit this autumn, representing the people of this State? Will he once again make aid or other commitments he has no intention of keeping, even though he also claims that our economy is stronger than ever and boasts that Ireland now ranks as the fourth wealthiest state in the world? Will he trot out the standard weak excuses for breaking his promise to allocate 0.7% of GNP to ODA spending by 2007 &mdash; that we are the ninth largest <i>per capita</i> donor of ODA and that we will honour the EU deadline by 2015? Why should we not aspire to be at the very top of the generosity league rather than lagging behind the Nordic states? Why must we be satisfied with reaching only 0.5%, possibly but not definitely by 2007, when other countries now give 1%?</P>
      <P>
        <i>Per capita</i> spending is not relevant to the UN&rsquo;s proposal to contribute a fixed percentage of the nation&rsquo;s wealth. Under the Government, despite our unprecedented Celtic tiger wealth, Ireland has failed and will continue to fail into the foreseeable future to commit just over 0.5% of our income per year to eradicating global poverty. To make matters worse, in the most unscrupulous and duplicitous way the Government and the Taoiseach misled our friends in the developing world to get votes for a seat on the UN Security Council. The Government took advantage of the vulnerability of many of those countries for its own aggrandisement. The word &ldquo;shameful&rdquo; cannot even scratch the surface. The Taoiseach promised the world on behalf of the Irish people. We supported him and felt proud of that commitment, on which the Government does not have the right to renege unilaterally. Sinn F&eacute;in will not give up on it; we will continue to press the Government to keep its promise on behalf of the citizens of the State.</P>
      <P>By now, we are all familiar with the facts and figures: the 600 million children living in absolute poverty and the one child who dies every three seconds from hunger and preventable disease. We can all in our mind&rsquo;s eye see the contrast with the obscene, unspendable wealth amassed and wasted by an elite few. The poorest countries&rsquo; share of world trade has dropped by almost half since 1981 and is now as low as 0.4%. Under the current unjust world trade rules, poor countries must pay back 14 times what they receive in aid. The world, despite agreeing the UN millennium development goal to halve world poverty by 2015, is not following through on its commitments. At the current rate of progress, we will not even halve the number living in absolute poverty until 2147.</P>
      <P>The message with which we need to really come to grips today is a simple one. Nelson Mandela expressed it perfectly when he recently said, &ldquo;Poverty is not natural. It is man made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.&rdquo; I have said it in the past and will repeat myself as often as necessary: all we <Col N="480"/>really need to do to make poverty history is to muster the collective political will. Who could disagree with this?</P>
      <P>We are keeping it simple because our message does not need to be complicated. We do not need to commission more studies because we already know the actions we have to take to make this shared vision a reality. As the leaders of the world&rsquo;s richest countries gather in Scotland for the G8 summit, we and millions like us the world over, in every region and on every continent, demand trade justice, total debt cancellation and more and better aid for the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. As republicans, socialists and internationalists, we are fully committed to making poverty history for everyone on this island and all our brothers and sisters in every nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Green Party for tabling this motion on aid to the Third World. I support it as it is important that this small, independent country plays its part on the international stage in assisting countries that urgently need our assistance. I urge the Government and our country to be a voice for the voiceless and poor. Sitting on the fence is not an option. The Government must immediately meet its commitment to reach 0.7% of GNP devoted to overseas development aid by 2007.</P>
      <P>It is also important to face up to the reality of poverty in our country, despite the economic growth and development in the past ten years. It is not acceptable that 80,000 children still live in poverty. It is not acceptable there are homeless people in our cities or that young couples are priced out of the housing market. It is a disgrace that over 50,000 families are on local authority housing waiting lists. We, a society steeped in wealth, are not delivering to our people. It is not right and there is no excuse that 25% of our citizens are always left behind. It is up to all politicians to ensure all people are treated with respect and equally. The debate is not about resources and wealth but how these are distributed. It is about how we treat our sick, elderly and disabled. I do not want to live in a country where greed and selfishness are rampant.</P>
      <P>I support the international campaign of Make Poverty History. We know from our history about famine, poverty and exploitation. Now it is our turn to lead the charge against injustice and stand by the poorer countries. Let us ensure their children live and get back their dignity. Let us reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s policy of supporting 100% debt cancellation for heavily indebted poor countries, going beyond the inadequate but welcome proposal of the G8 to introduce cancellations to 18 countries. Such debt cancellation must not be accompanied by damaging conditions which erode its benefits. Such cancellation must be funded out of additional moneys and, as argued by non-governmental organisations, the International Monetary Fund gold reserves must be sold to finance debt cancellation.</P><Col N="481"/>
      <P>Developed nations must move away from operating as judge and plaintiff towards heavily indebted poor countries. Debt cancellation is only part of what is needed to assist heavily indebted poor countries. Targeted and united aid must continue to be given and significantly increased. I urge the Government to agree new target dates in view of its acknowledgement that it will not meet its commitment to reach the 0.7% of GNP devoted to overseas development aid by 2007. I call on the Taoiseach to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to this target at the forthcoming UN millennium summit.</P>
      <P>Fair trade is important in bringing about international social justice. I demand the re-examination of subsidies given to producers in the developed world and their effect on those producers in less developed nations. I call on the Government to support the reappraisal of the EU&rsquo;s economic partnership agreements with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, in light of serious concerns that these will inhibit rather than promote their economic development.</P>
      <P>We need to restrict the international trade in arms to assist conflict resolution, to prevent the terrible costs in human life and the attendant economic costs. The Government must support the initiative taken by the Government of Finland to bring about an arms trade treaty through the framework of the UN. Why do governments around the world always have money for arms, yet there is always a problem when finance is required for food, health care and education? I challenge international leaders on this major political and moral issue. It is simply not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Independent Members will always challenge, fight and stand up for working people and the poor in society. That is our agenda and we have no notion of going off course. This motion is about standing with the peoples of other countries in a spirt of co-operation, generosity and equality. I urge all Members to stand with these peoples and support this excellent motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Private Members&rsquo; motion. When the Government, on behalf of the people, committed to leading the way by allocating 0.7% of GNP in development aid, I believed it was a decision of which we should all feel proud. It gave us the credibility to punch above our weight and consolidated Ireland&rsquo;s position as an honest broker. Just as I felt proud of that decision, I was ashamed when it was rolled back on our behalf. Deferring our commitment, in practical terms, means accepting that some lives, mostly those of children, will end prematurely. We cannot account for what other countries do, but we can account for what our country does. Through this climbdown, we are assisting others not to aim for that target.</P>
      <P>Having spent some time trawling through the array of information dealing with debt cancellation, development aid, trade justice, campaign against the arms trade and the provisions of the <Col N="482"/>Kyoto Protocol, one message became apparent, that of equality and the value we place on the lives of the poorest in the world. Over the past year, the increasing intensity of the campaign by Make Poverty History means all Members are familiar with the horrifying figures that demonstrate the true extent of poverty. Some 600 million children live in absolute poverty and 10 million children die of hunger and preventable diseases. That is one child every three seconds. By the time I will have concluded, 100 children will not have survived. Some 852 million people, more than the populations of the US, Canada and the EU combined, will not have enough food to eat. One in six children will die before they reach the age of five years. Unfortunately, these statistics are just a sample.</P>
      <P>The motion seeks a broad response to ending poverty. This is not just about throwing money at the issue. All Members received an e-mail from GOAL, in which some of the matters raised are worrying. Our Government channels approximately &euro;60 million through the Ethiopian and Ugandan Governments. We should immediately cease funding through the Ethiopian Government. I am not saying we should not assist the people in those countries, but we cannot support regimes that murder their citizens, which happened only last week in Ethiopia.</P>
      <P>The Make Poverty History campaign argued for more and better aid. The first assertion is that poverty will not be eradicated without the immediate and major increase in international aid. This is where our obligation starts. The campaign calls for a binding timeframe for the richer countries to reach this target. It demands that aid focus better on the needs of poorer peoples. It must be spent on better health care and education, not tied to goods and services from the donor country.</P>
      <P>There were several good media reports about the results of aid given to some countries affected by the tsunami disaster in December. For these countries to recover, the money must be spent within the region. We can see the sense in this but I do not understand how good practice in one place is not regarded as such in another. The campaign also seeks a more democratic World Bank and IMF so that not only will the concerns of people from poorer countries be addressed, but they will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>The figures of the charity, Concern, highlight that 30,000 people a day die from starvation and poverty related deaths. This is not far short of 1 million people in one month. That figure is etched on our political history as the same number died in the dark days of the Famine. The only way to deal with this global catastrophe is to act collectively. The basis for such action is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed in 1948. One part of the preamble to the declaration states &ldquo;whereas the people of the United Nations have in the charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the <Col N="483"/>equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life&rdquo;. I ask that we live up to that by committing to the 0.7% target of GNP.</P>

        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>welcomes the very substantial increases in Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, which has grown from &euro;96 million in 1994 to &euro;545 million in 2005, which is channelled to some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and which has made Ireland the world&rsquo;s ninth largest aid donor on a <i>per capita </i>basis;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>welcomes the fact that the Government has already committed to expenditure of &euro;1.8 billion on Official Development Assistance over the years 2005-2007;</P>

      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>notes that the Government is strongly committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% for expenditure on ODA and it will take a decision on this in <Col N="484"/>advance of the UN Millennium Summit in September 2005;</P>

      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>recognising the increasing convergence between issues of environmental degradation and world poverty, and in view of the fact that the adverse impacts of climate change are, and will be, disproportionately borne by the world&rsquo;s poorest people, supports the Government, in the upcoming negotiations on global action to tackle climate change after 2012, in seeking a fair, equitable and inclusive agreement that will reduce the vulnerability of developing countries through reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases and through assisting developing countries to access the resources and expertise required to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share time with Deputies Nolan and O&rsquo;Connor. I am glad of this opportunity to speak and I thank the Green Party Members, despite their comments. I am somewhat disappointed by their attitude to the amendment which the Government and I thought was better-worded and which does not detract from the Green Party&rsquo;s motion&rsquo;s sentiments. I regret that it appears the House might divide on this issue because it is not an issue on which it should.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the debate provides us with an opportunity. I thank the Green Party for providing the opportunity to have a debate which will embrace the totality of the development agenda, not simply the question of overseas development <Col N="485"/>aid. It offers the House an opportunity to deal with the key issues of aid, trade, the international arms trade and the environment. Each of these topics would merit an extensive debate on its own, never mind combining them in one debate. However, I will attempt to address each of them as comprehensively as possible in the time at my disposal.</P>
      <P>I will start with aid. In terms of cash disbursements, Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme has grown enormously over the last decade. It is worth remembering that none of the G8 donor countries provides the same level of aid <i>per capita</i> as Ireland. On average they provide 0.21% of their GNP in aid, just over half the level of aid achieved by Ireland. Since the formation of this Government, the aid programme has risen by &euro;387 million, from &euro;158 million in 1997 to &euro;545 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money today. In 1997 we spent approximately &euro;39 for every man, woman and child on our development programme. This year we will spend about &euro;136, an increase of almost &euro;100. Everyone will accept that these are significant amounts. Moreover, they are in addition to the personal donations made by many Irish citizens to the developing word.</P>
      <P>In addition, we now have a three-year commitment, which stipulates an increase of &euro;60 million this year. To put that figure in context, the T&aacute;naiste received &euro;70 million to deal with the accident and emergency service issue. It will be increased by &euro;65 million in each of the next two years. In fact, over the three years from 2005 to 2007, the Irish taxpayer will pay &euro;1.8 billion in overseas development aid. Hence, this multi-annual commitment provides an excellent opportunity for careful planning and implementation.</P>
      <P>I do not say this to detract from the UN target of 0.7% in any way, but to show just how much the Irish people currently give to the developing world. On the issue of the UN target, I am the first to assert that we must meet this target. In my work as a UN special envoy, I promote the UN reform package, part of which is a greater commitment to the development agenda and particularly to the 0.7% target. I wish to reassure the House that this Government is strongly committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% for expenditure on ODA. We need a sustainable, tenable and deliverable target. We will not be rushed because this is serious business. I refer to the Government&rsquo;s amendment, which clearly states that it is committed to achieving the UN target of 0.7% and that it will make a decision on the subject in advance of the UN Millennium Summit in September.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware that the European Union recently agreed &mdash; again as part of my exhortations as UN special envoy &mdash; to set a new set of targets regarding ODA. Those member states which have not yet reached a level of 0.51% of GNP on ODA should individually reach that level by 2010. They have also undertaken to achieve the UN target of 0.7% by 2015. Indeed, when that decision was made, Kofi Annan stated <Col N="486"/>that it would put wind into the sails of the proposals in his reform package, particularly in the development area. Other member states which joined after 2002 have lower targets. The EU 15, in other words excluding the ten newer member states, have also committed to a new collective target of 0.56% by 2010. This means that by 2010, the EU as a whole will disburse an additional &euro;20 billion in aid to the poorest countries in the world. That is a major step forward and I am sure it will be welcomed by everyone who is concerned for the developing world. Naturally, Ireland fully subscribes to these new targets agreed by the European Union.</P>
      <P>Cash disbursements do not give the whole picture regarding aid as where and how the funding is spent is also important. In this respect, Ireland has an excellent record. Our aid programme has been highly praised for its value and focus on the poorest of the poor. The last peer review of the OECD in 2003 noted that our aid programme distinguishes itself by its sharp focus on poverty reduction and its commitment to partnership principles. The recent report by Action Aid International entitled Real Aid: An Agenda for Making Aid Work, found that Ireland has one of the highest quality overseas aid programmes among western donors. The report distinguished between &ldquo;real aid&rdquo;, that is assistance which reaches its target and brings genuine improvements, and &ldquo;phantom aid&rdquo;, which ties recipients to purchases from donor countries, or is poorly implemented. We must state with pride that irrespective of what political party was in Government, we have never tied our aid. There should be a greater focus on many of the larger countries in respect of this issue. That report put Ireland at the top of the list, noting that almost 90% of Irish aid is &ldquo;real aid&rdquo; which benefits poor people in developing countries and that our aid is totally 100% untied. This means we do not link our aid to the purchase of Irish goods and services, as unfortunately do some other countries. Consequently, goods and services provided represent best value and often help to build up local service providers.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, the G8 called on the OECD to set ambitious and credible targets for the indicators of aid effectiveness agreed in Paris earlier this year. It is particularly important to set targets for untying aid, so that more of it can be spent by and in developing countries, thus multiplying its developmental impact.</P>
      <P>Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is focused on some of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries. We are one of only six countries which spends more than 0.15% of GNP on the least developed countries. To cite the recent Action Aid report again, Ireland spends more of its aid, 79%, on low-income countries than any other country, apart from Portugal.</P>
      <P>As far as debt is concerned, the provision of aid, though vital, is only one of several dynamics in the relationship between the developed and the developing world. Two other vital factors are debt relief and trade. The recent announcement <Col N="487"/>by the G8 finance ministers that they will finance 100% cancellation of World Bank, African Development Bank and International Monetary Fund debt owed by a group of the world&rsquo;s poorest countries represents significant progress.</P>
      <P>For the first time, the most powerful countries in the world, those that effectively control decision-making at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have accepted that many countries should have their loans with these institutions completely written off. This agreement represents significant progress towards solving the thus far intractable problem of Third World debt. Ireland has argued for many years for such a move. Our official policy on debt which was adopted in 2002 by this Government, called for 100% debt cancellation for all heavily indebted countries. The Government felt then and continues to feel that a country&rsquo;s requirement to repay debt must not prevent it from maintaining an adequate level of expenditure on services and investments in health, education, agriculture, water supply, sanitation, roads and other infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Without adequate resources for these areas, development and poverty reduction are impossible. I am very glad the G8 countries have come to the same conclusion. For Ireland, the success of a debt relief or debt cancellation scheme is principally measured by how much it increases the money available to the beneficiary government for spending on poverty reduction. It seems clear from the conclusions of the G8 Finance Ministers&rsquo; meeting that financing of the debt cancellation will be additional to the current resources of the international financial institutions. This means that in overall terms resource flows from international financial institutions to developing countries should be unaffected by debt cancellation and the relief provided should result in additional resources being available for recipient countries.</P>
      <P>However, it is also possible that the allocations of funds to the individual beneficiary countries from the international financial institutions will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the debt relief resulting from the cancellation. Perhaps that is the point to which Deputy Higgins refers. Countries may not, therefore, have direct access to additional resources for expenditure as a result of the cancellation. Rather, they will have to compete with other low income countries for access to the benefits of the debt cancellation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if the cancellation is financed from existing bilateral aid flows, it could well mean that the debt relief is accompanied by an equivalent fall-off in bilateral aid flows. It is vital that this does not happen. It is important that Opposition parties publicly support our stance on this important issue.</P>
      <P>The opportunities for the beneficiary countries to achieve the millennium development goals will only be enhanced if, at the same time as their debts are cancelled, the aid they receive, includ<Col N="488"/>ing the funds allocated to them by the lending institutions, are maintained or increased. Ireland and other non-G8 donors will be expected to participate in the financing of the debt cancellation. For Ireland, which is not a lender and has always provided its aid as grants, every euro we put into debt relief should turn into an extra euro for the country receiving the relief.</P>
      <P>I hope that in the process of bringing their donor partners on board, the G8 countries will be prepared to show the flexibility around the objectives and principles which govern the implementation of the initiative that will allow us all to finance it with enthusiasm and hope for its success.</P>
      <P>Some proposals for debt relief in the past have turned out to be less generous than originally they appeared. I hope this will not be the case with the latest proposals. Developing countries deserve a fair deal on debt. It must be remembered however that debt relief or cancellation, even implemented in the most favourable manner possible, is unlikely on its own to solve the economic problems of poor developing countries. The G8 agreement is historic and represents significant progress but it is only a part of what is required to make real progress in eradicating extreme poverty.</P>
      <P>The yearly value of the debts being cancelled will be approximately US$700 million. Even if all this relief turned into new money in developing country budgets, it would still be less than one fiftieth of the increase in annual aid budgets which the World Bank estimates is needed to achieve the internationally agreed millennium development goals. The volume of assistance to poor developing countries needs to be increased significantly. As I have already mentioned, Ireland&rsquo;s aid budget has grown significantly and will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Trade is a powerful engine for economic growth which can lead to sustainable development and ultimately to poverty reduction. Ireland firmly believes that having a transparent, rules-based global trading system is the best way to help developing countries to integrate into the global trading system. The Government is committed to working towards a successful outcome to the Doha development agenda negotiations and the sixth ministerial conference of the WTO in December 2005.</P>
      <P>The most fundamental objective of the WTO Doha development agenda launched in November 2001 is to further the integration of developing countries into the global trading system. However, many developing countries have understandable concerns that a multilateral trading system will have severe negative effects on their economies. The Government believes that the Doha negotiations need to result in real benefits for these countries if their concerns are to be successfully addressed. The Government is working to ensure that the Doha development round will be a genuine development round. Central to our approach and that of our EU partners <Col N="489"/>is a commitment to respond positively to the concerns of developing countries.</P>
      <P>As we approach the sixth ministerial conference in Hong Kong next December, we will maintain our commitment to this balance. Preparatory work for the conference is proceeding, notwithstanding the difficulty of some of the problems that need to be resolved. I am confident that the Hong Kong conference will provide the necessary impetus to progress in the final negotiations of the Doha development agenda and that the successful conclusion of the round is now in prospect. Ireland&rsquo;s priority in these negotiations has been, and will continue to be, that the process of trade liberalisation continues in a fair and balanced way and that the WTO continues to provide a stable and consistent framework for the regulation of world trade.</P>
      <P>The Government does not believe that trade liberalisation alone, including agricultural trade liberalisation, is a panacea for development challenges, particularly in the case of least developed countries. The integration of least developed countries into the global economy will require not only trade liberalisation measures, it will require measures to fight HIV-AIDS; build trade capacity; attract foreign direct investment; promote agricultural and rural development; support the role of women in agricultural production; and, crucially, increase investment in new technologies.</P>
      <P>The EU has a number of preferential trade relationships with least developed countries. The biggest is the so-called Cotonou Agreement with 77 countries mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, but also the smaller Caribbean and Pacific states. This provides access to EU markets on preferential terms for exports from these countries. The latest phase of the Cotonou Agreement has just been concluded by the EU and the ACP states.</P>
      <P>Another important trade link is the 2001 everything but arms initiative which grants least developed countries very wide access to EU markets. The economic partnership agreements, EPAs, which are due to enter into force by 1 January 2008, are an integral element of the Cotonou Agreement. The EPAs are intended first and foremost as instruments for development to foster the smooth and gradual integration of African, Caribbean and Pacific states into the world economy. They combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states. This overall approach is welcomed by Ireland and other member states concerned that development and poverty reduction should be the principal objectives of the EPAs. We are, therefore, clearly not talking in the case of EPAs about conventional trade agreements.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome recent statements by the EU Trade Commissioner, Peter Mandelson, that he intends to strengthen the development focus of EPAs. He has announced his intention to <Col N="490"/>establish, with his fellow Commissioners, including the Commissioner responsible for development, Louis Michel, and in partnership with the ACP countries, a dedicated structure to keep the EPA process under close review. This is important not least because the Commission, as the institution competent for EU trade policy, is the body which negotiates on behalf of member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland is actively following developments in the EPA negotiations. As they move into a critical phase, Ireland, in common with other EU member states, will continue to ensure that there is close monitoring and dialogue between the Commission and the Council to ensure that the development focus of EPAs remains to the fore.</P>
      <P>This Private Members&rsquo; motion raises the very important issue of international trade in arms. I agree with the sentiments expressed and in my amendment to the motion I have proposed only some slight amendments to the original wording. The best and most effective way to control such trade is through international agreements and, therefore, I have added a reference to this effect in the text of the first indent on this issue. I have also replaced the word &ldquo;restrict&rdquo; with &ldquo;control&rdquo; as the latter is more commonly used and understood internationally in the context of export controls.</P>
      <P>My amended wording also deletes the reference to Finland in the second indent, which deals with the proposed arms trade treaty. The treaty was devised and has been promoted by a number of non-governmental organisations, including Amnesty International and Oxfam. My understanding is that the Government of Finland, while being very supportive of the treaty, is not the co-ordinator of the campaign for the treaty. The campaign for the treaty has also been supported by other countries. It is for those reasons I believe that rather than singling out a particular country, a more general reference would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>On the fundamental issue of the international trade in arms, Ireland recognises the importance of addressing this issue. There are all too many examples of conflicts which are fuelled by proliferation of conventional weapons, especially in developing countries. It has been estimated that approximately 300,000 people are killed each year in violent conflict and war. Global stockpiles of small arms and light weapons amount to an estimated 600 million units. This is especially an issue of concern in Africa where the proliferation of these weapons continues to have a serious negative impact on fragile economies and brings terror, misery and suffering to societies throughout that continent.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the principle of having legally binding international agreements on the control of arms exports with as wide a participation as possible. Ireland is committed to working with others to ensure that the international community deals effectively with the illicit trafficking of such weapons. Currently, all exports of arms from EU countries must conform to the EU <Col N="491"/>code of conduct on arms exports which establishes criteria to control such exports. Ireland was actively involved in the establishment of this politically binding code, which was adopted by the EU Feneral Affairs Council in June 1998. The code lists the factors to be taken into account when deciding whether to allow an export of military goods, including respect for human rights, the internal situation in the country of final destination and the preservation of regional peace, security and stability. Discussions are ongoing in the EU on the possible reinforcement of the status of the code of conduct.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ireland has actively participated in negotiations in the United Nations on an international instrument to regulate the marking and tracing of illicit small arms and light weapons, which I am pleased to note was agreed upon earlier this month in New York. This will assist the international community in its efforts to control such trade in a much more systematic way. A welcome aspect of the international trade treaty proposed by NGOs is that it has the objective of setting out states&rsquo; existing international legal obligations in the area of international transfers of arms. Once ratified, the proposed treaty would enable the international community to move forward incrementally, by means of subsequent specific instruments, to strengthen international controls on arms transfers. Ireland has taken an active interest in this initiative. During Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU last year, we placed this issue on the agenda of the relevant working group in Brussels.</P>
      <P>The Government fully shares the view that climate change is the most serious threat to the global environment and that poor people in poor countries are most vulnerable to its adverse effects. Such people are least able to cope with extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and droughts which are expected to occur with increased frequency and intensity due to the impact of climate change. The second Kyoto Protocol commitment period negotiations will be very sensitive.</P>
      <P>The Government believes that comprehensive dialogue is essential and must involve the United States, the oil producing countries and developing countries that, up to now, have had no obligation to curb emissions. Together with our EU partners at the United Nations framework convention on climate change meeting held in Buenos Aires last December, Ireland pressed hard for the initiation of these negotiations. Parties to the conference agreed to hold a seminar in Bonn, which took place in a very constructive atmosphere. Negotiations on the next phase should ideally conclude by 2008.</P>
      <P>The Government believes the targets set should be ambitious and that responsibility for curbing emissions should be fairly shared. We will work to that end in the months to come and at the first meeting of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol, <Col N="492"/>which is scheduled to take place in Montreal in November 2005. Under the United Nations framework convention on climate change, a special least developed countries fund was established to help those countries plan for and cope with the adverse effects of climate change. Ireland was one of the first to contribute to the LDC fund and I intend making further contributions in this and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>Again, I pay tribute to the Green Party for highlighting the issues under discussion tonight. I am disappointed the party could not accept what I believe is a better motion. Ireland has led the way over the years and we should pay tribute to our own Bono and Bob Geldof and to the representatives of our NGOs, who have been slaving away on this issue for many years. I do not think people realise the amount of effort and the level of funding the Government spends on their behalf, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It is important that we air these issues so that people are fully aware that over the next three years, we will spend &euro;1.8 billion of their money on overseas development, especially in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan"><NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Minister in commending the Green Party for putting down this motion. I am disappointed that we could not reach consensus and that the House will divide on the motion tomorrow night. All parties in the House have a genuine commitment and concern. It has been a tradition in this country to assist developing countries, especially those in the Third World.</P>
      <P>The EU has been able to agree an interim overseas development assistance target as part of the EU contribution. That is to be welcomed, given the challenges faced by the new member states in meeting this target. I was disappointed to note that it will take us a little longer to meet the targets set down by the UN, I still welcome the fact that we have agreed to progress towards that. I hope it will happen sooner rather than later.</P>
      <P>There are three aspects to this debate: debt relief, aid and trade. I welcomed the news that the G8 finance ministers have agreed to a 100% debt cancellation of World Bank and African Development Bank debt. This will go some way towards alleviating the problems of developing countries. Nonetheless, we have been very forthcoming in our aid and perhaps it has not been targeted in the right areas in recent years. One area in which we can be pro-active is trade. We must continue that because we in Ireland have seen, as a developing country, that if we use trade and the economy to its full effect, we can be far more helpful to our citizens, to the country and to the planet.</P>
      <P>One aspect of all this is local to me, but is topical at the moment and highlights many of the difficulties we will encounter. If the sugar reform package being proposed by the European Commission is accepted in its present form it will not only destroy the sugar industry in Ireland, it will <Col N="493"/>also have a dreadful knock-on effect on some of the APC countries.</P>

	<P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Nolan, on his courtesy and I thank the Minister for his speech. I am always happy to praise his work on this issue. I have a particular interest in this subject and thank the Green Party for tabling the motion. I visited Zambia in 1995 and recently, I had the opportunity to visit Lesotho and South Africa. Several weeks ago, I went to Ethiopia for the elections with Senator Fergal Browne. We were very impressed by what we saw and at the same time we were very troubled by much of what we saw. The election was held on 15 May and I found out today that the results will not be declared until 8 July.</P>
      <P>I feel very privileged to be given the opportunity to speak on this motion in the week when the announcement by the G8 states will come to fruition. Bono and Bob Geldof have been referred to and we should praise the work they are doing. My friend and political mentor, Chris Flood, was the Irish envoy to the tsunami disaster and was also the chairman of the Minister&rsquo;s advisory body. I also mention my colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and commend his work in this area.</P>

      <P>The people of Africa are not just looking for a hand out, they want an opportunity to do something positive for themselves. As a nation, it is not too long ago that we had our own experience of famine. In our present prosperity, it is important that it remains in our memory so that we can empathise with the desperate plight in which some of these people find themselves. It is very important to continue at this level to make the case for aid for Africa. Like others of my generation, I brought a penny to school every single day for Africa though I was not sure in those days exactly what I was doing. From my little experience, especially in Ethiopia recently, it seems nothing has really changed. I commend the work of Irish aid organisations which, as I have seen on the ground, do a tremendous job.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Fine Gael reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">In the tenth paragraph, to delete &ldquo;demands re-examination of subsidies given to producers in the developed world and the effect of such subsidies on their counterparts in less developed nations;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Tonight&rsquo;s motion is timely as many hundreds of thousands will gather in a few days for the Live 8 concerts in London, Edinburgh, Washington, Berlin, Paris and Rome. They will unite in a common cause to demand debt cancellation for the poorest countries and increased aid and trade with the developing world. In short, they will demand action from all governments working together. While the demand coincides with the upcoming G8 summit, the call goes out to all. It is time for countries like Ireland to realise their international obligations and begin to meet them.</P>
      <P>We must tackle the endemic poverty, disease, illness and starvation which form the bedrock of lives which are often cut tragically short. Every day which passes sees poverty and disease thrive in many parts of a world in which 1.2 billion people live on less than a dollar a day, 28,000 children die from poverty-related causes, 8,000 people die of AIDS and 14,000 women and girls die from pregnancy and childbirth-related complications. In 2002, 2 million people died of TB. Among the ways we can help to alleviate poverty and disease is through our commitment to overseas development aid.</P><Col N="495"/>
      <P>When Ireland made the historic commitment to increase aid to UN target levels by 2007, its announcement was justifiably welcomed throughout the world. The sense of disappointment and anger which accompanied the Government&rsquo;s disgraceful U-turn has been well documented. It was a dark day for the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition and for Ireland as a whole. Recently, the original 15 EU member states agreed to increase aid to 0.51% of GNP by 2010 and to at least 0.7% of GNP by 2015. In fact, four member states have already met the 0.7% target while six others have promised to meet it on a date before 2015.</P>
      <P>Where is Ireland&rsquo;s new commitment to aid? Having abandoned the 2007 deadline, have we also delayed the implementation of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s solemn promise to the UN by at least eight years? The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid described the EU agreement as historic recently. He went on to say it was positive that the European Union had taken a lead on this important issue which begs the question of whether the Government has a memory problem. Ireland took the lead on the issue in 2000 but without apparent embarrassment we are happy to abandon the role and pass responsibility to the European Union. Even if the Government tries to forget that its actions are unacceptable, the people will not.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about our aid commitments, we should be prepared to back them up with legislation. Last December, I outlined when Fine Gael tabled a motion on overseas development aid why an aid target should be set out in legislation to ensure that every future Government would meet its commitments. To set aside a fixed percentage of GNP for a specific purpose is not a new concept. The most recent example is the national pensions reserve fund, under the legislation for which a set amount of 1% of GNP is automatically diverted from the Exchequer annually. The process does not demand annual D&aacute;il approval as the amounts are specified in legislation. Legislation to provide for the allocation of 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid from the Exchequer each year would copperfasten Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to meeting its international responsibilities. The legislation should be introduced now as we cannot wait until 2015 to meet the UN aid target.</P>
      <P>If we allow aid to increase according to current spending plans, it will be 2028 before Ireland meets the target. In the absence of a concerted effort to meet aid targets, the millennium development goals will not be reached. In his report, In Larger Freedom, the UN Secretary General emphasises our obligation to ensure the millennium development goals are achieved in the context of the deaths every year of 3 million from HIV-AIDS while countless more are lost to disease, poverty and starvation. Mr. Kofi Annan has stated clearly that while the goals can be reached by 2015, it will only happen if all involved <Col N="496"/>accelerate action on aid dramatically. In contrast, Ireland has dramatically decelerated action on aid, which is a cause of great concern.</P>
      <P>Debt cancellation is an integral aspect of the relief required by the countries of the developing world. The recent G8 proposal to cancel the debt of 18 states has been welcomed. We should not underestimate the importance of the proposal which writes off $40 billion and saves each country approximately $1.5 billion in annual repayments. We must also, however, reaffirm support for the policy of 100% debt cancellation for heavily indebted poor countries which Ireland proposed some time ago.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a role to play in the promotion of good governance and the tackling of corruption in the developing world. Every person who donates money to the developing world from a pocket or pay packet wants to know it does the best possible work for those who need it. We should take every reasonable and possible action in co-operation with developing world governments to ensure the best, most co-ordinated and most effective use of aid is achieved.</P>
      <P>Action on an international arms treaty is also vital as many around the world continue to live with the results of the indiscriminate use of landmines. We must ensure through action and co-operation with other countries that arms are traded according to the most stringent rules and regulations which take account of the value of human life. Progress should be made on the drafting of the important arms trade treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Private Members&rsquo; motion moved by the Green Party. Tabled in the context of the upcoming meeting of the leaders of the G8 countries in Edinburgh and the World Trade Organisation ministerial conference in December, the motion affords Members the opportunity to re-examine the Government&rsquo;s policies in the context of the goal of making poverty history. While Fine Gael supports the Green Party Members in principle in bringing forward the motion, as my time is limited I will concentrate on just a few points.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael concurs with the policy of 100% debt cancellation for heavily-indebted poor countries. While the write off by G8 countries announced on 10 June for 18 of the poorest states in Africa is a step in the right direction, Fine Gael would like to see the policy broadened to include the 42 most heavily-indebted countries in the world. A write off would provide them with more money in their budgets to achieve the millennium development goals by spending more on the vital services in health, education, agriculture and infrastructure which are crucial to their long-term futures.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about making poverty history, we must do more than pay lip service to an ideal. The Government must immediately agree a new target date to achieve 0.7% of GNP on overseas development aid. The Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="497"/>Conor Lenihan, informed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently that a timeframe and mechanism to meet the UN target was under ongoing review. It is imperative that the ongoing review reaches a conclusion quickly. I call on the Government to stop procrastinating on the issue and honour its commitment by immediately setting out a realistic timeframe to reach the 0.7% target.</P>
      <P>The Green Party motion demands a re-examination of the supports given to producers in the developed world and their effect on producers&rsquo; counterparts in less developed regions. I will first consider the effect of subsidies on the developed world using Ireland as an example. Since reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992 and the Agenda 2000 agreement, the emphasis of EU agricultural supports under the CAP has moved away from the traditional market supports to direct payments to farmers. In 2003 direct payments received as a percentage of farm income amounted to 68%. Last year the payments accounted for 74% of aggregate farm income. It is clear that for agriculture to survive such support measures are needed.</P>
      <P>We must support our indigenous agricultural industry. The agrifood sector as a whole accounts for 9% of GDP and employment and 8% of exports. More than 112,000 people are employed in primary agriculture and nearly half that number again in the food and drinks industry. Agrifood exports last year were worth &euro;7 billion to the economy, but when taken as a net value based on balance of payments etc., they are worth &euro;11 billion so they are a significant element of our economy.</P>
      <P>In many rural areas where farming is on the decline, this decline does not stop at the farm gate. It has a significant domino effect. If we are serious about preserving our rural landscape, we must encourage people to remain on the land and maintain farmers in rural areas. It must be pointed out that as a result of EU payments, Irish farmers are now encouraged to farm in an environmentally sensitive way, which has had a significant impact on the rural landscape.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that for 80% of European farm holdings the amount of direct support farmers receive is less than &euro;5,000 but it is crucial to ensuring that small farmers in rural Ireland can continue to live and work the land.</P>
      <P>For those who have not been following the recent reforms, the single farm payment is now completely decoupled from food production. We no longer have a system of agriculture that encourages inefficient farming. The focus is now on quality, efficiency and environmental practices. The revised Common Agricultural Policy which was agreed in 2002 by all member states was to provide funding for agriculture between then and 2013. The budget was to start at 38% of the total EU budget and scale back over the period to 30% by 2013. That deal was signed by each member state and we must abide by it.</P><Col N="498"/>
      <P>The jury remains out as to whether removing all subsidies will help poor countries. A cut in EU sugar prices could have a negative impact on less developed African countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>

	<P>We will convert them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference in the recent EU sugar reform proposals to the design of an assistance package for less developed countries is an acknowledgement of this fact. Tr&oacute;caire has called for the maintenance of quotas for less developed African countries. It recognises that there must be room for domestic production of sugar in Europe. The change to subsidies can have a direct negative impact on many of these developing countries. We could see the major sugar barons in the likes of Thailand, Brazil and Australia, many of whom reside within the European Union, benefiting from it.</P>
      <P>Food security is an important issue. The reason we have subsidies and supports in the European Union is to ensure we have food security for European consumers. A key question is how much we value the need to have a domestic food supply that provides safe, quality food. We must answer that question in regard to the debate on the CAP. Do we want factory farms, hypermarkets and dodgy imports, which is contrary to what we have at present? In those circumstances the countryside would become a desolate place as the agricultural economy is the lifeblood of many towns and villages the length and breadth of Ireland. I commend the amended motion to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. While welcoming the recently announced debt cancellation, we must ensure that as part of the First World we would give leadership on this issue. We have given leadership in the past but, unfortunately, our name has taken a knock in recent times. I ask the Minister to reiterate the objective of reaching 0.7% of GNP in overseas development aid.</P>
      <?oasys _dc14-?>
      <P>A total of 1.2 billion people live on less than $1 a day. Earlier this year I visited Ghana where I saw people in those circumstances. I met some missionaries there who after 50 years do not understand how these people survive on less than $1 a day. They were wholehearted in their tributes to them for their initiative and survival instinct in such appalling conditions. Statistics show that every day 800 million people go to bed hungry and 28,000 children die from poverty related causes. It is appalling that rich countries do not respond to the needs of the Third World. We must send a clear message that there is a moral obligation not alone in this country but in the developed world in general to ensure that basic human dignity is maintained in the Third World.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that 14,000 women die each day from causes related to childbirth, 99% of them in the developing world. Some 15 million children around the world have lost one or both parents to AIDS. I visited an AIDS centre when I was in Ghana and saw at first hand the devastation caused by children being orphaned because of AIDS and children who were born with AIDS because one or both of their parents had it.

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this matter.

I welcome the publicity towards this end generated by people like Bob Geldof, but I want no more excuses or half promises from the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, or the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Ireland has had a proud record through its church workers and individuals down through the centuries. Even at a time when we could not afford it, our people supported those who were worse off and were in desperation.</P>
      <P>The name of Ireland has been damaged by the fact that, while the Taoiseach gave a solemn commitment on the world stage to get his man elected, in the end he failed to deliver the 0.7% of GNP he promised to devote to overseas development aid. Six months ago the people showed their total and absolute commitment to the people of south-east Asia when they fundraised and gave personal donations, shaming the Government into committing sizeable sums in aid. The way it was given, one would almost think the Minister was losing out and not the compliant taxpayer. I call on the Taoiseach to reaffirm Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the 0.7% target when he <Col N="500"/>attends the forthcoming UN Millennium Summit. When he returns from that summit he must put in place mechanisms to deliver on the commitment within two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
      <P el="10">Seanad amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">  Section 5: In page 8, subsection (1), lines 36 to 39, &ldquo;an officer of which is the accounting officer in relation to the appropriation accounts of that body for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts 1866 to 1998&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;which is not the subject of an allocation by a Minister under <i>subsection (2)</i>&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P FLI="0">
        <b>Ms Lynch: </b>Amendment No. 1 concerns section 5. This section was probably discussed on Committee Stage more than any other section. Difficulties arose regarding how various elements of the structure were to work but, nevertheless, <Col N="501"/>section 5 is probably the most fundamental section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 5 makes reference to services and states a &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means &ldquo;a Minister of the Government&rdquo;. This Bill affects several Departments and therefore it is a question of &ldquo;Ministers of the Government&rdquo;. Given the importance of ring-fencing, what is meant by &ldquo;services&rdquo;? Do the services to be provided by each Department comprise only services specific to people with disabilities or all services? If, for instance, the OPW were to install a ramp to facilitate access to a building, would it be part of the service? Would it be what the funding is for? Is the tactile pavement the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provides through local government services part of the service? Does it pertain to the budget?</P>
      <P>Is the education service provided by the Department of Education and Science part of the service? Is this what its budget is for? I do not refer solely to the education service for children with disabilities because the Supreme Court decision on primary education for people over 18 extends the scope in this regard. Exactly what services are we talking about? To what does ring-fencing apply? If the education service is part of the service referred to, how does this square with the constitutional obligation regarding primary education?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state exactly what he means by &ldquo;services&rdquo;? Are they disability-specific services? Does he mean services including those which are available to us all? I would like a comprehensive answer to these questions because it is very important that we know exactly the budget that will be available to each Department. Will it be a question of the comprehensive service including services for people with disabilities or simply a question of disability-specific services? If it is the latter, how will the budget of each Department be determined at the start of each year?</P>

	<P>We are dealing only with the first and second of 33 Seanad amendments although the time allowed for considering them will elapse in 25 minutes. As I stated today on the Order of Business, these 33 amendments are broadly technical and do absolutely nothing to rescue this fundamentally flawed legislation. Since the Seanad did not make a series of amendments taking on board the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the recommendations contained in the document Equal Citizens, or amendments that transformed the Bill significantly into rights-based legislation, the exercise in the House is absolutely fatuous.</P>
      <P>I strongly disagree with even the notion of section 5, which imposes resource limitations. This is its primary purpose. This is not the stuff of legislation that would make a key and critical difference in the delivery of the rights of people with disability. We want to see legislation <Col N="502"/>presented that all the people of Ireland deserve. I emphasise this because it does not only concern people with disabilities but all the citizens of this State. We all have a right to see the desired legislation presented. None of us is at a remove from this issue. Only for the grace of God, we might well be at the centre of what is actually needed in this legislation. Who knows what the future will bring for any of us?</P>
      <P>This legislation is for all the people of Ireland and these amendments do absolutely nothing to change what is, in effect, a Bill that has turned its back on the recommendations of the Government-established Disability Legislation Consultation Group and all its good work. This is exemplified by the withdrawal of many of those who had made an heroic and critical contribution and who ultimately found themselves, very disappointingly, having to campaign against the end result of all their labours because the Government turned its back on it.</P>
      <P>Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2 confer no rights and establish no commitment to the principle of progressive realisation. Every provision in section 5 is framed to reduce the State&rsquo;s liability for failure to provide essential services. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment, which was presented by my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh during the substantive debate on the legislation in this House, sought to ring-fence funding for disability-specific services. Of course this was rejected by the Government.</P>
      <P>Although not wishing to labour my point on Seanad amendments Nos. 1 and 2 because we may wish to proceed further, I must state that any amendment to section 5 that does not introduce the principle of ring-fencing funding for disability-specific services is not relevant, serves no useful purpose and is an example of the futility of the entire exercise in which we are engaged this evening.</P>
      <P>I regret greatly that we will not have another opportunity to pass judgment on the substantive Bill. Instead, we must vote on whatever Seanad amendments are outstanding at 9 p.m. It is the only mechanism open to us with which to show our absolute contempt for a Bill which shows contempt for those who hoped, worked for and deserved legislation which reflected their rights and needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments are largely technical. I am not 100% sure what amendment No. 1 is supposed to achieve. Perhaps the Minister of State would explain. Judging from what he said in the Seanad this is a purely technical amendment and relates to section 2 not contradicting a part of section 1 when changed.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 2, the Minister of State is replacing the word &ldquo;required&rdquo; with &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;. It would be useful to know why that is being done. Perhaps the DLCG had something to do with it. However, it appears to weaken the legislation in that if funding is required it is up to the <Col N="503"/>Minister of the day to judge whether it is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The Bill would make sense if it included a provision in this section whereby funding was earmarked early in the year and then ringfenced so that it could not be used for anything other than the services needed for people with disabilities. However, this is not the case, as the Minister of State made clear to me on Report Stage. Is it possible at this point for the Government to put that kind of structure in place? A judgment could then be made at the start of the year regarding the amount of money required to provide services for people with disabilities for that year. That money would then be made available and could not be touched by anybody except for those services. If the money ran out during the year, a supplementary budget could be introduced to top it up.</P>
      <P>This section, however, goes the other way. There will be very little left for the services provided for in this Bill if a flu epidemic occurs and the HSE must use the funding. This huge cornerstone should be in place but it is not. The entire strategy is built on sand; it is a quicksand into which people can sink. This is the Bill&rsquo;s major flaw.</P>
      <P>We are discussing largely technical amendments and the changing of words. There are a number of amendments further along which some of us suggested on Committee and Report Stages and which the Minister has now taken on board. I would be interested in what he has to say about section 5, one of the key funding sections. It is specifically set up to protect the Minister, the Exchequer and the Departments so that nobody can say that the Department must spend a certain amount of money to help a child badly in need of a service. Until now the courts could do this and parents have had to go to court to get support and services for their children. However, that will not be possible under this section. It will preclude people from going to court and the courts will be unable to make a judgment to provide a service. That is what people are saying about this section.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has said many times that he does not want the courts to tell him, the Government or the HSE what to do. Heretofore citizens had no choice but to go to court to get rights for their children and for other adults. Hopefully the situation will change but unless the funding is sufficient and ringfenced, it will all be built on sand. I hope it works for the sake of the people who deserve and need services and supports from the State in order to achieve a quality of life that gives them dignity and respect. That is what we all wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendment does nothing to address serious concerns regarding the need for a rights-based Bill. There was an emotive response to the Minister of State&rsquo;s approach at a meeting last night in Limerick. Families of those with disabilities expressed their extreme concern and near anger at the failure of the <Col N="504"/>Government to respond to the advice which was given by those put in place to do so. Mr. Justice Flood was very clear in that the only approach was on the basis of introducing a rights-based Bill. Others who contributed were singular in the view that nothing less than a rights-based Bill was acceptable and that it is needed to ensure that people with disabilities get their rights under various international conventions, including the Convention on Human Rights. Section 5 and the amendments before us do nothing to allow for this discussion and we are concerned in that regard. Politicians from many parties gave a commitment to ensure that, should the opportunity arise, a rights-based Bill would be introduced to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment and makes it clear that the definition of specified bodies relates to bodies such as the HSE and the courts which operate with their own financial Votes and where the relevant Minister does not allocate funding.</P>
      <P>The change reflected in amendment No. 2 was sought by the DLCG at its recent meeting with the Taoiseach on 25 May. The Taoiseach indicated that the matter would be reviewed and the Government has since agreed to make the related change to the Bill. Page 9, subsection (4), line 6, states that in determining the appropriate allocation under subsections (2) and (3), the Minister or specified body shall ensure that the amount remaining after the allocation is not less than the amount that is required. The word &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; is more balanced in the context of the balance achieved in this Bill. The DLCG felt that the word &ldquo;required&rdquo; was somewhat too strong and we accepted the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Lynch&rsquo;s point, services are described in section 2 of the Bill and do not include education services which are provided for in the new special education Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the points made in terms of rights, I am absolutely satisfied that the provisions in this Bill give a considerable number of rights to people with disabilities but do not include a new right, namely, the right to a justiciable decision. I took on this responsibility following publication of the Bill and am satisfied that it would not be in the best interests of people with disabilities to have justiciable rights. A situation already exists in respect of health services whereby justiciable rights do not exist. They have existed in the past with regard to special education services. It is quite clear from decisions taken and the ensuing results that most of the money received in terms of justiciable rights in the courts with regard to the issue of education has gone into lawyers&rsquo; pockets.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in what I read in this morning&rsquo;s paper. I would particularly like members of the Labour Party and Fine Gael to confirm whether they will give a commitment to <Col N="505"/>introduce legislation giving justiciable rights. It is not in the interests of people with disabilities. It is no wonder someone like Mr. Justice Flood wants to have justiciable rights. He would probably feel it is the courts that should decide the level of service to be provided for people. It is not the courts that should do this, but this House.</P>
      <P>The legislation is innovative in that it provides for transparency for the first time, in that each Minister must outline in public at the beginning of the year the amount of money that he or she will allocate for disabilities. With the multi-annual funding of the next five years there will be no change in that departmental allocation. It is not possible to include in legislation the ring-fencing of money in any area of public expenditure. I had robust discussions with officials in the Department of Finance who were quite clear that in the interests of good governance and the proper use of public funds, we could not ring-fence funding in legislation. I assure the House, however, that the Bill provides that each Minister must outline the allocation of money he or she will devote to disabilities during the year. It would take a brave Minister to change that allocation and with multi-annual funding, there will be no need to change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of information, Deputy Lynch is incorrect. That is plainly incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if that is a point of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no such thing as a point of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of information. It is just a point of pomposity and an indication that the Minister of State thinks he is right about everything. It is not a point of information.</P>
      <P>With this Disability Bill we have a Minister of State who clearly does not have the power, the will or the desire to change anything or to put something in place that would benefit people with disabilities. That was very obvious from the outset of this process. I do not know if Deputy Fahey felt this was a form of punishment for him but he clearly did not have the interest required to do the job properly.</P>
      <P>Those who campaign on behalf of people with disabilities have enough to do without running to the courts at every turn. Yet the Minister of State has consistently said, every time he has risen to his feet, that their only aim in life is to put money <Col N="506"/>into the pockets of barristers and solicitors. Mr. Justice Fergus Flood did not speak last night as a judge, he spoke as the chairman of the Commission on People with Disabilities. To even infer that it was in his self-interest that he proposed the inclusion of justiciable rights requires an apology from Deputy Fahey. It is outrageous that he should make such an assertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>People who have to go to court to vindicate their rights do so because they have no other option. I ask the Minister how he thinks we would react to legislation that stated that either he or I could not go to court to vindicate our rights, whether in relation to wrongful arrest, slander or a civil action of some kind. We would strongly protest and we would be right to do so.</P>
      <P>People with disabilities are not lesser citizens. They are equal citizens who just happen to need more help from the State than people who are able-bodied. The difficulty is that this Government perceives them to be lesser citizens and is not prepared to do the right thing. I point out to the Minister of State that everything costs money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>If this Bill is all the Minister of State claims, why is he afraid of the courts? If this legislation will provide the necessary services and supports there is no need to insert a provision that prevents people from going to court. The last place people with disabilities or their parents want to go is to court. The court is the last resort, the final choice and people only go there because the State has let them down. In most instances they are vindicated in the neutral venue of the court, although the Minister of State seemed to imply that our courts are not neutral. Under the Constitution the courts are there to uphold the rights of individuals and if the courts find in favour of the citizen, they are doing their job. If this Bill is all that it is claimed to be, if it will provide the services and supports Deputy Fahey claims, there is no need to prevent people from going to court if they feel they must. People should not have to go to court, if this Bill is so good.</P>
      <P>Through the Finance Act, money is ring-fenced every year and there is no reason that could not be done in the context of the Disability Bill. I do not know if the Minister of State has ever read the Finance Act. It is a large document and there is considerable reading in it, as well as much work. Money could be set aside and ring-fenced specifically for the services for which the Bill legislates. If funding is inadequate, a supplementary budget could be introduced to ensure that people receive the services they require. That is what should be done, but this Bill and the section under discussion, is specifically designed to protect the State and Ministers from the weakest sector of our society, namely, people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>At the outset of the debate on this legislation, I read out a letter from the parent of a disabled <Col N="507"/>child. He said that when he read this Bill, it was like a slap in the face. He wondered why the State is so afraid of his child, who cannot walk or talk. Why is the State so afraid that it must insert safeguards into legislation to protect the State and the Exchequer from his child? That is what that parent wondered and that is exactly what is happening with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I said I hoped the Bill would work, for the sake of people with disabilities. We will follow the progress carefully from the autumn, when the D&aacute;il returns from its imposed exile. We will track the progress of the Bill, ask questions and examine how every section of the legislation is put into place. We already find that the special needs area in education is being cut back. Special needs assessment officers are telling children in schools that they cannot have a special needs assistant. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill does not appear to be working in that regard.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that there is sufficient funding in place, that it is ring-fenced and not frittered away on other services in the health or education areas and that the services and supports are in place for the people who need them. The need is great. Deputies who were in Limerick last night heard people describe their experiences, the pressures they are under and their anger and frustration was palpable. One&rsquo;s heart would go out to such people when one realises what they have to endure and the fears they have for their disabled children when they die and so on.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will work, but I have major reservations. We will track progress and follow every <Col N="508"/>stage of its enactment and implementation. Unfortunately, because of the guillotine we will not be afforded the opportunity to discuss other amendments tabled. However, most of these are technical and will not make a huge difference to the substance of the Bill.</P>

	<P>As this is almost the last minute allowed for this discussion, I wish to briefly state that the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s critique of section 5, as passed by the D&aacute;il will still hold, even if amendments Nos. 1 and 2 were accepted. The critique deals with the proposed system of funding which provides Ministers and service providers wide discretion to deviate from the provision of services identified as being required, or appropriate, by persons with disabilities. The Human Rights Commission concluded that this Bill does not guarantee the progressive realisation of rights and therefore is not consistent with our obligations under international human rights law. In all the responses from the Minister of State in the course of the entire debate on the so-called Disability Bill, I never noted that he addressed the concerns raised by the Human Rights Commission and I do not know if time will allow for that this evening. This is a most unsatisfactory process.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 16, line 6, to delete &ldquo;who is not eligible to be so registered, but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that an adequate number of vets will be appointed. Having regard to the number of sub-committees that may exist, it is important to ensure adequate veterinary representation is available to each of them. We discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage. It is important that account is taken of this amendment to ensure the number of vets required is available to fulfil their role adequately on such various committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to speak to the three amendments in my name and that of Deputy Crawford. Amendment No. 2 questions the reason a veterinarian cannot represent animal welfare groups. I accept the point made by the Minister on Committee Stage that she wants to maintain a balance on the Veterinary Council. She wants to make sure that there are not too many vets on the council. However, I do not understand why the chairperson of the ISPCA &mdash; to use the example I gave in this regard on Committee Stage &mdash; who traditionally was the person normally appointed to represent animal welfare groups, should be disbarred from representing that organisation on the Veterinary Council sim<Col N="511"/>ply because that person holds a veterinary qualification. That is not satisfactory. I do not believe that there will be too many vets. The legislation should not be prescriptive in that way. I will not go into this amendment in further detail because we articulated this point well on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>We also discussed amendments Nos. 4 and 15 on Committee Stage and the Minister gave a commitment that she would examine the position in this regard. I raise these amendments because for some unknown reason the legislation has been worded as if there is only one institution in the State that provides veterinary qualifications, but that is not the case. The National University of Ireland provides the majority of qualifications here, but HETAC also provides qualifications, and account is not taken of that in the legislation. Members of the Athlone Institute of Technology are extremely annoyed it was not consulted under any guise on this legislation. A significant amount of the legislation directly relates to the institute and it was never consulted. No recognition, whatsoever, has been given to the Athlone institute in the legislation, yet one other institution is implicitly written in, namely, UCD or the National University of Ireland. As I said on Committee Stage, either the NUI should be taken out of the equation or HETAC should be included, for the sake of balance. The legislation has a provision whereby as a default mechanism the NUI nominates members to the Veterinary Council of Ireland. Even at this late stage will the Minister of State consider inserting an amendment, in consultation at least with HETAC, so that at least it has a consultative role as regards this? These are the only two awarding bodies in the country and I cannot see the logic of precluding one of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, in her response on Committee Stage, said nothing precludes her, as the Minister, from specifying any particular institute of technology, and that is correct. Yet, why does she have to include one body and ignore the other? There are only two relevant institutions in the State and I cannot understand why one of them has to be precluded from the legislation. I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider that argument. HETAC is an awarding body and there is absolutely no mention of it. The representatives on the ground in Athlone Institute of Technology are very aggrieved that they were not consulted as regards this legislation. They feel they deserved to have an input, just like everyone else. What really annoyed them is that implicit in the legislation is one institution while the other is ignored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies will no doubt be aware that there was considerable discussion about the composition of the council during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and on Committee Stage in this House. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, already agreed to adjust the composition of the council to ensure that sufficient veterinary expertise was available, particularly to serve on sub-committees. In order to achieve this, she agreed to an increase of two in the elected veterinary practitioner membership. As regards the amendments being put forward again by Deputies Naughten, Crawford and Upton, the issues concerned were given considerable airing on Committee Stage in this House. As the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, indicated previously, the underlying concerns are already catered for in the Bill as currently formulated.</P>
      <P>As regards the welfare constituency which is the subject of two amendments, already there is a critical mass of veterinarians on the council, all of who will, by virtue of their profession, be very mindful of welfare. However, there is also an issue of overall balance involved and I cannot agree to further increase the representation of vets on the council.</P>
      <P>As regards consultation with HETAC, the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that this would be examined further. Following this examination we do not believe any change is necessary since the matter of nominating rights beyond the NUI is already catered for in section 16(2) of the Bill. Deputy Naughten instanced a course being run for veterinary nurses in Athlone Institute of Technology, which I understand is in its first year. It would be premature at this stage to include a specific reference to HETAC in the Bill before the course has been accepted by the veterinary council in its role under section 13 as an approver of courses for the purpose of registration. However, if and when this approval is granted, it is likely the Minister will, at that stage, designate HETAC as a nominating body, using her powers under section 16(2) of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputies Naughten and Crawford, by means of amendment No. 15, also proposed that it be stipulated in section 16(2) that a member of HETAC must be appointed to the council&rsquo;s education committee. Again, I feel this is premature. However, if in due course a nominee of HETAC is appointed to the council, section 16(2) already provides that the person must be on the education committee. As regards Deputy Upton&rsquo;s proposal to specify that the dean of the veterinary faculty must be on the council, as the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has already indicated on Committee Stage, we do not believe it would be appropriate in primary legislation to prescribe <Col N="513"/>whom a nominating body must nominate. This must be left to the nominating body itself.</P>
      <P>As regards the nominee of the Minister for Education and Science, the Government remains of the view that it would not be appropriate to remove this person. Matters relating to training and education, including continuing professional development, are among the most important functions being assigned to the council. In so far as the education sphere is concerned a nominee of the Minister and nominees from the education providers are essential and appropriate. We therefore do not accept the amendments for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards amendment No. 5, a very important point was being made in relation to the dean of the faculty of veterinary medicine at UCD. As I have pointed out, it is the only school of veterinary medicine on the island. By tradition the dean holds a very specific role of responsibility within the faculty. It would be appropriate that as the representative of that body of professional veterinarians, and the educators, particularly, the dean of the faculty should be given a position on the council. Traditionally, this role has been held by the faculty of veterinary medicine.</P>
      <P>I also take account of what Deputy Naughten said regarding HETAC. While I am promoting the dean of the faculty of veterinary medicine, UCD &mdash; I regard this as very important &mdash; I accept the role of HETAC, the other awarding body for the veterinary profession, namely veterinary nurses. Some account should be taken, in particular, of that role as well. I accept this is its first year and that awards have not yet been conferred. Nevertheless, HETAC clearly will be the awarding body and it is very important it is recognised in that role and has parity, at least, with the faculty of veterinary medicine for which I am arguing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I come back to the issue of HETAC and the significant concerns among veterinary nurses. I do not know the ins and outs of their qualifications or their training. However, staff at the Athlone Institute of Technology are adamant that the core structure that has been approved under HETAC is to a considerably higher standard than what is taking place in the National University of Ireland. I do not know whether that is the case. It would take someone more expert than I am to decide whether that is the position. Perhaps Deputy Upton is in a better position to adjudicate on that. However, be that as it may they feel their qualification could be watered down. The rules governing that and the registration could be watered down because the function of the veterinary council is to set the rules as regards the practice of veterinary nursing. That is one of the council&rsquo;s first functions and roles. HETAC has put the structures in place and indicated specifically what hurdles have to be crossed by students attending Athlone Institute <Col N="514"/>of Technology to get their qualification. All of a sudden the sands are shifting under that structure.</P>
      <P>Those particular students signed up for that course on the basis of meeting specific targets when they would emerge with a specified qualification. There is genuine concern in this regard. There is also concern at Athlone institute level that if the NUI is the only representative as regards the education element of the veterinary council, and that the university in conjunction with the council will set the rules for the future as regards the registration, functions and roles of veterinary nurses, then it will not have a role in that.</P>
      <P>Finally, on the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is likely to include HETAC under section 16(2), will he be somewhat more specific and indicate whether she will do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Upton&rsquo;s point about the dean of the faculty, it is generally expected that he or she will be appointed. The Minister&rsquo;s point is that the House should not tell the nominating body who it must appoint, although it is generally expected that the dean will be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure one or two individuals from Wexford will also be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so. While it is good that a new and, I am sure, worthwhile course is being offered at the Athlone Institute of Technology, the Minister is not in a position to approve it. The Veterinary Council of Ireland is the only organisation which can approve a course. However, the Minister has indicated that if and when approval is granted, it is likely that she will designate HETAC as a nominating body using her powers under section 16(2). She stated same on Committee Stage. I anticipate that as soon as the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the only body with power to approve a course, approves the course in Athlone, the Minister will be in a position to consider HETAC as a nominating body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 37, line 12, after &ldquo;disease&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;which poses a significant threat to animal or human health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This brings us back to the issue of the definition of the term &ldquo;a significant threat to animal or human health&rdquo;. There is considerable concern that the current wording could give the Minister a blank cheque in terms of the diseases she would designate. Vets are also concerned that the Minister could include in the designation routine procedures carried out as part of an animal health programme.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister, the sole purpose of the provision is to deal with significant diseases, for example, class A diseases, but the powers given to the Minister far exceed this specific element. In the Seanad and in committee, she consistently stated that the sole purpose of the provision in both the relevant sections is specifically to deal with serious emergencies arising from class A type diseases or a shortage of veterinarians which requires us to bring in vets from abroad. She consistently cited the example of foot and mouth disease as the reason for introducing the provision. No one, inside or outside the Chamber, would have a difficulty with the provision, provided that this is its sole purpose. The difficulty, however, is that as the legislation stands, any disease can come under this category. The purpose of the amendment is to provide clarity in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister argued on Committee Stage that she did not want to be restricted if an urgent and significant threat to animal or human health emerged and, therefore, the class A definition might not be appropriate. I accept her argument, which is the reason I tabled these amendments specifically to deal with the types of diseases that would pose a significant threat to animal or human health. They provide a sufficiently broad definition to facilitate the Minister in terms of any potential necessity to apply the provisions, as set out, while also protecting the integrity of the veterinary medicine profession. Given the considerable concern regarding the broad definition in the section, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider and accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="516"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the thrust of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s argument. The issue of limited registration has been widely debated and the Minister offered some useful recommendations and advice on the matter. Nevertheless, the veterinary profession is concerned as to what exactly might be implied by the provision for limited registration. For this reason, it is important to specify that the provision would be activated only where a disease poses &ldquo;a significant threat to human or animal health&rdquo;. Failure to do so would open the door to interpretation and thereby create an environment in which limited registration could be made available in circumstances that were never intended. The inclusion of the specific wording, &ldquo;a significant threat to animal or human health&rdquo;, would remove ambiguity from the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to amendments Nos. 6 and 7, the subject of limited registration has been debated extensively during earlier Stages of passage of the Bill. Although the Minister has explained in depth the rationale for the section, it may be useful to briefly cover it again since there appears to be an underlying concern that the provision could be used as a back door to register unqualified persons in a manner which would undermine the veterinary profession. That is not in any way the intention behind the provision.</P>
      <P>The 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease, though limited geographically, nonetheless showed the extreme pressure a larger outbreak would place on the veterinary service, both State and private. It must be taken into account that a disease episode could be EU-wide or even hemisphere-wide, meaning that we could not call on practitioners from elsewhere in Europe. In these circumstances, it is no more than prudent to make statutory provision for an exceptional recognition mechanism, which would allow persons with requisite skills, for example, trainee vets from a third country, to be taken in expeditiously to carry out specified tasks determined by the Veterinary Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Provision is also made under the section to recognise persons who, while eminently qualified in a particular field which would render desirable their presence in, for example, a veterinary college for teaching purposes, would nonetheless not hold a conventional veterinary degree.</P>
      <P>The section also contains important safeguards. The Veterinary Council of Ireland must satisfy itself that it is appropriate to activate the provision. The education committee has been designated under section 63 a function to advise the council on the skills and knowledge required. The grounds for limited registration are specified in section 45(2), and section 45(4) provides a basis for attaching conditions, including time, geographic limits and operating under supervision, to a limited registration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific amendments under consideration and bearing in mind what I have said, it would not be appropriate to limit the pro<Col N="517"/>vision to significant diseases. In any event, the formula contained in section 45(1) gives the council, rather than the Minister, an adequate framework within which to decide when it is appropriate to activate this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response. While I accept his point that the provision contains checks and balances and the Veterinary Council of Ireland ultimately calls the shots in terms of activating the provision, I am at a loss to understand why the amendment is not deemed appropriate. During every Stage in both Houses, Members were told <i>ad nauseam</i> that the provision would apply in the event of an outbreak of a disease such as foot and mouth disease, which poses a significant threat to animal or human health. Any such outbreak may not necessarily involve a class A disease, the definition of which may change at some future date thus requiring amendment. This amendment is well balanced and makes provision for what the Minister wants. I cannot understand why she is not prepared to consider it when it copperfastens everything she said on all Stages.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point about a veterinary teacher. There could be a need for microbiologists if there is another major outbreak of foot and mouth disease. The fair and balanced proposal in the amendment addresses the provision the Minister requires while providing the protection for concerns that have been articulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>With emerging diseases such as avian flu and familiar diseases like foot and mouth disease, the intention of the Bill is to categorise class A diseases. To include the words &ldquo;a significant threat to animal or human health&rdquo;, however, would take any contingency into account. It would clarify the situation while protecting veterinary practitioners in the area of limited registration. There are economic and human and animal health connotations so it is important we specify what we are talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the debate in the Seanad, when this issue arose, and on Committee Stage, the Minister has considered the suggestions made by Opposition Deputies. She believes it would be inappropriate to limit the provision of class A disease since a class B or uncategorised disease could pose as great a threat. In terms of the significant threat format, this is more of a policy statement than a legal provision.</P>
      <P>There are questions as to who will decide when a significant threat exists and the criteria that will be used to decide it. The Minister feels the existing draft, which reserves the power to activate limited registration to the council, implies the council must assess the situation in light of the conditions prevailing and reach a decision as to whether the other possibility of getting veterinary expertise into the country at short notice is not adequate. The Minister has given considerable thought to the amendments put forward but she <Col N="518"/>still feels the situation is the best way forward and that the VCI would go through the exhaustive conditions before any decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The argument does not hold up. The Minister of State made the point about class A and class B diseases. I accepted that and changed the amendment between Committee and Report Stages to redefine the issue. The amendment provides checks and balances and I do not see any difficulty with our wording. It gives rise to concern that it is not acceptable.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 41, line 25, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment comes back to the issue of definitions. There are such wide provisions in this legislation that the Minister could regulate everything bar the kitchen sink if she wished. In the definition of veterinary practice, there are such broad provisions that every Member of the Oireachtas could be defined as a practitioner of veterinary medicine if the majority of the House wanted without any debate. That is the main difficulty I have with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the profession would be protected if there was a provision requiring the positive approval of the D&aacute;il and referral to a committee. Many Ministers are sympathetic to this sort of provision but for some reason the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not prepared to consider it in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Section 53 provides for the Minister to introduce regulations on live animal certification or products of animal origin. The Minister, when Deputy Crawford raised the issue on Committee Stage, said it was not the case but section 53(1) covers what veterinary practitioners can certify. The veterinary profession has a certain degree of influence in the Department of Agriculture of Food and we must ensure checks and balances are in place.</P>
      <P>We have teased out the transportation of animals with the Minister on a number of occasions so there is a sensible and practical approach taken that is not stacked in favour of one profession getting its cut of the cake before everyone else. <Col N="519"/>That is why I am concerned about the practice of veterinary medicine. The amendment would mean the Minister would have to bring regulations before the House, thus ensuring any proposals to extend the provisions for veterinary medicine would be debated. Otherwise, it is possible that a Minister could be caught in a bind with the veterinary profession when the issue of certification by vets who want a slice of the cake before allowing these procedures to go through arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. I sat in this House when we agreed regulations with the then Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and former Deputy Dukes was our spokesperson. Categorical assurances were given that the issues would be brought back to the Chamber within 12 months. Recently, on a debate on the special powers Act, I noted that, on an annual basis, the Oireachtas has an opportunity to discuss its measures. If there are problems with the legislation, we have the right to change it. The regulations in this legislation could have major implications for the future of farming. We must protect the good name of our agricultural produce. However, we cannot protect it at all costs and there is justification for this amendment. These measures must be brought back to the House if and when necessary and not just on a Minister&rsquo;s whim. I urge the Minister of State to realise it is not in the interest of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to have all matters tied down to regulations.

	<P>There are two important elements to this amendment. Precedents already exist in other legislation allowing for this type of amendment to be put in place. It is not as if an unusual provision is being sought. The second element concerns the power given to the Minister. It is true that when dealing with any modification, particularly with regulations, the Minister has the exclusive power to bring in that regulation. This is neither good for the Minister nor the House. Regarding regulations introduced in the past, it is important the opportunity exists to have a full debate on them. It would serve to protect the Minister because of the potential far-reaching consequences of any regulation that may be introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage during which the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, pointed out there is separate legislation in place governing certification by veterinary practitioners, this issue was discussed at some length. This legislation is the European Community (Certification of Animals and Animal Products) Regulation 1999, SI 380/99. Accordingly, the conferring of functions in the certification is not appropriate for this legislation. The purpose of the reference to certification in <Col N="520"/>this Bill is simply to bring it within the legal definition of the practise of veterinary medicines when it is designated to vets. However, the designation of such functions will not be provided for under this legislation and, therefore, the need for the amendment does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has no problem with a debate in the House a year after the Bill is enacted. However, it would have to be agreed by the Whips at the time. This is the standard practice in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>He is well on his way.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to other secondary legislation. It defies logic that the protection regarding secondary legislation provided for in section 53 is other secondary legislation that can be rubber-stamped through the House. The Minister of State referred to the European Communities (Certification of Animals and Animal Products) Regulation 1999, SI 380/99. In effect, secondary legislation will protect other secondary legislation. That is a pointless argument. It is obvious he has not listened to our argument that checks and balances need to be put in place for the Minister, as much as anyone else.</P>
      <P>While he argues that this is the wrong legislation on which to discuss this issue, the amendment states in black and white what vets can certify and it provides that the Minister, through secondary legislation, will make that provision regarding the certification. I do not want a situation in the future where a partnership member, the veterinary practitioners, has an ace card up its sleeve to put pressure on the Minister to act in a particular way. This could also have large ramifications regarding costs that could be introduced under emergency measures. The Minister could argue that due to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, we have no other choice but to introduce these emergency measures.</P>
      <P>We know the difficulties some provisions introduced under the definition of emergency measures cause on a day-to-day basis and that they subsequently cause hardship for many. However, these have not been reviewed as there is no provision to debate them on the floor of the House, as Deputy Crawford pointed out. The Minister of State must examine this issue again if he thinks that, just because there is other secondary legislation that goes through on a nod and a wink, we should drop this amendment.</P>

	<P>It will be returned to the Seanad this week. All Ministers are accountable to the House through, for example, parliamentary questions, Private Members&rsquo; time and Standing Order 31. There are many ways in which a Minister is accountable to the House. I will point out Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. She has given consideration to the issues raised on Committee Stage. However, she believes this is the wrong legislation for this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food has seriously considered amendments Deputies Crawford, Upton and I have tabled. That is why she has tabled so many amendments on Report Stage, all of which are of a technical nature. That reply does not wash.</P>
      <P>This is secondary legislation. The Oireachtas is criticised in the courts and the tribunals of inquiry because it does not scrutinise legislation properly. Whatever criticism we can take on primary legislation, we all accept that secondary legislation basically provides the Minister of the day with a blank cheque to do whatever he or she wishes. We all know that under procedures, it is difficult to tease out issues in secondary legislation. If the Minister signs a regulation next Friday, it will not be discussed in the House until October, with no checks and balances provided. Large measures can be implemented at a particular time. I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment, particularly in returning to the Seanad on this amendment. It is important that proper checks and balances are in place to protect a Minister and officials as much as everyone else.</P>

	<P>We do not have a later opportunity to discuss legislation passed in this House. I attempted on umpteen occasions to raise matters concerning regulations on foot and mouth disease in the House.

However, this co-operation was not appreciated or given fair play afterwards by the Government.</P>

Deputy Naughten stated that the Minister for Agriculture and Food was not listening, but I note that since the Bill was first introduced to the Seanad and its subsequent passage through the D&aacute;il, approximately 104 amendments were taken on board. Some were tabled by the Minister and others by the Opposition.</P>

	<P>Hence, the Minister listened and, in particular, she took into account a number of amendments tabled by Deputies Upton and Naughten. As I stated, major changes have been <Col N="522"/>effected, with 104 amendments since the Bill was first introduced in the Seanad.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the need for clarification by the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, in the context of his replies to Questions Nos. 180 of 17 May, 221 and 222 of 24 May and 247 and 248 of 31 May, of his approval or otherwise of the decision of Dublin Port Company to make a site available without going through the normal tendering process to facilitate a private consortium bidding for the national conference centre contract.</P>
        <P>I raise questions and I demand clarification from the Minister of State, arising out of a secret arrangement entered into by Dublin Port Company to provide a site for a private consortium, the Anna Livia Consortium, on which this private consortium has bid for the contract to build the national conference centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is the sole shareholder on behalf of the people for Dublin Port Company. The Anna Livia Consortium is a private consortium comprising Bennett Construction Limited, Kilsaran Concrete Limited and Earlsfort Developments.</P>
        <P>This secret deal was arranged without a competitive tendering process and thus fails to comply with public procurement law and policy. Neither does it comply with the code of practice for the governance of State companies. After I raised the issue in the D&aacute;il by way of a parliamentary question, the Minister of State confirmed that his Department had received a letter from Dublin Port Company requesting retrospective approval for its proposals to enter into the arrangement with the consortium in question.</P>
        <P>The Minister also confirmed that the proposal of Dublin Port Company provides that in the event of the consortium being successful in its bid for the development of the national conference centre and appropriate planning and other consents being issued in respect of same, Dublin Port Company will make a site available to facilitate the development of the national conference centre together with further and complementary commercial development.</P>
        <P>The arrangement entered into by Dublin Port Company, DPC, has been done without a competitive tendering process. No competition has been held by DPC nor have the principles of Irish and EU public procurement law and policy been adhered to.</P>
        <P>DPC is a &ldquo;contracting entity&rdquo; within the meaning of article 2 of the EU utilities directive and, <Col N="523"/>as such, it is subject to the public procurement law regime set out in the utilities directive. Furthermore, as a State-owned body, DPC is subject to Government guidelines, the most recent being the national public procurement guidelines of 2004 which update the 1994 green book. The guidelines enshrine the principle that competitive tendering should always be used by any public body in awarding a contract unless exceptional circumstances apply.</P>
        <P>In response to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 221 and 222 of 31 May, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, indicated that the Department is concerned to ensure that DPC has complied with &ldquo;applicable legislation and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies&rdquo;. The code of practice has specific guidelines on the disposal of assets. Section 5.1 provides that where any property with an anticipated value at or above &euro;70,000 is disposed of, it should be by way of auction or competitive tendering process, except in exceptional circumstances, such as a sale to a charitable body. The method used should be both transparent and likely to achieve a fair market-related price.</P>
        <P>In the context of the national conference centre, we are talking of significant sums of money. The ballpark figure for the national conference centre will be in the order of &euro;300 million. Ancillary and complementary developments, depending on the extent, could easily add another &euro;300 million or more to the overall development project. Clearly in the context of such enormous sums of money, there are huge dangers and temptations, which in the context of more modest amounts, have led to the establishment of tribunals.</P>
        <P>At a minimum it is essential that any involvement by a State-owned company should be in full compliance with public procurement law and policy. At this stage, it is essential for the Minister of State to clarify the position fully. He should furnish details of the alleged non-binding heads of agreement entered into with the private consortium, including date, terms and full details of the lands involved.</P>
        <P>I am talking about land values with full zoning and planning permission, which could be in the order of &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million an acre. Approximately four acres are needed for the national conference centre. The Minister indicated that the arrangement with the private consortium also provided for further or complementary commercial developments. Depending on the extent of such complementary commercial development another four acres could be involved.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the lands being made available by Dublin Port Company may have a value of more than &euro;200 million. If the bid of the Anna Livia Consortium for the national conference centre is successful, that private group will end up as the only possible purchaser, thus avoiding the com<Col N="524"/>petitive tendering process. Inquiries and offers for these lands by a number of other parties have been rejected by Dublin Port Company. Therefore, the arrangement between Dublin Port Company and the Anna Livia Consortium has all the hallmarks of a sweetheart deal, possibly of the Galway races tent variety, since the principals on both sides are well known Fianna F&aacute;il supporters.</P>
        <P>The D&aacute;il and the public are entitled to an explanation for the fact that Dublin Port Company has dealt exclusively with one private consortium in respect of this matter and has failed to give an opportunity to others to tender or to be considered for any such arrangement. The D&aacute;il and the public are also entitled to know why Dublin Port Company sought ministerial approval for the arrangement only after the heads of agreement had been completed and the matter had been raised in the D&aacute;il by me.</P>
        <P>At this stage, the D&aacute;il and the public are also entitled to full clarification from the Minister as to whether he approves of the activities of Dublin Port Company on this issue. Failure to provide full clarification will certainly fuel speculation as to the real reason for this secret deal and as to how the parties involved hoped to justify such an extraordinary arrangement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe for providing me with this opportunity to report to the House on the background and current position regarding the matter of Dublin Port Company and the Anna Livia Consortium which is one of the candidates for the provision of a national conference centre. The Office of Public Works has provided my Department with an information note on some key events in the procurement process for the national conference centre and it is appropriate to refer to some of these key events by way of background.</P>
        <P>In June 2003, the Government agreed in principle to the provision of a national conference centre. To facilitate and oversee the process, the Government authorised the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to set up a steering group to include the Chairman of the Office of Public Works and senior representatives of the Department of Finance and F&aacute;ilte Ireland. The group was to be chaired by the Secretary General at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and was to be supported, as necessary, by professional expertise, including the National Development Finance Agency.</P>
        <P>In November 2003, the steering group approved the placing of advertisements by the Office of Public Works seeking expressions of interest for the provision of a conference centre on a design, build, finance, operate and maintain basis. Responses to the advertisements were received from four candidates in January 2004. Subsequently, tenders from two of these candidates, including the Anna Livia Consortium, were <Col N="525"/>received by the Office of Public Works and are currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>On 22 March 2005, the Department received a press query by e-mail regarding the use of land in the ownership of Dublin Port Company in connection with a proposal for the national conference centre. On 23 March, the Department requested Dublin Port Company to provide it with relevant information regarding the proposal. On 1 April, Dublin Port Company replied to the Department stating that it was facilitating a consortium in a tendering process for the national conference centre. On 1 April, the Department requested the company to provide a note setting out the involvement of the company in and implications for the company of the consortium&rsquo;s proposal and a clear statement of what was meant by the company facilitating the consortium.</P>
        <P>On 7 April, the company replied, stating that it has been facilitating one of the consortia bidding for the national conference centre in so far as it has consented to the inclusion of a site in the ownership of the company in the submission of the consortium to the Office of Public Works as being potentially a suitable site for the national conference centre. The company stated that it had entered into non-binding heads of agreement with the consortium, that it had not concluded a formal contract with the consortium and that it had not concluded an agreement for the disposal of company assets or to provide access to those assets in favour of any third party.</P>
        <P>The principal issue at stake from the point of view of the Department is compliance by the company with the applicable legislation and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. The primary responsibility for compliance rests with the company. In this regard, the company has confirmed to the Department that it is adhering to the code of practice. In my reply to Question No. 180 on 17 May, I stated that, based on the information provided to the Department, I had no reason at that time to request further information from the company regarding this matter.</P>
        <P>On 18 May, the Department received a letter from Dublin Port Company requesting ministerial approval for its proposal to enter into an arrangement with a consortium as detailed in draft heads of terms attached to the letter. The company states that, in essence, the proposal provides that, in the event that the consortium is successful in its bid for the development of the national conference centre and appropriate planning and other consents issue in respect of the national conference centre, Dublin Port Company will make available a site to facilitate the development of the national conference centre, together with further and complementary commercial development.</P>
        <P>The Department has had a number of consultations with the Department of Finance regarding the application of the code of practice and the legislative provisions relevant to the particular case presented to it by Dublin Port Company. In <Col N="526"/>this context, the two Departments have agreed that it is necessary to seek the advice of the Attorney General on the matter, in particular regarding the process applicable to the proposal by Dublin Port Company to make available to the Anna Livia Consortium a site to facilitate the development of the national conference centre together with further and complementary commercial development. I assure the Deputy there is no question of a sweetheart deal. He can be assured this will be dealt with in an open and transparent manner.</P>

      <sTitle>National Aquatic Centre.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the water slides in the national aquatic centre is called the dark hole. I reckon the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, wishes he could climb into that dark hole and hide while somebody competent sorts out the mess in the &euro;62 million centre.</P>
        <P>This week&rsquo;s revelation that the national aquatic centre is losing 5 million litres of water a month have really proven to be the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back. Can the Minister substantiate reports that substantial cracking is visible on both floors of the centre&rsquo;s underground plant room and that more than 20 large cracks have appeared? Can he substantiate reports that design flaws make it difficult to maintain the pool&rsquo;s plant equipment? Is it true that the centrepiece of the national aquatic centre, the 50m competition pool, is open for a mere four hours in the morning from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.?</P>
        <P>The Minister boasted to me previously that the national aquatic centre was completed within the time schedule set for it and within the budget of &euro;70 million. Would he make the same argument if a builder built his home ahead of schedule and within budget only for the house to fall apart within two years? Somehow I doubt it. Will the Minister publish a detailed analysis of how the &euro;62 million cost of the centre was arrived at, how much was spent on consultant and project management and how much on actual building and design and to which individuals and companies payments were made?</P>
        <P>It has become apparent that the problems with the national aquatic centre are not only structural but that it is mired in a range of legal, contractual and financial difficulties. Court reports of Dublin Waterworld making payments of &euro;4.5 million for unspecified services to a subsidiary of the company that secured the contract for the national aquatic centre during a time when the parent company was in rent arrears of &euro;1 million beggar belief. Did the Government really hand over a State asset costing &euro;62 million to a company with a share capital of &euro;127 originally registered in the British Virgin Islands, a well-known tax haven?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister publish the details of the contract between CSID and Dublin Waterworld and any other companies associated with it? In <Col N="527"/>March, the Minister advised me, &ldquo;The concept of the National Aquatic Centre has been developed with a clear emphasis on commercial viability. The intention was that once built the facility would be a self-sustaining venture.&rdquo; These words are coming back to haunt him now.</P>
        <P>Even more scary than what has happened already to the national aquatic centre is the fact that the Government proposes to use this public private partnership-design build and operate procedure as a template for future substantial capital investments, including the national conference centre, about which we just heard, and the building of offices for decentralisation. Using this unique form of Government management of taxpayers&rsquo; money, no doubt the cost of decentralisation will easily top &euro;2 billion as this Government has lost the plot in regard to its capacity to manage infrastructural development.</P>
        <P>Even the Progressive Democrats are jumping ship and are criticising the national aquatic centre. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, said of the crisis that he was more than a little concerned when we were spending more on lawyers rather than on architects. For once the Progressive Democrats maths add up in that spending more on lawyers and less on architects equals a broken roof and a cracked pool.</P>
        <P>Another of the water slides in the national aquatic centre is called the master blaster. The masters of the national aquatic centre, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, and the Taoiseach, Bertie the Bather, have well and truly been blasted.</P>
        <P>We need an independent report into the project and the publication of the report carried out by the independent engineers into the damage to the roof. Some 60 employees were laid off for five months. In the two years of its life, the centre has been closed for five months and water sports have been badly damaged.</P>
        <P>The national aquatic centre is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s pet project &mdash; stage one of Abbotstown. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, are shareholders in CSID on behalf of taxpayers. They must come out of hiding and take responsibility. The Comptroller and Auditor General advised me on 31 March that &ldquo;these matters will be examined during the course of my audit of the accounts of CSID Limited.&rdquo; I hope the Comptroller and Auditor General will proceed to examine this saga as soon as possible to prevent further waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
        <P>During the 2002 general election, the Progressive Democrats in Dublin West had a campaign button calling on voters to flush the Bertie Bowl down the drain. It is the taxpayers&rsquo; money that is being flushed down the drain.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is well aware, legal proceedings have been taken by Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited, CSID, <Col N="528"/>the landlords of the national aquatic centre, against Dublin Waterworld Limited, the operators of the centre. This case is currently before the commercial court. As has been explained on a number of occasions to the Deputy, the existence of the court case precludes the Minister, who apologises for being unable to attend tonight, or CSID from speaking freely about the issues under dispute. To do so might jeopardise the outcome of the case. That, despite all the efforts of the Opposition, I will not do.</P>
        <P>I am happy to put the factual position on the record. At present CSID has a legal action in the commercial court against Dublin Waterworld, the operator of the national aquatic centre, for breaches of the lease. In the commercial court on 3 June, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly made an order in relation to the following matters, which were the subject of the statement of claim lodged by CSID against Dublin Waterworld. The dispute as to whether Dublin Waterworld is liable to pay over &euro;10 million of VAT on the granting of the lease has been referred to arbitration. This arbitration is taking place and will be concluded shortly. On repair and maintenance issues, the dispute as to whether Dublin Waterworld has properly managed the national aquatic centre has been referred to an architect for expert determination and again this process is under way. There are a number of issues involving the lease, including complaints that Dublin Waterworld failed to pay rent, failed to provide audited accounts &mdash; thus preventing the profit share to be calculated &mdash; failed to pay insurance on the building and failed to establish a sinking fund. These matters are still subject to court proceedings and are currently before the court. The most recent hearing was yesterday.</P>
        <P>Last evening, CSID issued a statement on the matters referred to by the Deputy and I would like to bring this statement to the attention of the House:</P>
        <P LI="1">CSID has stated that it is satisfied that the reports in the media relating to the National Aquatic Centre are inaccurate in many respects and would be inappropriate to comment on any of these issues as there are proceedings before the court at this time.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In the court yesterday, CSID&rsquo;s legal team referred to a situation that is growing murkier and murkier.</P>
        <P>I can give an assurance to the House, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, that the primary concern at all times has been to protect taxpayers&rsquo; investment in this and other projects. I will not play any part in the Opposition&rsquo;s determined efforts to undermine that position, even though Deputy Burton appears to have no compunction about making public statements on matters before the court. Once the court proceedings have been completed, CSID will no longer be constrained from putting the facts before the public and answering any questions Deputies, the media or anyone else may have <Col N="529"/>about the various matters at present before the court.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton has, over the past months, been loud in her comments about the damage caused to the centre on 1 January. It is unfortunate that the freak storm damaged the roof of the national aquatic centre.</P>

	<P>We cannot complain about any infrastructural development during the 1980s and 1990s when the Deputy&rsquo;s party was in Government because it provided little or no such development.

	<P>I need extra time. The damage at the national aquatic centre occurred on a day when the centre was closed for a holiday and there was no injury to staff or the public. CSID handled this situation immediately in an efficient and effective matter. CSID&rsquo;s first priority was to look to the safety of the general public and anybody using or working in the facility. It also focused on ensuring that the damage was accurately assessed by the insurance assessors, that repairs would be carried out as quickly as possible and that the debris in the vicinity of the facility was safely removed. To ensure the health and <Col N="530"/>safety of future users of the facility and to avoid a recurrence of the damage, expert consulting engineers were commissioned to provide an independent report on the situation.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, at the request of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Campus and Stadium Ireland Development Ltd., engaged Kavanagh Mansfield and Partners, consulting and structural engineers, to examine the damage and to provide a report as a matter of priority. The findings of this report guided the response of CSID. They were taken into account in agreeing the repair programme with the contractor and the consultants who carried out the report subsequently provided a service in overseeing the type and quality of the work carried out. This work was in addition to a report prepared by O&rsquo;Connor Sutton Cronin, an engineering consultancy appointed to examine the damage on behalf of the insurance company carrying the insurance cover on the national aquatic centre. It is important to be independently briefed to ensure that liability is appropriately assigned and that this misadventure is not billed to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has sought to have this independent report published and indeed it will be when the time is ripe. As has been explained to the Deputy on a number of occasions, there are legal, contractual and financial issues that are still on-going and are being negotiated in the light of this report. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to publish it or comment on its findings at this time.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism said in this House, just the week before last, that capital expenditure on the provision of this facility represented value for money and that is indeed the case. For years we have heard complaints about the lack of proper sporting infrastructure. This Government has made a tangible contribution in this field, delivering over &euro;600 million in capital investment in sports facilities since 1997, in sharp contrast to that provided from 1994 to 1997. The centre was only one of a number of significant state-of-the-art facilities which we have provided. Instead of giving credit where credit is due, or indeed supporting the endeavour, we have an Opposition that cannot wait to find fault and that rushes to criticise.</P>
        <P>The motivation of the Government in developing the national aquatic centre in the first place was to provide a 50-metre pool for Ireland&rsquo;s needs and to provide a suitable location for hosting the aquatic events of the Special Olympics. The project was delivered on time and within budget and resulted in games of which everyone could be proud. The centre has justly drawn well-deserved admiration from those who have visited it and used its facilities. Since the centre was opened to the public in March 2003, it has successfully hosted the Special Olympics and later that year the European short course championships &mdash; both to significant acclaim. In its first year of operations it had close to 1 million visit<Col N="531"/>ors, which placed the facility among the top attractions in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Today the centre continues to be equally popular as a facility for those who love water sport, especially young people, tourists and swimmers of all ages and abilities. Despite suggestions to the contrary by the Deputy, the reality is that the centre is fully operational and bringing endless enjoyment to adults and children alike, as well as providing a top class facility for our swimming athletes.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on the provision of a new school at Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in Ballincollig, County Cork. Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is an excellent school which is operation for over 20 years. It is a testimony to the work that has been put in by the staff, management, the parents and pupils of the school. Unfortunately, the building in which the school is currently housed has outgrown its usefulness. What are the plans to ensure that a new Gaelscoil is built in Ballincollig? This has been the subject of an ongoing debate between the education partners in the school and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The partners are quite concerned about the lack of facilities in the school. There is a major concern regarding the safety of children as the school is next to a busy main road and another congested road on an adjoining housing estate. The building is not suitable for disabled children or wheelchair usage. At this stage, every school in the country should be wheelchair accessible. The parking facilities adjacent to the school are very poor and parking for parents at busy periods causes some disruption to the nearby residents. There is no gymnasium or hall which can be used as a gymnasium. There is an almost total lack of learning support in the school. The external play area is very confined and far from ideal due to the steep sloping nature of the small site on which the school is situated. As the external playing area is so small, break time is divided up between lunch and play to allow the children more space. It is the only school I have visited that has to keep children in during break time due to lack of room in the playground.</P>
        <P>There are no facilities on the school grounds for nature studies. The lack of toilet facilities in the classrooms cause a particular problem for children in the junior classes. Many of the toilets are accessible directly off the open corridors and not in their own rooms. The corridors in the school are very narrow and lead to a congested atmosphere in the school at times. The school building is rented and there has always been a fear that the landlord may not choose to renew lease when the current lease expires.</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P>The Department needs to ensure that a new facility is provided in Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in. The latest extension was built with a view to the rooms being let out individually when the building would no longer be used as a school. It was obviously not designed as a school building. The school is located in a densely residential area and that causes problems for local residents. We need clarification from the Department of Education and Science to ensure that a new building is provided to Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in Ballincollig, which has provided an excellent service over the last 20 years. I congratulate all the school partners in Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in for their excellent working relationship and their great school. I ask the Minister of State to outline the plans, if any, of the Department of Education and Science for this school.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the proposals of the Department of Education and Science on the provision of a new school building for Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Ballincollig, County Cork. I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, who is unable to attend the House this evening.</P>
        <P>The Government decision to close the Murphy barracks complex in Ballincollig was seen by the Department as an excellent opportunity to acquire a suitable site on which to provide permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil U&iacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in. Following this decision, it was agreed that an area of approximately 1.7 acres would be provided on which to build a new school building for the Gaelscoil. The school would also have immediate access to adjacent playing fields. Contract documents for the transfer of ownership of the site were forwarded to the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. However, since then a number of issues have arisen.</P>
        <P>The map included in the contract documentation shows that there are wayleaves crossing the site which would have the impact of significantly reducing the area available on which to build. These wayleaves were not flagged originally when the site was reserved for the Department of Education and Science. In addition, a local authority road bordering part of the site may be widened to facilitate the overall development of the barracks and could result in further reducing the amount of land available for the proposed school building.</P>
        <P>Officials at the Department of Education and Science have written to the local authority seeking clarification of the issues raised above. The question of the acquisition of the site will be addressed immediately on receipt of a response from the local authority.</P>
        <P>The Department is acutely aware of the need to provide permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil U&iacute; Riord&aacute;in, as has been borne out comprehensively by the Minister, Deputy Martin, in his submission this evening. The Department is aware of the need to provide accommodation for <Col N="533"/>the Gaelscoil and is determined to progress the issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I assure Deputy Moynihan that I have listened to the case he made and noted the points raised. I will communicate his views directly to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, at the first available opportunity, which will possibly be tomorrow morning.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The 1999 air quality daughter directive relates to limit values for various air pollutants in ambient air, including particulate matter, PM, and oxides of nitrogen, NOx. In accordance with Article 10, the directive was reviewed by the European Commission and a review report was issued in January 2005.</P>
        <P>The criterion for defining particulate matter in the 1999 directive is aerodynamic diameter. The origin of the particulate matter does not affect this definition and particles from natural sources, such as Sahara sand and sea salt, are therefore included in the scope of the directive. However, the directive allows individual member states to apply for derogations from any requirement to address exceedances where elevated levels of particulates arise as a result of certain specified circumstances, such as high wind events or transport of natural particles from dry regions. In its report on the review of the directive, the European Commission has stated that it is not considering changing or extending the existing derogation provisions.</P>
        <P>In Ireland&rsquo;s case, there is no necessity to seek a derogation. The Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for implementing the air quality framework directive in Ireland and annually publishes an overview of ambient air quality. The most recent air quality and emissions to air report 2003, shows that Ireland&rsquo;s air quality remains good, without any breach of national and EU standards in force. Specifically, the ambient levels of particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen, including whatever contribution there may be from Saharan sand and sea salt, are in compliance with the standards. The report is available in the Library.</P>
        <P>Under the sixth environmental action programme, the Commission will later this year adopt a thematic strategy on air pollution as an outcome of the EU CAFE programme. The objective of this is to develop a comprehensive, integrated and coherent framework for all air legislation and <Col N="538"/>related policy initiatives. The Commission&rsquo;s review report on the 1999 daughter directive will inform the development of the thematic strategy. Ireland, along with all member states, participates in the CAFE steering group at which the work of the working group on implementation was assessed and evaluated.</P>

	<P>I have already indicated that I believe my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.environ.ie</i>, is in need of some improvement in terms of content architecture and presentation. Design and development of a major reworking of the site is under way and an entirely new layout is planned. The Department is aiming to have the new site in place before the end of the year. In the meantime, interim revisions mentioned in an earlier reply to a parliamentary question have been implemented. These substantially address concerns about the site&rsquo;s usability and improve the performance, accessibility, look and feel of the site.</P>
        <P>In addition to <i>www.environ.ie</i>, my Department operates some 13 special interest websites dealing with particular aspects of the Department&rsquo;s activities. In recent years extensive changes have been made to reflect the changed structure of the Department and to provide direct access from the main Department site to newly developed sites such as &ldquo;Motor Tax Online&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buildings of Ireland&rdquo;, as well as the specialist websites relating to Met &Eacute;ireann and heritage areas.</P>
        <P>The award winning <i>www.motortax.ie</i>, which enables customers to pay their motor tax over the Internet, is recognised as an effective e-government measure. In its first year, this site has handled over 470,000 transactions representing over &euro;100 million in revenue. Almost 24% of eligible motor tax business nationally is now transacted on-line, including over 43% of eligible business in the Dublin area. This is a welcome success and one that we intend to build on in the years to come.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 52, 103 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>The recent leakage at the THORP reprocessing plant in the Sellafield complex has underscored the legitimacy of Government policy that Sellafield should be closed in a safe and orderly manner because of the threat it poses to Ireland. While the leak was contained and did not constitute an immediate hazard to the local population or region or to Ireland, the fact of its occurrence and subsequent revelations concerning its origin, <Col N="540"/>quantity and the period it remained undetected do not promote confidence in the management and operation of the site.</P>
        <P>A discrepancy in the amounts of uranium and plutonium in the THORP process was first noticed on 18 April and, following camera inspections, the process was shut down on 21 April. Further investigation showed that 83,000 litres or 83 cubic metres of liquid, which contains uranium, plutonium and fission products, was spilt but was contained on the floor of a sealed cell with walls several feet thick.</P>
        <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland was advised of the leak by the UK&rsquo;s Health and Safety Executive and Environment Agency on the same day the process was shut down, 21 April 2005. Officials of my Department were advised on 22 April. The institute deals directly with the UK regulatory authorities, not BNFL, in accessing information and has kept in touch with its counterparts in the UK on the issues arising from the incident. The institute has been satisfied with the quality and timing of the information flow from the UK authorities and has no reason to doubt the integrity or accuracy of the information received to date.</P>
        <P>On 27 May 2005, British Nuclear Group, formerly BNFL, issued the findings of an internal investigation of the THORP incident. The findings do not have any implications for Ireland and confirmed that the leak which had occurred had been contained in the secondary containment area designed for this purpose. However, the investigation also found that the pipe may have started to fail in August 2004 and that actual failure of the pipe may have occurred in January 2005 and, although the failure itself could not have been prevented, the quantity of liquid released would have been significantly less if opportunities had not been missed in the monitoring of the process.</P>
        <P>I understand that an independent investigation is currently underway by the UK regulatory authority. I have requested the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and departmental officials to liaise closely with their counterparts in the UK on this investigation and any other issues of concern arising from the incident.</P>
        <P>The THORP incident is an extremely serious one, as is reflected in the class 3 rating applied to the incident under the international nuclear event scale. Accordingly, I have raised the issue directly in writing with the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and have sought an early meeting. Furthermore, I have also drawn the THORP incident to the attention of the European Commissioner for Energy.</P>
        <P>I understand that, at a minimum, it will take several months before it will be possible for the THORP plant to resume operation. While there is wide speculation that this incident may precipitate a further evaluation of the reprocessing operations at THORP, resulting in an earlier closure <Col N="541"/>date than 2010 as is currently proposed, I am not aware of any decisions on this issue by the UK. However, the recent incident offers the opportunity to the UK to decide on the termination of reprocessing operations at Sellafield as soon as possible. Obviously, this will be among the issues I will pursue with my UK ministerial counterparts when we meet.</P>

	<P>The International Symposium on Uranium Production and Raw Materials for the Nuclear Fuel Cycle, organised by the International Atomic Energy Agency, took place in Vienna last week. My Department, in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and based on an evaluation of priorities, decided not to nominate an official representative to the uranium symposium.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the symposium was to analyse uranium supply and demand relationships and to present and discuss new developments in uranium geology and exploration, mining, processing and environmental requirements for uranium operations and site decommissioning. The symposium followed on from an international conference Uranium Geochemistry 2003 in Nancy in 2003 and an earlier symposium Uranium Production Cycle and the Environment in Vienna in 2000, both of which were also organised by the agency. Although Ireland was not represented at the symposium, we will, of course, have access to the outcomes of the symposium when these are available.</P>
        <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency, comprising some 136 member states is an independent, intergovernmental agency of the United Nations. The agency is <i>inter alia</i> responsible for the establishment and administration of safeguards and verification, the maintenance of a global event notification system, the promotion of research and development into the application of atomic energy, the establishment of safety standards and the assistance of member states in planning for and using nuclear science and technology for various peaceful purposes.</P>
        <P>To this end, the agency organises numerous conferences and symposia in any given year. Furthermore, the policy-making organs &mdash; board of governors, programme and budget committee and so forth &mdash; typically meet ten to 12 times a year and the annual general conference takes place each September. My Department or the institute does not have the resources to attend all of these meetings and conferences and, conse<Col N="542"/>quently, has to be selective in terms of accepting invitations that will most directly assist and promote Ireland&rsquo;s nuclear policy and provide necessary technical advice and assistance.</P>
        <P>Government policy is opposed to the use of nuclear energy, as it believes the environmental, health and safety risks and impacts outweigh the benefits arising from the industry. Ireland remains opposed to any expansion of the nuclear industry, which potentially impacts negatively on uranium exploration, production and related issues. Based on an analysis of the content and relevance of international meetings, Ireland is represented at as many as possible and seeks to influence processes in accordance with Government policy.</P>

	<P>The Local Government Act 2001 modernises the legislative framework, supports community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy and underpins generally the programme of local government renewal, including the position of county and city councils as the primary units of local government. Under the Act, there are five city councils and also five borough councils, including Drogheda, each of which is responsible for a significant range of legal and administrative functions in their respective areas as well as contributing to local development in co-operation with their respective county council.</P>
        <P>The Act takes account of the recommendations of the 1996 report of the reorganisation commission, Towards Cohesive Local Government &mdash; Town and County, regarding improved accessibility, interaction and linkages for all boroughs and towns with their local county council areas as the way forward. A modernised legal framework and structures at both regional and local level are now in place which provide the necessary powers and flexibility to local authorities to work in partnership at local and regional level to co-ordinate the provision of integrated public services. In these circumstances, I have no proposals for amending legislation, which would be necessary to establish a new city council.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 136 together.</P>
        <P>The NESC housing report endorses the Government&rsquo;s general approach to housing policy while highlighting important policy challenges ahead. These include ensuring a high quality sustainable development in both urban and rural areas, assisting the market to maintain a high level of supply and providing an effective range of supports to those households who fall below the affordability threshold.</P>
        <P>We have being making substantial progress in addressing these concerns, with record overall housing output and increased investment in social and affordable housing. The new affordable homes partnership announced last week provides new impetus and additionality to the existing measures. The partnership will drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, GDA. It is also intended that the partnership take responsibility, as far as practicable, for affordable housing initiative projects on State lands in the GDA. This will include use of the land swap option, similar to that piloted on the Harcourt Terrace Lane site.</P>
        <P>Initially, the partnership will work via the existing planning/development framework but additional legislative powers will be made avail<Col N="544"/>able should they prove necessary. In addition, consideration is to be given to approaches dealing with land options and a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; scheme. As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brown field land and derelict sites.</P>
        <P>These measures are designed to provide a practical response, focused on delivery on the policy challenges identified by the NESC. The NESC also highlighted a number of issues, particularly in the social housing area, for further consideration. The Government intends to address these more medium-term issues for the provision of social and affordable housing in the early autumn. This process will be informed by the outcome of the statutory housing needs assessment currently under way and the work under way by the housing forum in reviewing the effectiveness of the existing social and affordable housing schemes in the context of the Sustaining Progress agreement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The policy direction which I have recently issued under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 directs the local authorities to ensure that the requirements of section 22 of that Act are fully met in the current review of their waste management plans.</P>
        <P>Section 22 states that a waste management plan shall include information on: the identification of sites at which waste disposal or recovery activities have been carried on; the assessment of any risk of environmental pollution arising as a result of such activities; measures proposed to be taken or, where such an assessment has already been made, measures taken, to prevent or limit any such environmental pollution; and the identification of necessary remedial measures in respect of such sites and measures proposed to be taken or, where such measures have already been identified, measures taken, to achieve such remediation, having regard to the cost effectiveness of available remediation techniques. This exercise will be completed as part of the process of replacing the current waste management plans over the coming months.</P><Col N="545"/>
        <P>As regards remediation costs related to illegal dumping, the regulatory authorities have been directed to pursue illegal holders of waste, looking to the maximum potential sanctions available in law. In that regard, prosecutions should be taken in all cases using the powers available under the Waste Management Act, as amended, or other relevant legislation to maximise the deterrent factor. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be asked to become involved in regard to more serious offences and the prosecution of offences should be at the highest available judicial level.</P>
        <P>In addition, a landfill levy shall be applied in all circumstances of disposal of waste by means of an unauthorised landfill activity after 1 June 2002, when the landfill levy regulations came into effect, and local authorities should, where practicable, pursue civil remedies against illegal operators under the provisions of sections 55 to 58 of the Act, for example, to seek to recover the costs of measures taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the waste.</P>
        <P>Clearly there may also be cost implications related to the remediation of older sites, which may not be amenable to recovery in the courts from those concerned. There may also be cost implications for closed sites which are or were in the ownership of local authorities. Pending the outcome of the section 22 process it is not possible to quantify the extent of future costs in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 44, 45, 116 and 127 together.</P>
        <P>The most recent waste management policy statement, Taking Stock and Moving Forward, April 2004, recognised that the prohibition on all inter-regional movements of waste could be unduly restrictive in terms of securing the development of waste infrastructure and the objectives of waste management plans. It is the case that most waste facilities currently in place are not subject to conditions which limit the geographic area from which they can take waste. In fact, the absence of such restrictions has traditionally allowed local authorities to manage capacity constraints by providing for inter-regional movement of waste. Accordingly, the policy statement provided for an examination of the issues arising in terms of the inter-relationship between regional boundaries and waste facilities.</P>
        <P>Concerns about the implications of such planning conditions were expressed to my Department by stakeholders from both the public and private sectors and, in particular, by the Irish Waste Management Association. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency in its 2001 waste database report recommended that the inter-regional movement and treatment of waste should be provided for in appropriate circumstances.</P>
        <P>Following legal advice, I recently issued guidance under section 60 of the Waste Management Act to clarify that the application of the proximity principle in the context of waste management does not entail interpreting administrative waste boundaries in such a manner as to inhibit the development of infrastructure which will support the attainment of national waste policy objectives. This guidance is intended to provide greater clarity in regard to the appropriate application of the proximity principle so as to facilitate the provision of environmentally sustainable and economically viable waste infrastructure in accordance with national policy. I am advised that this guidance has been well received by both the public and private stakeholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Action to protect the habitats of rare and endangered wild bird <Col N="547"/>species is most directly addressed by designation of sites as special protection areas, SPAs. To date, Ireland has designated 128 SPAs, covering an area equivalent to almost 3% of our land area and statutory orders are in preparation to designate some further sites. Designation of habitats under other provisions, for example, as candidate special areas of conservation can also support the preservation of wild bird species.</P>
        <P>However, the EU Commission is taking a case against Ireland in the European Court of Justice, alleging inadequate implementation of the directive. A major element of the Commission&rsquo;s case relates to sites for relatively dispersed rare species, such as hen harrier, chough and corncrake. An additional element of the Commission&rsquo;s case requires Ireland to ensure that all SPAs, including those designated under the system which applied pre-habitats directive, should now be subject to the procedures under the habitats directive.</P>
        <P>Proposals for SPAs for hen harriers are being finalised within my Department, taking account of up to date information on the extent of recent afforestation provided by the forest service of the Department of Agriculture and Food. My Department is committed, when this information has been assessed, to further consultation with stakeholder interests about the implications of such designations before the details of the sites are published and notified to landowners. Proposals for SPAs for chough, mainly in coastal cliff areas of Kerry, west Cork and west Donegal are also being finalised. The implications of these proposals will also be discussed with landowners&rsquo; representatives. With regard to both these species, it is envisaged that sites will be statutorily proposed later this year.</P>
        <P>A number of existing SPAs provide protection for corncrake, along with other species. The question of designation of further sites for corncrake remains under consideration. Certain other dispersed species also require designation of sites. For species such as merlin and golden plover this can largely be achieved by designation as SPAs of lands already protected as candidate special areas of conservation, SACs, under the habitats directive.</P>

	<P>The statutory provisions for the making of regional planning guidelines are contained in the Planning and Development Act 2000. Under these provisions, I have issued directions to regional authorities and published regulations on the making of regional planning guidelines. My Department has also <Col N="548"/>issued guidance notes to regional authorities to assist them in this process.</P>
        <P>In accordance with my direction, the Dublin regional authority and the mid-east regional authority, in May 2004, jointly made regional planning guidelines for the whole of the area of their two regions, that is, the area known as the greater Dublin area. These guidelines replaced the non-statutory strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area 1999 and incorporated the aims and policies of the national spatial strategy.</P>
        <P>My Department was represented on a steering committee which assisted in the preparation of the regional planning guidelines and also on the technical working group which supported this work.</P>

        <P>The Government decision in February 2000 to move to electronic voting and counting aimed to secure a range of identified benefits compared to <Col N="551"/>the current manual arrangements, including: more democratic outcomes through the minimisation of invalid votes and the more accurate counting of votes; provision of a higher level of service to the public; greater flexibility and speed in the voting and counting processes; and greater use of modern information and communication technologies. The decision followed extensive research on electronic voting systems and experiences in other countries and input from a range of sources on legislative, financial and practical considerations.</P>
        <P>As part of a programme of further assessment, testing and validation of the electronic voting and counting system, tenders have been sought, and are now being assessed, from suitably qualified consultants to undertake a security and risk assessment of all aspects of the system and to devise a programme of additional testing. This work is intended to address issues raised by the Commission on Electronic Voting and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately.</P>
        <P>The total cost to date of the electronic voting and counting project is some &euro;52 million. My Department is not considering, or quantifying the cost of, the approaches to the project set out in the questions, nor have we had contact with other jurisdictions in the matter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 138 together.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s report, Water Quality in Ireland 2001-2003, stated that the overall condition of Irish waters <Col N="552"/>remains satisfactory and compares favourably with the position in other European countries. The report indicates that there is a further decline in the extent of serious pollution in rivers, a decline in the level of bacteriological contamination of ground water and that water quality is generally high in estuaries and coastal areas.</P>
        <P>I welcome these positive findings of the report. Other findings of the report, however, are more mixed, such as the slight increase in the extent of river channel affected by pollution, the decrease in the number of bathing areas which comply with guideline values and the widespread intermittent contamination of ground waters with faecal coliforms. The report also confirms that eutrophication is extensive in surface waters and emphasises the need for control of nutrient losses from all sources.</P>
        <P>It is right that all sources of pollution should be addressed, whether arising in agriculture, urban waste water, industry or any other activity. A wide range of measures is being progressed for this purpose, including a national nitrates action programme, to protect waters against pollution from agriculture, the comprehensive strengthening of river basin management in the context of implementation of the water framework directive and under the water services investment programme, which incorporates the rural water programme, regarding the treatment of waste water discharges and the provision of drinking water supplies.</P>
        <P>In so far as waste water discharges are concerned, the EPA report points to the need for continued investment in the upgrading of our waste water treatment plants and makes reference to specific areas that merit ongoing attention, such as nutrient removal from waste water discharges and the need to address point source pollution from sewage treatment plants. In the region of &euro;1.7 billion was invested in new waste water infrastructure under the national development plan in the four year period up to the end of 2004. As a result, enormous strides have been made in meeting our targets under the EU urban waste water treatment directive and in improving the quality of the receiving waters.</P>
        <P>Compliance with the December 2005 deadline of the directive, which requires secondary treatment for discharges from agglomerations to a population equivalent of 2000 or more in the case of fresh or estuarial waters, stood at 25% at the start of the NDP. That has now risen to some 90%. All remaining schemes needed to achieve full compliance with the directive are included in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>The increase in waste water treatment capacity in the 2001-04 period is equivalent to the needs of a population of some 2.9 million &mdash; seven times more than the increase achieved over the entire duration of the previous NDP from 1994 to 1999. The commitment in the programme for government for secondary waste water treatment facili<Col N="553"/>ties to be put in place for every location with a population of more than 1,000 is also now being implemented under the water services investment programme.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently examining the EPA report with a view to identifying any municipal waste water discharges where investment in new or upgraded waste water infrastructure is required that has not already been provided for in the current phase of the water services investment programme. It should also be borne in mind that the EPA&rsquo;s water quality in Ireland report covers the period up to 2003 and does not take account of the many new waste water treatment plants that have been commissioned in the meantime.</P>

	<P>Since the establishment in 2004 by the Office of Environmental Enforcement of a national enforcement network, there has been regular contact between relevant officials from the Environment and Heritage Service of Northern Ireland and our own enforcement authorities.</P>
        <P>The function of the enforcement network is to harness the collective resources, expertise and investigative capacity of all the players engaged in dealing with environmental crime in Ireland. The participants include all the local authorities, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including its national bureau of criminal investigations, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Environment and Heritage Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland.</P><Col N="554"/>
        <P>A priority initial focus of the network is to deal with unauthorised waste activity in Ireland and, in particular, the issue of illegal cross-Border movement of waste from the Republic of Ireland into Northern Ireland. The network is bringing a level of consistency and focus to waste enforcement in Ireland that did not exist prior to its establishment and targeted roadblocks and inspections of suspect premises have occurred. Senior officials from my Department will meet their Northern Ireland counterparts on 30 June to exchange views on a range of waste management issues, including criminal activity.

	<P>Ireland&rsquo;s positive but precautionary policy on modern biotechnology is based on the work of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology, October 2000, whose report was endorsed by the Government. The report concluded that we should acknowledge the potential benefits of genetic engineering while maintaining a fundamental commitment to safety and environmental sustainability, based on scientific risk assessment and management.</P>
        <P>With regard to crops and foodstuffs, the authorisation of genetically modified products takes place at EU level and each member state has an input to the process. Each individual proposal is considered on its own merits, taking particular account of the advice of the relevant advisory agencies.

	<P>The amended part L &mdash; conservation of fuel and energy &mdash; of the building regulations 2002 and the related technical guidance document E, 2002 edition, came into effect on 1 January 2003 and set significantly higher insulation levels and thermal per<Col N="555"/>formance standards for new dwellings, including apartments, subject to the transitional exemption of new dwellings for which planning permission had been applied for on or before 31 December 2002. This transitional provision will expire on 31 December 2005. In accordance with Article 4 of the EU energy performance of buildings directive, 2002/91/EC, part L standards will again be reviewed by 2008.</P>
        <P>Part E &mdash; sound &mdash; of the building regulations 1997 and the related technical guidance document E, 1997 edition, sets out requirements for sound insulation in buildings. HomeBond is carrying out a major study of sound insulation standards in Ireland and selected other EU member states, which is due to be completed by the end of this year. I intend to initiate a review of part E and the related technical guidance document E in 2006, in the light of the results of the HomeBond study and in consultation with the building regulations advisory body, BRAB.</P>
        <P>The Building Control Act 1990 assigns responsibility for complying with the building regulations, including parts L and E, primarily to the owners, designers and builders of the buildings involved. Under the 1990 Act, local building control authorities are empowered to monitor buildings for compliance with the building regulations and to take enforcement action where necessary.</P>

	<P>The provision of office accommodation for a local authority is primarily a matter for the local authority concerned. Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001 requires local authorities to obtain sanction to borrow money. Under this provision, 19 local authorities received sanction, in the period 2000 to 2004, to borrow a total of &euro;252 million for the provision, extension or refurbishment of local authority headquarter offices. In each case, the decision to borrow for these purposes is a reserved function and requires a formal resolution of the council.</P>

	<P>Waste enforcement activities in individual cases are primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned and/or the office of environmental enforcement. However, section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 authorises the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give general directions to the Environmental Protection Agency and/or local authorities on waste management plans, waste licensing, the movement of waste and other matters. The powers conferred by section 60 do not extend to individual cases. The legislation precludes the Minister from exercising any power or control regarding the performance in particular circumstances by the agency or a local authority of their waste management functions.</P>
        <P>On 3 May 2005, I gave policy directions under section 60 which addressed both action against illegal waste activity and movement of waste. With regard to the former, the stated purpose of the direction was to encourage an intensification of action against illegal waste activity, which includes unauthorised disposal of waste, such as the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste, and enhance the response of local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency in ensuring the protection of the environment and human health and the prosecution of offenders. In determining the nature of such prosecutions regard is to be had to the elimination of the economic benefit deriving from the illegal activity.</P>
        <P>Key features of the policy direction include: enhancing the response of local authorities in ensuring the protection of the environment and the health of local communities, including appropriate respect for the property rights of individual householders; a recognition that law abiding waste operators are being put at a disadvantage by the illegal operators; ensuring that local authorities are directed to draw up an inventory of all sites where illegal waste recovery or disposal has taken place; adequate management and monitor<Col N="557"/>ing to ensure that immediate and longer term impacts are assessed and addressed at the affected sites; and removal of all hazardous waste. The direction specifically requires that particular consideration be given to certain sites: lands near to existing or planned residential development or educational facilities; wetlands; natural heritage areas, candidate special areas of conservation or special protection areas; and places of special interest such as high amenity areas.</P>
        <P>The proposal of the Environmental Protection Agency to reinforce this general policy direction with a detailed code of practice using its powers under the Environmental Protection Act is also welcome. The recent direction has clarified the policy framework while the agency, as primary regulator and supervisor of local authorities in regard to the environment, will supplement this with the necessary supporting technical detail.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 115 together.</P>
        <P>My Department has not contested the ownership of the <i>Lusitania</i>. In 1995, following reports of divers, concerns were raised regarding the integrity of the <i>Lusitania</i> wreck and an underwater heritage order was placed on it. The effect of the order was to extend to the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i> the same protection under the National Monuments Acts as would automatically apply to historic wrecks over 100 years old in Irish territorial waters. Archaeologists from my Department applied the same procedures to the wreck site as operate for other wrecks protected under the legislation.</P>
        <P>The owner of the <i>Lusitania</i> sought a judicial review of the Minister&rsquo;s decision to refuse a licence under section 3(5) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987. The High Court judgment, which was delivered on 17 June 2005, is currently under consideration in my Department in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office. The judgment is complex but <i>inter alia</i> the High Court found that the provisions of section 3(5) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 applied to the wreck. However, in the particular circumstances the refusal of the section 3(5) licence in 2001 was deemed <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister. Legal costs in respect of this action have not yet been determined.</P>

	<P>It is recognised that a comprehensive data system is essential to monitor progress in addressing homelessness. In response to this, the Homeless Agency, in conjunction with homeless service providers in Dublin, developed the LINK system in 2001 with funding provided by my Department. The purpose of the system is to improve and develop services and service delivery to homeless persons to ensure they receive a continuum of care based on an accurate and up to date assessment of their needs.</P>
        <P>The LINK system is intended to help the local authorities to formulate appropriate responses to the accommodation needs of homeless households and individuals. It also facilitates the identification of their non-accommodation requirements and provides a basis for appropriate responses to their case and support needs by the statutory and voluntary agencies involved. Currently, 23 different services in eight different organisations use the system. These include emergency accommodation providers, advice and information services, outreach teams and settlement services. It is intended to extend the usage of LINK to all services in Dublin as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to its development in other local authority areas, it is considered appropriate to finalise its installation in the Dublin area before any future extension of the system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 85, 106, 124 and 790 together.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to ascribe any individual death directly to exposure to radon, particularly as a recent European study published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 21 December 2004 shows that the risk of contracting lung cancer from radon is 25 times greater for smokers. However, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland estimates that about 10% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths in Ireland may be linked to radon. This equates to about 150 to 200 lung cancer deaths annually.</P>
        <P>The Government has in recent years, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. In addition, my Department, in June 1997, introduced upgraded building regulations which required all new houses which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures at the time of construction. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of technical guidance document C on part C of the building regulations &mdash; site preparation and resistance to moisture &mdash; incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon protection measures are carried out more effectively.</P>
        <P>The updated technical guidance document also recommends, but does not require, that radon levels be measured after completion and occupation of new buildings to verify that the radon levels are below the national reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre, Bq/m3. I do not, however, propose to make such measurements mandatory and my Department is not aware of any equivalent mandatory requirement in building regulations within the EU or elsewhere.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the institute has published the results of radon surveys undertaken by it of a number of houses in Kilkenny built before and after July 1998 when the updated 1997 regulations standards came into effect. The most recent survey, in Kilkenny, showed that of the 33 post-July 1998 built houses surveyed, three, or 10%, had radon concentrations above the national reference level, including one which had radon concentrations of over seven times the reference level. However, the survey results also showed a reduction of some 33% in the average radon concentrations in the post-July 1998 built houses compared with the average concentration for houses surveyed by the institute under its <Col N="563"/>national radon survey in the earlier part of that decade.</P>
        <P>While the recent survey results from the institute demonstrate the positive impact of the radon preventative measures required under the 1997 building regulations, they also demonstrate that the building regulations alone are not a guarantee that houses are completely protected against radon. The enhanced radon prevention measures for new houses, which I announced last October and which call for radon sump outlets to be clearly identified, should help to further raise awareness among householders and the building industry.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to introduce a countrywide programme to test the radon levels in all homes in the State. A major nationwide radon survey was undertaken by the institute in the 1990s. In all, over 11,000 houses were measured. Of these, about 9% had radon concentration above the national reference level. On the basis of this survey, the RPII has estimated that about 91,000 houses or 7% of the national housing stock would have radon concentration above the reference level.</P>
        <P>The institute is concerned that only a little over 3,000 of the 91,000 houses in the country estimated to have radon concentration above the reference level have been identified. Therefore, within the past 12 months, the institute has been intensifying its campaign to further heighten public awareness of radon. The institute&rsquo;s new initiatives have included publishing a booklet entitled Understanding Radon &mdash; A Householder&rsquo;s Guide and the production of an information poster for display in public places such as libraries, medical centres and so forth. In addition, the institute has recently embarked on a series of nationwide public information seminars which will be targeted at selected high radon areas. These seminars have received widespread media coverage and have generated a large number of inquiries from the public.</P>
        <P>There are positive indications that the institute&rsquo;s radon awareness programmes are impacting on the public. I understand that in 2004 the number of requests for radon measurements received by the institute from householders was almost 3,000, which was more than the combined total for the previous three years. Testing of domestic dwellings for radon is straightforward and inexpensive, approximately &euro;40 per home. I urge householders, particular those in high radon areas, to check their house for radon concentrations and carry out remediation work if recommended to do so.</P>
        <P>Both my Department and the institute will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness on the dangers of radon and every effort will continue to be directed at improving information to householders so as to enable them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>

	<P>The administration of the disabled person&rsquo;s grants scheme is delegated to local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations; as far as practicable, this is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility at local level. The majority of authorities have reviewed their schemes in recent years to streamline their operation and have introduced a variety of mechanisms to ensure that the available resources are targeted to those in most need. In a number of cases, including in the local authority referred to in the question, this includes a claw-back mechanism whereby the grant advanced is secured by way of a charge on the property for a certain number of years.</P><Col N="565"/>
        <P>In the event of the property being sold or otherwise transferred within that period, a certain proportion of the grant advanced would fall to be repaid to the local authority. This is intended to ensure that works which are grant-aided serve the needs of a disabled person for a certain specified minimum period of time. The issue of claw-backs will be considered further within the overall context of the review of the operation of the disabled person&rsquo;s grants scheme which has been under way in my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of the national development plan, spending by local authorities on social <Col N="567"/>housing has been ahead of target. My Department, in its overall responsibility for managing housing capital budgets, seeks to ensure that these are allocated in accordance with individual needs to ensure that these resources are spent as effectively as possible. Where one authority might not require its full capital allocation in a particular year, my Department makes reassignments of balances to other authorities to cater for the increased pace of construction activity on other housing schemes.</P>
        <P>The Government is allocating record levels of funding to local authorities for their social and affordable housing programmes in 2005. The total Exchequer capital funding available for social and affordable housing in 2005, taking account of the additional resources announced in the budget, will be almost &euro;1.18 billion, which represents an increase of 17% on the outturn in 2004.</P>
        <P>In association with this funding, my Department initiated the development by local authorities of new five-year action plans for social and affordable housing, to ensure a systematic and integrated approach to the effective use of these resources. Given the nature of continuous housing need, the preparation of these action plans is beneficial to local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years and providing a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. All of these action plans have now been approved by my Department.</P>

	<P>Subsequent to the approval of the Waterford bypass road scheme by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, test archaeological investigations were carried out which revealed the existence of the Viking site at Woodstown. A proposal to preserve the site underneath the road was made to my Department. An internal working document, evaluating various options including full excavation and preservation under the road, suggested <i>inter alia</i> that preservation under the road could be the most cost effective option. At the same time, as the nature of the site became clearer, there were ongoing consultations with the road authority and the National Museum of Ireland on the optimum solution for this site.</P>
        <P>In August 2004 the Minister directed that further investigations be carried out to assist <Col N="568"/>assessment of the archaeological nature and potential of the site. Subsequent to the carrying out of these studies, the NRA indicated that it favoured an alternative route.</P>
        <P>On 11 May 2005 I issued directions requiring the protection of the Viking site. I am currently setting up a working group to advise on the long-term strategy to deal with the site. The working group will include representatives of my Department, the National Museum of Ireland, Waterford City Council and the NRA.</P>

        <Quest>his plan of action for the improvement in the quality of groundwater sources, in particular for drinking purposes, particularly with regard to the high instance of faecal coliforms and to the guide limit exceedence of nitrate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, where any person carries out an activity that involves a risk to groundwater, that person carries primary responsibility for protecting the groundwater against pollution. Among public authorities, responsibility for the protection of groundwater is assigned principally to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related regulations. In addition, local authorities have statutory responsibilities for the provision of drinking water supplies, for upholding the quality standards prescribed by the European Communities drinking water regulations 2000 and for protection of drinking water sources, including groundwater drinking water sources.</P>
        <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, exercises general supervision of the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions and has responsibility for groundwater protection in the context of its own licensing, monitoring and other functions. Guidelines on the preparation of groundwater protection schemes have been developed by the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland and my Department and issued to local authorities.</P>
        <P>Monitoring of the overall quality of groundwaters is undertaken by both the local authorities and the EPA in the context of its national groundwater quality monitoring programme. Data generated by the programme are included in the EPA reports, Water Quality in Ireland, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library. The report for the period 2001-03 indicates localised pollution of groundwater in certain areas but no widespread pollution of particular aquifers.</P>
        <P>In addition, monitoring is carried out by both local authorities and the EPA in the context of <Col N="569"/>monitoring the quality of drinking water supplies. The most recent EPA report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland, 2003, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library, confirms that the overall quality of drinking water in Ireland remains generally high. The overall compliance rate for all supplies in 2003 was 96.1%, an improvement of 0.2% on the 2002 compliance rate. The report also confirms continued improvement in the compliance rate for faecal coliforms in both public and group water supplies. The 2003 report confirmed over 99% compliance with the nitrate standard in drinking water schemes.</P>
        <P>The majority of problems encountered with drinking water supplies in Ireland occur in private group water schemes. While breaches in water quality standards in these schemes are generally not extreme, my Department is giving high priority to the remediation of quality problems where they occur. Under my Department&rsquo;s rural water programme, a record &euro;125 million is provided in 2005 for improving the quality of rural water supplies, particularly the privately sourced group water schemes.</P>
        <P>In addition, a national nitrates action programme is being developed to give further effect to the nitrates directive, 91/676/EEC, which is designed to protect waters against pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. I expect to be in a position to submit a final version of the programme to the European Commission shortly. The programme is due to come into effect on 1 January 2006.</P>
        <P>The Water Services Bill 2003 which has been passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann and is awaiting scheduling for Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann contains a number of provisions to address or facilitate source protection of water supplies. The Bill provides that it will be an offence to cause water in a waterworks, including streams, wells and reservoirs, to become polluted. The Bill also places an obligation on occupiers of premises to ensure that drains and treatment systems, including septic tanks, are maintained in such condition as to ensure that they do not cause a risk to human health or the environment.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 77, 118 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>The European Environmental Agency, EEA, report, Annual European Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990-2003 and Inventory Report 2005, published on 21 June 2005, collates latest available greenhouse gas emissions figures from all EU member states. Collectively, emissions of all greenhouse gases rose by 1.5% from 2002 to 2003 across the 25 member states and by 1.3% for the EU 15. Among the EU 15, Ireland is one of only two member states to have achieved reductions in its emissions over this period.</P>
        <P>Greenhouse gas emissions figures for Ireland are compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency and published in an annual national inventory report. The latest available figures for Ireland are for 2003 and show overall emissions to be 66.57 million tonnes CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> equivalent. This figure is equivalent to approximately 25% above 1990 levels. According to the EEA report, this is equivalent to a year on year reduction of 2.6%, showing that progress is being made towards the 13% target. The decline in Ireland has been due to a number of factors, including the closure of the IFI fertiliser plant, increased use of cleaner fuels in electricity production and continued decreases in emissions from the agriculture sector.</P>
        <P>The national climate change strategy identifies a range of policies and measures to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions across various sectors in the most efficient and equitable manner. In addition to the policies and measures set out in the strategy, progress towards meeting Ireland&rsquo;s Kyoto target will also be achieved through emissions reductions by installations participating in the EU emissions trading scheme which was not yet in place during the period covered by the EEA report and through Government purchase of allowances.</P>
        <P>Work is in progress in my Department on a review of the national climate change strategy, taking account of developments since its publication in 2000. A key purpose of this review will be to ensure the adequacy of existing measures and the development, where appropriate, of additional measures. While my Department has overall responsibility for the strategy, it is a matter for Departments with direct responsibility <Col N="571"/>for each sector identified in the strategy to implement the optimum mix of policies and measures to control and reduce Ireland&rsquo;s overall level of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 125 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Research Board report was commissioned as a literature review which is a recognised research tool. This is particularly so where original research is precluded, as in this case by the absence in Ireland of facilities for the thermal treatment of municipal waste.</P>
        <P>My response to the report was put on hold to allow regard to be had to other and more recent research findings in detailed consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the Environmental Protection Agency. Specifically, close regard was had to a UK Government report <Col N="572"/>on a review of environmental and health effects of waste Management, 2004, which extended the analysis to the impact of facilities based on the latest thermal treatment and landfill technologies, and to a discussion paper prepared by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.

	<P>The employment of staff is a matter for each local authority. It is open to the authorities to provide short-term summer employment for students. Such employment could meet relevant requirements of the local government sector, as well as offering work experience of benefit to the students concerned. The cost of any such summer employment would be met from the authorities&rsquo; own resources and from other income received, including general purpose grants from the local government fund.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 778 together.</P>
        <P>Following the recommendation of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, in its September 2000 report, a scheme of performance related awards was introduced in the local authority sector for managers, assistant managers and directors of services, commencing with the calendar year 2003. The operation of the scheme is monitored by a committee for performance awards, the specific functions of which are to: validate objectives established for managers, assistant managers and directors of services of local authorities; review self-assessments of performance by managers; decide on performance related payments for managers; approve recommendations made by managers for performance related payments to grades other than managers.</P>
        <P>The committee&rsquo;s report on the operation of the scheme for 2003, including an outline of the requirements in regard to objectives and performance, is available on the website of my Department at <i>www.environ.ie</i>. A copy of the 2003 report has also been sent to the Oireachtas Library. The 2004 report will be available shortly.</P>
        <P>Information naming officials and the individual amounts paid to them is deemed a personal record and, consequently, is not publicly available. However, the overall pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for the grades concerned and, within the overall limit, individuals may receive payments of up to 20% of pay. In a separate initiative introduced in 2004, performance across local government against a series of 42 service indicators will be published annually and I expect to have the first report, for 2004, <Col N="574"/>from the Local Government Management Services Board within the next month.</P>

On completion of the pilot phase this year, I will review the situation and consider the question of extending the competition.</P>

These are: 2000/53/EC &mdash; end-of-life vehicles: this directive was due for transposition by 21 April 2002 with obligations imposed under the directive effective in respect of new vehicles sold after 1 July 2002 from that date and from 1 January 2007 for all other vehicles &mdash; it is anticipated that this directive will be fully transposed in 2005; 2002/49/EC &mdash; assessment and manage<Col N="575"/>ment of environmental noise: drafting of regulations to transpose this directive which was due for transposition by 18 July 2004 is well advanced and transposition is intended during this summer; 2002/88/EC &mdash; measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery and 2004/26/EC &mdash; amending directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to emissions from internal combustion engines in non-mobile road machinery: draft regulations transposing both directives are nearing completion with a view to transposition during this summer &mdash; the first directive was due for transposition by 11 August 2004 and the second by 20 May 2005; 2002/95/EC and 2002/96/EC, with its amending directive 2003/108/EC: these two related directives deal, respectively, with restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and arrangements for dealing with waste electrical and electronic equipment and were due for transposition by 13 August 2004 &mdash; they will be fully transposed before 13 August 2005 when the take-back of electrical and electronic waste will become operable; and 2003/4/EC &mdash; public access to environmental information, repealing directive 90/313/EEC: legislative proposals for the transposition of this directive are in drafting. The directive was due for transposition <Col N="576"/>by 14 February 2005. It is intended that it will be transposed by the end of the year.</P>

        <P FLI="0">While this is a small survey, with estimated returns, it is indicative of the substantial numbers of child care facilities and places being provided through the planning process in accordance with the guidelines.</P>
        <P>It is regarded as good practice for ministerial guidelines to be reviewed after they have been in operation for a number of years. When that review takes place, the views of planning authorities and other stakeholders on the effectiveness of the guidelines will be sought in a more structured way. In the meantime, the possibility of collecting more complete statistics on the number of child care facilities and places for which planning permission is being granted will be examined, in consultation with the Local Government Computer Services Board.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Local authorities have a role in controlling emissions to air and water. With regard to emissions to air, under the Air Pollution Act 1987, primary responsibility for monitoring air quality, as well as the nature, extent and effects of emissions, rests with local authorities. Statutory responsibility for the enforcement of the Act is vested in local authorities which are empowered to require measures <Col N="577"/>to be taken to prevent or limit air pollution. They may direct a person on whom notice is served to take such measures as may be specified to prevent or limit air pollution.</P>
        <P>With regard to emissions to water, local authorities, as statutory pollution control authorities, have a key role to play in protecting water resources. The necessary powers to fulfil these responsibilities are provided for in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990 &mdash; the principal legal framework for the prevention of water pollution. Local authorities which license point sources, other than those licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency, can attach specific pollution conditions in licensing effluent discharges to waters or sewers from industry.</P>
        <P>All appropriate conditions for environmental protection, monitoring and so forth are attached to licences, including emission limit values, ELVs, and minimum standards. ELVs are set at a level which provides a high level of environmental protection and which complies with European Community legislation, where relevant.</P>
        <P>The Water Quality (Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2001 provide that licences granted by the Environmental Protection Agency or local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977, the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 or the Waste Management Act 1996 must reflect the prescribed standards. The standards had immediate effect, as and from 1 July 2001, for new licence applications. Existing licences had to be reviewed and, where necessary, revised to meet the prescribed standards within five years of that date. The regulations place an onus on the Environmental Protection Agency and on local authorities to ensure that the standards are complied with by 31 December 2010 and that, where the existing condition of waters does not meet a particular standard, there is no disimprovement in water quality in the meantime.</P>
        <P>The role of local authorities on climate change is set out in chapter 10 of the national climate change strategy, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 111 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; that is, manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics, silage bale wrap and sheeting are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The farm plastics recovery scheme operated by the Irish farm films producers group, IFFPG, is the sole &ldquo;approved body&rdquo; in Ireland at present for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for farm plastics waste and has operated successfully to date, funding the collection and recycling of 9,000 tonnes of farm plastics in 2004, representing in excess of 50% of farm plastics placed on the market during that year. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of this collection service over the course of 2004.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply an environmental protection contribution, EPC, levy on the sale of farm plastics which, in turn, is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and the rate of EPC levy applied is set by the company to ensure that its operational costs are covered. Manufacturers and importers who do not participate in the approved scheme, that is, self-compliers, are required under the regulations to operate a deposit and refund scheme, equating to a deposit-refund of &euro;254 per tonne of farm plastic purchased-returned, for the collection and recovery of waste plastics, as well as comply with other onerous reporting requirements to local authorities.</P>
        <P>The acceptance of inorganic farm waste at civic amenity sites is a matter for the individual local authorities engaged in the operation and management of these sites and for private operators also directly involved in the provision of such services. In broad terms, civic amenity sites are provided by local authorities to enable householders to bring a wide range of recyclable waste arising in the domestic sector for reception, storage and onward transfer to appropriate processing facilities. These recycling centres are not intended for general use by the commercial, industrial, construction or agricultural sectors. Responsibility <Col N="579"/>for waste management in these sectors rests with the individual firms concerned and must be carried out in accordance with their legal obligations under the Waste Management Acts 1996-2003 and regulations made thereunder.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the above, in light of the consistent and steady progress achieved by IFFPG since its inception, I am anxious to build on the success of the farm plastics scheme. In this context, I recently announced, in conjunction with the IFFPG, the launch of a feasibility study and pilot scheme to extend the operation of the scheme to recover other waste materials arising on farms such as fertiliser bags and used chemical containers that require environmentally sound and cost effective recovery outlets.</P>

	<P>Under the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities must prepare housing strategies which take account of existing and likely future needs for housing. Any development plan made by a planning authority must include a housing strategy for the area of the development plan.</P>
        <P>In exercising these functions it is a matter for each planning authority to ensure that provision is made in its area for an adequate supply of land for residential development in line with the assessment of needs in the housing strategy. Ensuring such supply requires, <i>inter alia</i>, the strategic reservation of land by planning authorities through the development plan process, coupled with ensuring timely and sequential release of land.</P>
        <P>The evaluation considerations set out on page 103 of the national spatial strategy which was prepared by my Department relate to housing location in urban areas. These considerations were incorporated in the national spatial strategy for the purposes of assisting planning authorities in exercising their function of identifying the most appropriate locations for land for residential development in and adjacent to urban areas. The identification of these locations is a matter for the relevant planning authority and my Department has no function in the matter.</P>
        <P>When a development plan has been prepared, the relevant planning authority is required to send my Department notification of this and a copy of the draft development plan. On examining the draft plan my Department may furnish comments, as appropriate, for consideration by the planning authority. In my Department&rsquo;s consideration of any development plan the matters considered are necessarily of a broad strategic nature such as whether the plan is consistent with the national spatial strategy and relevant regional planning guidelines and whether the statutory requirements with regard to the preparation and making of such plans have been complied with.</P>

        <P>To date no households have transferred to the scheme. The lead authorities, Dublin, Limerick and Galway City Councils, South Dublin, Offaly, Westmeath and Donegal County Councils and Drogheda Borough Council, are scheduled to commence the transfer of households from July. All other authorities are due to commence operation of the scheme before the end of the year. The transfer of 5,000 households remains the target for 2005 but the achievement of this target depends on the response from landlords and the voluntary-co-operative housing sector to the scheme. First indications are that the response is generally positive. My Department will closely monitor progress in the scheme in the coming months.</P>

The policy framework also reaffirms the prohibition on charging for domestic water services provided under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. In the absence of water charges for domestic consumers, the costs of domestic water services are met from public funds, with capital costs met through my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme and operational costs funded through the local government fund.</P>

	<P>It is a matter for the relevant individual local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement to investigate any instances or reports of illegal disposal of waste and consider appropriate action in such cases. While I have no direct function in regard to these matters, I have recently issued a policy direction under section 60 of the Waste Management Act which <i>inter alia</i> seeks to bring a greater focus to local authority enforcement activity. I intend that the policy direction will facilitate a more uniform and consistent approach to waste enforcement and that this will be reflected in increased and more effective enforcement actions.</P>
        <P>The Office of Environmental Enforcement supervises the environmental protection activities of the local authorities, through auditing their performance, providing advice and guidance and, in appropriate cases, giving binding directions. In this regard, the office is a resource for members of the public who have exhausted other avenues of complaint.

	<P>Public private partnerships, PPPs, represent an important additional procurement option for local authorities in providing important infrastructure in areas such as water, wastewater, waste and housing. To date, more than 100 PPP projects, with an estimated capital cost of &euro;2.1 billion, have been completed or are at various stages of progress in the local government sector. Most of these projects are in the water and wastewater sector and are being provided with funding from my Department on the basis of design, build and operate contracts.</P>
        <P>This type of PPP has made a significant contribution to meeting the requirements of the urban wastewater and drinking water directives as well as meeting the needs of an expanding population <Col N="584"/>and economy. Dublin Bay wastewater and Cork, Limerick and Wexford main drainage projects are among the major projects which have been completed. Other significant PPP projects which are at various stages of the process include major housing regeneration projects at Fatima Mansions and O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens in Dublin city, affordable housing initiative projects at Infirmary Road and Jamestown Road in Dublin city and the Dublin thermal treatment-waste to energy project. More than 70 further potential PPP projects are being investigated.</P>
        <P>A second measure of success for my Department&rsquo;s PPP programme is the amount of private finance which is coming forward which, depending on the results of tendering processes still under way, is estimated to fall within a range of &euro;550 million to &euro;700 million. Both the progress illustrated above across a diverse range of projects, together with the significant level of private financing being harnessed, indicate that my Department&rsquo;s PPP programme is performing effectively.</P>
        <P>My Department which is represented on the interdepartmental and informal advisory PPP groups chaired by the Department of Finance is working in these fora to improve the PPP process. In particular, it is hoped to reduce the complexity and costs of the process, with a view to increasing the number of projects and enhancing the speed and efficiency with which they can be delivered.</P>

	<P>While the concept of site value taxation has been raised in other contexts, it has not previously been considered as a viable alternative to commercial rates. Independent consultants were engaged by my Department last year to carry out a wide ranging review of local government financing. The consultants are assessing,<i> inter alia</i>, the totality of local authorities&rsquo; current funding requirements to 2010, the extent to which improved or alternative funding options may be required and, if so, they are to carry out an in depth examination of these options. I will consider the consultancy recommendations when the report is submitted to me shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 and 779 together.</P>
        <P>The most recent triennial statutory assessment of need took place in March 2005. This assessment is intended to be the most rigorous to date as it requires local authorities to collect detailed data on all households on the waiting lists. For the first time, an IT framework has been developed which will enable my Department to analyse data in respect of all households in much greater depth. The procedure involves each local authority transmitting its assessment results in an IT format to the Local Government Computer Services Board. Following a detailed validation process, the results are then collated centrally in a database.</P>
        <P>The Department is maintaining continuous contact with local authorities to ensure that their returns are submitted as soon as possible. To date, approximately 20% of local authorities have already submitted their returns and the remainder are currently in the process of finalising them. It is anticipated that the results will be published in September this year.</P>
        <P>The frequency with which needs assessments are conducted will be kept under review following the outcome of the current assessment.</P>

	<P>As part of a programme of further assessment, testing and <Col N="586"/>validation of the electronic voting and counting system, tenders have been sought from suitably qualified consultants to undertake a security and risk assessment of all aspects of the system and to devise a programme of additional testing. This work is intended to address issues raised by the commission on electronic voting and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately. The test programme will include both functional testing and technical analysis of the system components.</P>
        <P>The closing date for receipt of tenders was 21 June 2005. The tenders received are being assessed and a decision in this regard will be made as soon as possible. In these circumstances, it is not yet possible to specify the cost involved. While it is my intention that the overall work programme on the electronic voting system will be advanced as rapidly as possible, I am not in a position to specify the precise duration of the planned consultancy work at this stage.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Government has responded actively to increased levels of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output. In the current year, the Government is allocating record levels of funding to local authorities for their social and affordable housing programmes. The total Exchequer capital and current funding available for social and affordable housing in 2005 will amount to &euro;1.3 billion, which represents an increase of 20% on 2004. Total capital spending on social and affordable housing output in 2005, inclusive of non-Exchequer financing, will amount to almost &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>To ensure a systematic and integrated approach to the use of these resources, local authorities have, at my Department&rsquo;s request, developed new five-year action plans for social and affordable housing. The preparation of these plans will sharpen the identification of priority needs, and help to ensure a more coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including those to be provided by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. My Department is giving strong encouragement to local authorities to press ahead with the implementation of these action plans which are being underpinned by very substantial levels of Government funding. To underpin the multi-annual approach in the action plans, I have secured financial envelopes for the next five years.</P>
        <P>The capital allocation of &euro;841 million, which has been provided for the construction of local authority housing in 2005, an increase of &euro;100 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation, will support the commencement of the construction of 6,000 new units by local authorities and the achievement of some 5,500 completions. In addition, house completions by the voluntary and co-operative sector is expected to be some 1,800 units this year.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, the needs of almost 59,000 households have been met, taking account of local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under both social and affordable housing measures. Overall, in 2005 it is anticipated that the needs of in excess of 13,000 households will be met through the same measures. In addition, it is anticipated that a number of households currently in private rented accommodation will transfer to the new rental accommodation scheme now being introduced. <Col N="588"/>These households will continue to be mainly accommodated within the private rented sector.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the possibility that Ireland may be in breach of the habitats directive unless a comprehensive national hare survey is undertaken; and if, in the meantime, he will cease licensing the capture of wild hares for any purpose, including coursing.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish hare (Lepus timidus hibernicus) is listed on Annex V of the EU habitats directive in addition to being protected under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000. The directive provides that if member states deem it necessary, in the light of surveillance of Annex V species, they shall take measures to ensure the taking in the wild of specimens of such species as well as their exploitation is compatible with their being maintained at a favourable conservation status.</P>
        <P>A steering group drawn from my Department and from the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland has drafted an all-Ireland species action plan for the Irish hare. The draft plan was made available in March 2005 for public consultation, which has now been completed. The plan is expected to be finalised by autumn 2005. A scientific survey to estimate hare populations in Ireland is one of the strategies proposed in the draft action plan and a tendering process for the carrying out of a national survey for this purpose is already in progress. The licensing provisions of the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 are designed to regulate the taking of wildlife at sustainable levels. In the case of hares, the principal factor determining population levels in the Republic of <Col N="589"/>Ireland, is believed by ecologists to be land management practice, weather conditions and the availability of suitable habitat. The annual capture under licence of some 5,000-6,000 hares for coursing, the great majority of which are subsequently released, is not considered to be a significant factor in the overall conservation status of the Irish hare.</P>
        <P>If it is concluded, in the light of results of the planned national survey of hares, that further measures are necessary for the protection of the species, they will be taken, in accordance with regulation 24 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which transposes the relevant provision of the habitats directive. My Department is at present carrying out its yearly review of the conditions applying to the licence under section 34(3)<i>(b)</i> of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, for the netting of hares for coursing.</P>

The data will allow for comparisons between different time periods. NIRSA is now preparing a series of maps with supporting text and tables.

	<P>My Department has been included in the first tranche of public bodies required to produce an Irish language scheme under the Official Languages Act 2003. Our scheme, which has been recently approved by the Minister for Community, Rural and<?oasys _jy?>Gaeltacht Affairs, will take effect from August 2005.</P>
        <P>Specific costs incurred by my Department in the implementation of the Act to date amount to &euro;11,277 in respect of the publication of notices under section 13 of the Act. My Department&rsquo;s Estimates for 2005 do not separately identify a cost for implementing the provisions of the Act. Any additional costs arising with translation of material, publication of documents, or advertising, etc. as set out in the Department&rsquo;s scheme will be met from within the overall administrative budget of the Department or the budget for individual projects and programmes.</P>
        <P>Prior to the enactment of the legislation, my Department was already making available Irish versions of publications such as the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy and annual report, and providing replies to correspondence in the language in which it was received. Accordingly, the Act in these areas involves no extra costs for my Department. Any costs incurred by agencies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for those agencies and accordingly details of such costs are not available in my Department.</P>

	<P>The housing management initiatives grant scheme was established in 1995 to fund innovative and practical pilot projects designed to improve the performance by local authorities &mdash; and latterly, other bodies with housing functions &mdash; of their housing management functions. The grants cover 90% of staff costs and 50% of administrative costs, with the balance being met by the recipient. Some 323 projects were approved under the scheme, and grants of some &euro;4.9 million paid, over the period 1995-2004. I recently approved further grants totalling &euro;1.96 million in respect of 78 projects throughout the country. Details of these approvals are set out in the following table.</P><Col N="593"/><Col N="594" />

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The World Health Organisation, WHO, has recently announced the launch of an international radon project which it will coordinate and which is aimed at helping countries reduce the health risks associated with radon gas.</P>
        <P>The project, which is initially expected to run for three years, 2005-07, will seek to identify <Col N="597"/>effective strategies for reducing the health impact of radon, promote sound policy options for radon prevention and radon mitigation programmes for national authorities, and increase public and political awareness about the consequences of exposure to radon. Under the project, a global network of radon scientists, regulators and policy makers will be established to collaborate in the project. The first meeting of the project was held in Geneva in January 2005 to develop the strategy for the project.</P>
        <P>Ireland, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, will actively participate in this project. The institute, which participated in the January 2005 meeting, has been highlighting public awareness of radon in Ireland for many years and has been actively encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes measured for radon and to carry out radon remediation works where concentrations above the national reference level are found.</P>
        <P>I regard this project as a very welcome and positive initiative and look forward to the recommendations arising from it in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 789 together.</P>
        <P>My Department does not employ the services of modelling agencies. A number of consultancy firms are utilised from time to time to promote awareness of issues relating to my Department&rsquo;s functions. Invitations to tender would require the successful firms to implement high-impact awareness campaigns, including a national campaign launch, information leaflets, design, printing and dissemination of posters, instructional videos, local and national advertising or general media briefing. Subject only to general guidance from my Department, the format of public information campaigns and the manner in which they are conducted are matters for the selected firms. Any costs incurred by agencies under the aegis of my Department is a matter for those agencies and <Col N="598"/>accordingly details of such costs are not available in my Department.</P>

        <Quest>the measures he intends to take in relation to littering in urban areas following the classification of almost half the towns in the Irish business against litter survey as either having a serious litter problem or as being a litter black spot; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary responsibility for developing and implementing responses to the litter problem lies with local authorities. My Department provides financial support for a programme of anti-litter initiatives to support action against litter including the national spring clean campaign, the Irish business against litter, IBAL, national litter league and the development of the national litter pollution monitoring system.</P>
        <P>Identification of areas with litter difficulties is an important first step in addressing the problem. The IBAL league is a valuable initiative in this context. In addition, under the national litter pollution monitoring system local authorities carry out surveys to determine the extent and composition of litter pollution in their functional areas. The data provided from the surveys enable each local authority to assess the effectiveness of its litter management strategies on an ongoing basis and ensure the optimum allocation of its resources to tackle litter.</P>
        <P>Existing anti-litter actions by local authorities, together with my Department&rsquo;s support for the above initiatives, provide an effective and appropriate basis for tackling litter pollution generally, including problems associated with litter blackspots.</P>

	<P>The report of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings recommended that, in the first instance, the British Government should be pursued bilaterally on issues that are still outstanding. As Deputies know, I have been pressing the British Government for a response. As recently as yesterday, it was raised at the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, where I <Col N="600"/>met Prime Minister Blair. I reiterated the call by the Oireachtas Committee for a &ldquo;Cory&rdquo; type inquiry and I indicated that, in the absence of progress, the Irish Government would examine the possibility of pursuing a case before the European Court of Human Rights, as recommended by the Oireachtas committee. The British side contend that they can find no evidence on collusion in the bombings but undertook to take another look at any information available. I indicated that, in the meantime, I would be raising the matter on a preliminary basis with the Attorney General.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the reason the Food Safety Authority of Ireland has not yet published its completed audit of the labelling and traceability structures as currently operate across Ireland&rsquo;s food industry; the date when this research will be published; if her attention has further been drawn to the main findings of this audit and its recom<Col N="612"/>mendations; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[21886/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Food businesses are required to manage food safety proactively and a traceability system is an essential element of a food safety management system as it provides a means by which a food company can track and trace any foodstuff that is suspect or unsafe.</P>
        <P>In July 2002, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland produced a detailed guidance note on recall and traceability which was developed by the authority in collaboration with the enforcement agencies, the food industry and the food and drinks federation of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC. This note aimed to clarify and standardise procedures for the identification and removal of unsafe foodstuffs from the food chain.</P>
        <P>Under recent EU legislation, food operators must have a traceability system in place. This requirement is contained in Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No. 178/2002 of 28 January 2002. This regulation, which is applicable from 1 January 2005, requires that food and feed business operators shall be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food, a feed, a food producing animal or any substance intended to be, expected to be incorporated into a food or feed &mdash; to achieve this operators shall have in place systems and procedures which allow for this information to be made available to the competent authorities on demand &mdash; and shall have in place systems and procedures to identify the other businesses to which their products have been supplied, this information shall be made available to the competent authorities on demand.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the FSAI undertook an audit intended to establish if operators in the fish, beef and poultry industries had in place a system of product traceability and recall. The audit also examined compliance with general labelling requirements &mdash; with particular reference to country of origin declarations.</P>
        <P>In the course of the audit some 90 businesses, including some in the service and retail sectors, were visited. The findings indicated that trace<Col N="613"/>ability systems need improvement. Each proprietor was furnished with an inspector&rsquo;s report, which was also made available to the official agencies.</P>
        <P>Given the small scale of the 2004 audit, it was not the intention of the FSAI to publish a report. However, the FSAI intends conducting a wider audit in conjunction with the official agencies, now that traceability is a legal requirement and will publish a comprehensive report in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159, 160, 181 to 183, inclusive, and 254 to 261, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have seen the report which the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned from Dr. Ronnie Pollock. The report reviewed existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards and concluded that the services available for persons with cystic fibrosis in this country are not of the standard that they should be.</P>
        <P>The report provides an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients. It makes recommendations with regard to the numbers and categories of staff that are appropriate for a modern, multi-disciplinary cystic fibrosis service. Following publication of the report, the Health Service Executive, HSE, at the request of the Cystic Fibrosis Association, established a working group to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland, both in hospitals and in the community. The working group is also to make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services.</P>
        <P>The working group is multi-disciplinary in its composition and includes representation from the Cystic Fibrosis Association. It held its first meeting in early April and I understand it hopes to complete its work over the next few months. The Pollock report is one of a number of reports relating to cystic fibrosis services being considered by the group. The work of the group will result in an agreed proposal for the development and reconfiguration of services for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland. The funding and implementation of the services will be a matter for the HSE.</P>
        <P>I will be glad to meet with the Cystic Fibrosis Association and the HSE to discuss the develop<Col N="617"/>ment and reconfiguration of services for persons with cystic fibrosis when the working group has finalised its proposals.</P>
        <P>In regard to the services for cystic fibrosis patients at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, I understand the HSE has made some additional funding available to the hospital to implement short-term measures to alleviate some of the pressures, including the provision of additional staff and additional space.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to making the full range of cancer services available and accessible to cancer patients throughout Ireland. To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s policy on radiation oncology is based on the report on The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. It is important to build teams of highly expert clinicians working together to deliver top quality cancer care, including radiotherapy, to cancer patients. The Government is, therefore, determined to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards.</P>
        <P>The immediate developments in Cork and Galway have resulted in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. Two additional linear accelerators are being provided at the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital, CUH. The first of these linear accelerators was fully commissioned in March and the second is expected to be commissioned by the autumn. Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at CUH with sessional commitments to the south-eastern and the mid-western areas.</P>
        <P>Patients in the north-west are being referred for radiation oncology treatment to the recently commissioned radiation oncology department at University College Hospital Galway, UCHG, and also to St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital Dublin. A consultant radiation oncologist with significant sessional commitments to the north-western area has recently been appointed to UCHG.</P>
        <P>I will meet the Minister for Health for Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, shortly and I have asked that North-South co-operation on cancer services be put on the agenda. Discussions are on-going between the HSE and Belfast City Hospital in regard to access to radiation oncology services for patients in the North-West. My Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the Health Service Executive to advise the Deputy of progress on these discussions. The state of the art facility at Belfast City Hospital is scheduled to open in early 2006. The Government is as committed to delivering safe and effective cancer services for people of the north-west as we are for people in every region.</P>

It is understood that the HSE has now made available application forms for the GP visit card. The HSE has placed advertisements providing details of the application process in the national press and intends to place further advertisements in the regional press over the coming week. Those who are eligible will be able to visit their general practitioner without charge, and receive general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme. Eligibility to GP visit cards will be determined, by the Health Service Executive, following an assessment of the income of the applicant, and spouse, if any, after tax and PRSI have been deducted. Provision for the allowance of reasonable expenses in respect of child care, rent-mortgage and commuting to work expenses has also been included.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In 2005, additional funding of &euro;60 million has been provided to allow the Health Service Executive, HSE, provide an additional 30,000 people with full medical cards and to extend free access to general practitioner services under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to up to a further 200,000 persons. The reason for this initiative was to ensure that as many people as possible, partic<Col N="621"/>ularly those on low income and families with children, would be free from the worry of costs associated with accessing general practitioner services for themselves and their children.</P>
        <P>It is understood that the HSE has now made available application forms for the GP visit card. The HSE has placed advertisements providing details of the application process in the national press and intend to place further advertisements in the regional press over the coming week. Those who are eligible will be able to visit their general practitioner without charge, and receive general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme. Eligibility to GP visit cards will be determined, by the Health Service Executive, following an assessment of the income of the applicant, and spouse, if any, after tax and PRSI have been deducted. Provision for the allowance of reasonable expenses in respect of child care, mortgage and commuting to work expenses has also been included.</P>

	<P>The registration of nurses is the statutory responsibility of An Bord &Aacute;ltranais. I am informed that the registration section of the board is processing increased volumes of applications for registration, mainly from non-EU applicants applying through nursing recruitment agencies contracted by the health services to recruit nurses.</P>
        <P>The board is working closely with the nursing recruitment agencies and with the Health Service Executive and the nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention national project to ensure that all applications for registration are processed in an efficient and timely manner, and ensuring that each applicant meets requirements and standards for registration. Nursing agencies receive weekly reports updating on the progress of applications through the registration process and every assistance is given to agencies in regard to registration requirements to guide them in the recruitment process.</P>
        <P>An Bord &Aacute;ltranais is a regulatory body, and there is no statutory requirement for the Minister to hold a formal meeting with the board. However my Department will request regular updates from the board on this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 175, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, signed the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations, 2005 on 14 June 2005, and these regulations reinstate charges for inpatient services. Section 53 of the Health Act, 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides,<i> inter alia,</i> for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In this regard, charging for patients in long-term care cannot commence until the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed, which means that the earliest date on which charges can be levied is 14 July 2005.</P>
        <P>These regulations provide for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 defines inpatient services as meaning &ldquo;institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto.&rdquo;</P><Col N="623"/>
        <P>The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied. Class 1 &mdash; class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;120 or the weekly income of that person less &euro;35, whichever is the lesser; and class 2 &mdash; class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of &euro;90, or the weekly income of that person less &euro;55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</P>
        <P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded long-term residential care. All those who were charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years ago. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the CPI, since the time the person involved was charged. Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme.</P>
        <P>The practice of charging or seeking a contribution from patients-clients who have income has been a feature of the health service for a number of years. This is consistent with the principle that where individuals are in a position to contribute a modest amount to the cost of their care, it is reasonable that they do so.</P>

	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. The determination of eligibility of applications for medical cards is statutorily vested in the Health Service Executive. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer, or a delegated officer, will have regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant, and spouse, if any. Recent changes announced by the Health Service Executive will mean that household income, after deductions in respect of PRSI and tax have been made, will be assessed when determining eligibility. Provision will also be made for reasonable expenses in respect of child care, rent-mortgage and commuting to work expenses.</P>
        <P>Medical cards may be made available by the Health Service Executive where guidelines are exceeded in circumstances, for example, where there is particular need for medical services. A medical card may be issued to all or some members of a family. However, in all cases, the decision is a matter for the Health Service Executive. In assessing a person&rsquo;s eligibility, every aspect of an individual&rsquo;s financial means and medical expenses are carefully examined to ensure that no financial hardship is caused by the executive&rsquo;s refusal to grant a medical card in any particular case.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The reduction in numbers can be explained by a number of factors including the changed economic circumstances of the population. These changed circumstances have meant that many people are no longer eligible for a medical card <Col N="628"/>on means grounds. The ongoing management and review of medical card databases by the Health Service Executive has also been a factor, with normal deletions being made to databases due to death, change in eligibility status or persons moving from one area to another.</P>

	<P>The health care assistant or HCA grade supports the work of nurses-midwives and acts under their supervision. Health care assistants and similar grades such as nurse&rsquo;s aide and ward attendant have been a feature of the Irish <Col N="629"/>health service for some time. In recent years there has been investment in the upskilling of these grades so that they can play a greater role in the delivery of care and allow nurses to concentrate on more high level work appropriate to their education and training.</P>
        <P>Section 23 of Sustaining Progress includes a commitment to the implementation of improved skill mix in the health service. There is a recognition of the need to mainstream existing developments including greater use of health care assistants. The report of the Commission on Nursing, 1998, made recommendations in paragraphs 4.55 and 7.63 regarding the scope for increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of non-nursing tasks. Specifically, paragraph 7.63 recommended that a group be established to &ldquo;examine opportunities for the increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of other non-nursing tasks&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>A group was established to examine the effective utilisation of professional skills of nurses and midwives and issued its report in May 2001. The group recommended that the grade of health care assistant-maternity health care assistant be introduced as a member of the health care team to assist and support the nursing and midwifery function. It also made recommendations related to the education and training of health care assistants including that the health care support certificate, FETAC (NCVA, Level 2) qualification be the preparation required for employment as a health care assistant.</P>
        <P>Health care assistants are now integrated into many health care teams. In 2003, 513 health care assistants undertook the health care support certificate. During 2004-05, more than 900 health care assistants undertook the health care support certificate. In addition, health care assistants have been introduced in eight pilot sites in the mental health services and they are undertaking the health care support certificate. The pilot programme in mental health services is currently being evaluated.</P>
        <P>This vocational education programme has enhanced the skills and competency levels of health care assistants. As a result, health care organisations are increasingly recognising the potential of health care assistants and have requested further development of their role. It is intended that the training of health care assistants be enhanced to include the taking and reporting of vital signs. This was recently the subject of an industrial relations dispute with the Irish Nurses Organisation but following the intervention of the national implementation body it was recommended that there be immediate and full co-operation with all of the preparation and training arrangements necessary for the introduction of the programme at the earliest possible date. A process is now in place to deal with the issues in relation to implementation of this programme.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that operational issues in relation to the services provided by acute hospitals now rest with the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired Infections, including drug-resistant organisms such as MRSA. Improving the standards of cleanliness in hospitals is a priority. One of the specific actions identified in the ten-point plan to improve the delivery of accident and emergency services refers to the need to address this particular issue.</P>
        <P>The national hospitals office has engaged external consultants to carry out an independent hygiene audit of hospitals this summer. The results of the audit will be made public and are expected to inform the national standards for infection control and cleaning. A SARI infection control sub-committee has updated the 1995 national guidelines for the control and prevention of MRSA in hospitals and in the community. The key recommendations cover such areas as <Col N="631"/>environmental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These guidelines are expected to be published shortly.</P>

	<P>In 2004 there were 31,727 re-admissions to hospital within one week of discharge. This figure is derived from the hospital inpatient inquiry or HIPE system which gives details of activity in all publicly funded acute hospitals in the state as well as in two private hospitals. HIPE data only allows the identification of a re-admission if it is to the same hospital as the original admission. The figure given includes all inpatient re-admissions, i.e. re-admissions for the same condition, for an unrelated condition and planned re-admissions, and excludes day cases. It should be noted that the HIPE database for 2004 has not yet been finalised and hospital discharges occurring during 2004 are still being added to the system.</P>

	<P>Fluoridation of public water supplies as a public health measure is accepted as being one of the most effective methods of ensuring against tooth decay. The World Health Organisation, WHO, recommends fluoridation of public water supplies and has stated that &ldquo;fluoridation of water supplies, where possible, is the most effective public health measure for the prevention of dental decay&rdquo;. The WHO has also <Col N="634"/>stated that &ldquo;people of all ages, including the elderly, benefit from community water fluoridation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The recently completed survey of oral health, covering the island of Ireland, shows that fluoridation of public water supplies continues to be a highly effective public health measure. It has contributed significantly to a major reduction in the incidence of dental decay in the Republic.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a forum on fluoridation was established to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum report&rsquo;s main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. In all, the report of the forum on fluoridation made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, policy and technical aspects of fluoridation and the establishment of an expert body to oversee the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
        <P>The Irish expert body on fluorides and health held its inaugural meeting in April 2004. The terms of reference of the expert body are: to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the forum on fluoridation; to advise the Minister and evaluate ongoing research &mdash; including new emerging issues &mdash; on all aspects of fluoride and its delivery methods as an established health technology and as required; and to report to the Minister on matters of concern at his/her request or on its own initiative.</P>
        <P>The expert body has broad representation, including from the areas of public health medicine, engineering, management, environmental protection, environmental health, dentistry, and health promotion. The body has a strong consumer input in terms of members of the public and representatives of consumer interests, in addition to the necessary scientific, managerial and public health inputs. The expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride in the future.</P>

	<P>Government investment and support has ensured rapid progress in implementing the recommendations of the report of the Commission on Nursing. This commitment by Government has transformed nursing in Ireland over the last decade. The commission examined and made recommendations on areas such as the evolving role of nurses and midwives, promotional opportunities and the training and educational requirements of nurses.</P>
        <P>The change in pre-registration nurse education has been the most significant development on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing. Nurse training has moved from a three year diploma to a four year degree programme and there is now an annual intake of 1,640 students, an increase of 70% on the 1998 numbers. The Government has provided capital funding of &euro;240 million for 13 new schools of nursing in the universities and institutes of technology. The annual revenue cost of the degree programme is in excess of &euro;90 million. The first group of students on this programme will graduate in autumn 2006.</P>
        <P>A major recommendation of the commission was that a clinical career pathway be developed in addition to the managerial and educational pathways already open to nurses. It also recommended that an independent statutory agency be established with responsibility for post-registration professional development of nursing and midwifery. The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery was established in 1999. The council has responsibility for setting criteria and approving posts at clinical nurse specialist, CNS, and advanced nurse <Col N="636"/>practitioner, ANP level. My Department is providing funding of &euro;4.22 million to the council this year. To date the council has approved 1,674 CNS posts and 24 ANP posts.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Nursing made a number of important recommendations in relation to the role of nurses and midwives in the management of services. These recommendations have been implemented. Developments in this area include the development of the post of chief nursing officer in the Department of Health and Children; the establishment of eight nursing and midwifery planning and development units; and the introduction of new nurse management structures. The number of management positions in nursing has significantly increased since the publication of the report of the Commission on Nursing. The number of assistant directors of nursing, for example, has increased by 140% between 1997 and 2004.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Nursing made recommendations in paragraphs 4.55 and 7.63 regarding the scope for increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of non-nursing tasks. Specifically, paragraph 7.63 recommended that a group be established to &ldquo;examine opportunities for the increased use of care assistants and other non-nursing personnel in the performance of other non-nursing tasks&rdquo;. On foot of these recommendations it has been agreed that the healthcare support certificate, FETAC (NCVA, Level 2) qualification be the preparation required for employment as a health care assistant.</P>
        <P>Health care assistants are now integrated into many health care teams. In 2003, 513 health care assistants undertook the healthcare support certificate. During 2004/2005, over 900 health care assistants undertook the healthcare support certificate. In addition, health care assistants have been introduced in eight pilot sites in the mental health services and they are undertaking the healthcare support certificate. Healthcare organisations are increasingly recognising the potential of health care assistants and have requested further development of their role.</P>
        <P>In the area of nursing in the community, the commission recommended that midwifery should no longer be a mandatory requirement for public health nurses. An Bord Altranais approved this rule change in November 2004 and I gave my approval as required under Section 26 of the Nurses Act 1985 in December 2004. Work is continuing in my Department of a strategy for nursing and midwifery in the community, or NAMIC.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Nursing recommended a number of amendments to the Nurses Act 1985. My Department is currently involved in drafting new legislation which will amend that Act. The new legislation will modernise the regulatory framework operated by An Bord Altranais for nurses and midwives. Work on the draft heads of the Bill is at an advanced stage and all stake<Col N="637"/>holders will have an opportunity to comment on the draft legislation.</P>
        <P>The commission made over 100 main recommendations. Work is ongoing on some of these recommendations including the preparation of the new Nurses Bill and NAMIC. The commission also made a recommendation in relation to care of the older person. This is clearly an issue related to service provision rather than nursing <i>per se</i>. Care of the older person is a key service area and one about which I have particular concerns. I will be deciding how best to proceed on this front shortly.</P>

	<P>Three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year, one of which is a two year postgraduate course at the University of Limerick. In total, these courses provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers has been identified in the report commissioned by my Department from Dr. Peter Bacon and associates on current and future demand conditions in the labour market for certain professional therapists as sufficient to meet the long-term requirements for speech and language therapists in Ireland. The first graduates of the new speech and language therapy course in the University of Limerick will be conferred in the near future.</P>
        <P>Intensive efforts have been made to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy in recent years. The success of these measures has resulted in an increase of 99 speech and language therapists, in wholetime equivalent terms, in the public health service from 399 WTEs at end-2001 to 498 WTEs at end-2004. This represents an increase of 25% in the number of speech and language therapists employed over the three year period.</P>
        <P>Measures that have contributed to increased staffing levels in speech and language therapy include new pay scales and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development, the availability of the fast track working visa scheme and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. These measures are also designed to help sustain the improvements achieved in staffing levels.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, carers provide an invaluable role in supporting family members in the community and it is important to recognise their contribution to society. The role of carers in society has to some extent not been fully recognised in the past but this situation is changing with a number of initiatives being introduced to address the needs of carers.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children provided in excess of &euro;1 million in funding in 2005 to a number of groups supporting cares such as Care Alliance, Caring for Carers and the Carers Association. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has also implemented a range of measures, since 1999, to assist carers, including increases in the carer&rsquo;s allowance, the introduction of an annual payment of &euro;1,000 towards the cost of respite care and the extension of schemes such as the free electricity allowance, free telephone rental and free TV licence to those on carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees in Ireland to leave their employment temporarily for a minimum period of 13 weeks up to a maximum period of 65 weeks to provide full-time care and attention. Carer's leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer's Leave Act ensures that those who propose to avail of carer&rsquo;s leave will have their jobs kept open for them for the duration of the leave. The above mentioned initiatives demonstrate this Government&rsquo;s commitment to addressing the shortcomings identified by the Carers Association and other groups regarding support for carers.</P>

	<P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the nursing homes regulations 1993 provide for the payment of subvention for private nursing home care for applicants who qualify on both medical and means grounds. Under the regulations, the Health Service Executive when considering an application for subvention carries out a means test which takes into account the means of the applicant and his or her spouse-cohabiting partner, where appropriate, and the assets of the applicant. The means test is usually carried out by the local community welfare officer and involves looking at the applicant&rsquo;s <Col N="641"/>income for the previous 12 months. Income from all sources is taken into account, including wages, salary, pension, allowances, payments for part-time and seasonal work, income from rentals, investments and savings and all contributions from all sources. Income is assessed net of PRSI, income tax and the health contribution and the income of a married or cohabiting person is taken to be half the total income of the couple. In assessing an applicant&rsquo;s assets the first &euro;7,618 of such assets is disregarded.</P>
        <P>If the value of the applicant&rsquo;s principal residence is in excess of &euro;95,230 and the residence is not occupied by a spouse, a son or daughter aged less than 21 or in full-time education or a relative in receipt of the disabled person&rsquo;s maintenance allowance, blind person&rsquo;s pension, disability benefit, invalidity pension or old age non-contributory pension, then the HSE imputes an annual income equivalent to 5% of the estimated market value of the principal residence. If an applicant&rsquo;s spouse is still resident in their home at the time of application, then that house may not be assessed for subvention purposes.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long-stay charges. All those who were illegally charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The repayment will apply to all those who were charged including those in receipt of payments other than the non-contributory old age pension.</P>
        <P>The scheme will not provide for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years ago. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of <Col N="642"/>inflation, using the CPI, since the time the person involved was charged. Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas as soon as possible to provide a clear legal framework for the scheme.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>The national helpline set up by the Health Service Executive to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate, but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme. Any person who considers that they or a family member may be eligible for repayment may register their interest in advance with the Health Service Executive, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, County Offaly; or e-mail to <i>refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie;</i> or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for standards for orthodontic treatment is statutorily vested in the Dental Council under the Dentists Act, 1985, Part II, Section 6(1). The Dental Council was established to &ldquo;promote high standards of professional education and professional conduct among dentists&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In recent years there have been several reviews of the orthodontic service. Formed at the invitation of the Department, a group representative of health board management and consultant orthodontists reviewed the orthodontic service and produced a report in 1998 called the Moran report. The objective of this review was to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards. Furthermore, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, JOCHC, also carried out a review of orthodontic services which culminated in the publication of its report, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland, in 2002. This was followed by a further review by the health board chief executive <Col N="643"/>officers of the orthodontic service to consider the JOCHC&rsquo;s report and assess progress with implementing the Moran report. Finally, just this month, the JOCHC published a follow up to its 2002 report on the orthodontic service in Ireland.</P>
        <P>All these reviews have examined, in depth, the orthodontic service and none has raised the issue of standards.</P>

        <P>A new national cancer strategy is currently being finalised by the national cancer forum, a multi-disciplinary group of experts in oncology. As part of this work, the forum has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The forum has also developed criteria against which all future screening programmes will be assessed.</P>
        <P>With regard to screening for prostate cancer, I understand that the forum will recommend that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country. This issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised control trials currently being conducted internationally. This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocate the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for healthcare resources. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer.</P>
        <P>Appropriate treatment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer is available at major hospitals throughout the country. Any man who has concerns in relation to prostate cancer should contact his GP who will, where appropriate, refer him to the appropriate services in his area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 270 together.</P>
        <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme, LTI. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, Parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. There are currently no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.</P>
        <P>The medical card, GMS, and drugs payment, DPS, schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme, DPS. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. There is a range of asthma products, such as inhalers, on the common list of reimbursable drug products for the GMS and DPS.</P>
        <P>Decisions on individual eligibility for a medical card are solely a matter for the Health Service Executive. In determining eligibility, for people other than those aged over 70, the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances are considered and income guidelines are used. However, where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be granted if it is considered that medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. There are currently no plans to change this position.</P>
        <P>In November 2004, I announced revised medical card income guidelines, which increased by 7.5%, together with significant rises in respect of dependants, with a view to extending the number of medical cards by 30,000 in 2005. These guidelines have been in operation since January 2005. The introduction of the GP visit card will extend eligibility for a patient holding such a card to general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme. Such a person&rsquo;s income can be up to 25% in excess of the income guidelines used for the assessment of eligibility for medical <Col N="653"/>cards. In addition, the basis for assessing an applicant&rsquo;s income has been changed to a disposable income basis, that is income after tax and PSRI, including allowance for childcare, rent or mortgage and the cost of travel to work. This will mean that more individuals and families will be eligible, the assessment process will be fairer and more user-friendly and administrative arrangements will be simplified and streamlined.</P>

	<P>The recent report by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, JOCHC, is a follow up to its earlier report of 2002, The Orthodontic Service in Ireland. As the committee makes clear, the report should be read as an appendix to the 2002 report.</P>
        <P>A number of measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the orthodontic service. My Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, are currently funding 13 dentists from various HSE areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 dentists are in addition to the nine dentists who successfully completed their training and have taken up duties with the HSE. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics for the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. My Department has given approval in principle to a proposal to further substantially improve training facilities for orthodontics at the school, which will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>
        <P>My Department has been informed by the HSE that at the end of the March 2005 quarter, there were 22,818 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the public orthodontic service. This means that there are over twice as many patients getting orthodontic treatment as there are waiting to be treated and more than 7,000 extra patients <Col N="654"/>are getting treatment from the HSE since the end of the June 2001 quarter. My Department has written to the HSE regarding the latest JOCHC report and will meet it to discuss the recommendations made in the report.</P>

The commission has recently readvertised the panels for the tribunal clerks, and interviews will be held in the near future.</P>
        <P>Interviews for the panels of consultant psychiatrists were held in May and June of this year and these are currently being processed. The Irish Hospital Consultants&rsquo; Association has advised its members not to apply for membership of the panels and this has led to an insufficient number of applications.

        <Quest>the action she intends to take to correct the monopoly in the dental profession for which the Dental Act 1985 was drawn up and the Dental Council set up; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dentists Act, 1985 provides that the Dental Council may with the consent of the Minister for Health make schemes for the establishment of classes of auxiliary dental workers. This is in line with one of two options presented in the Restrictive Practices Commission report, that the general provision on the carrying-on of dentistry by a non-dentist should not apply to the provision of dentures by a denturist. The Act does not give the Minister power to amend a scheme proposed by the Dental Council.</P>
        <P>Over the last number of years, the Dental Council has proposed schemes to establish a denturist class of auxiliary dental worker, but the Minister has not consented to such schemes in the absence of a grandfathering clause enabling existing denturists to continue to practice. This issue has been the subject of High Court proceedings which have supported the position of the Minister for Health and which are now the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>The Dentists Act 1985, provides for 19 members to be appointed to the Dental Council. Of these, two are appointed by University <Col N="656"/>College Cork, two are appointed by the University of Dublin, one is appointed by the Royal College of Surgeons, seven are dentists, to be elected by fully registered dentists, two are appointed by the Medical Council, one is appointed by the Minister for Education and four are appointed by the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The Dentists Act does not stipulate whether nominees other than the seven registered dentists specifically mentioned should or should not come from the dental profession. The four members of the current Dental Council appointed by the Minister for Health and Children are a consultant orthodontist, a consultant microbiologist, a dental technician and the Director of Consumer Affairs. While the Dental Council consists of members from backgrounds including dentistry, administration, psychology and paediatrics, it remains the case that a majority of those on the council are from the dental profession.</P>

	<P>Persons who suffer from diabetes are covered under the long-term illness scheme for the provision of all approved prescribed medicines for the treatment of that disease, free of charge. I have no plans to change the conditions of the long-term illness scheme to include the provision of general practitioner services free of charge, to persons who suffer from diabetes.</P>
        <P>There is strong evidence that early diagnosis of diabetes and proper management by a multidisciplinary team, including general practitioners, improves the health of diabetics and postpones the onset of serious eye, kidney and cardiovascular complications. These complications such as blindness, coronary artery disease, kidney failure and amputations ordinarily have to be managed in hospital.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in 2005, additional funding of &euro;60 million has been provided to allow the Health Service Executive provide an additional 30,000 people with full medical cards and to extend free access to general practitioner services under the general medical services (GMS) scheme to up to a further 200,000 persons. The reason for this initiative was to ensure that as many people as possible, particularly those on low income and with children, would be free from the worry of costs associated with accessing general practitioner services for themselves and their children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The national breast screening programme commenced in 2000 and covers the eastern, midland, north-eastern and parts of the south-eastern regions of the country. Screening is being offered free of charge, every two years to approximately 160,000 women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age. The current priority of BreastCheck and my Department is to progress the roll out of breast screening to a further 130,000 women in the same age group in the remaining regions of the country.</P>
        <P>New facilities for the national expansion of BreastCheck are included in the health capital investment framework 2005-09. My Department recently gave approval to BreastCheck to advertise for the appointment of a design team to work up detailed plans for the design and construction of the clinical unit at University College Hospital, Galway. The selection process for the design team is well advanced. BreastCheck anticipates that the shortlisting, interviews and fee negotiations will be complete by the end of July 2005. Discussions on staffing requirements are currently taking place involving BreastCheck, the Health Service Executive and my Department. I am confident that the target date of 2007 for the commencement of the national roll-out will be met.</P>
        <P>Following the national roll out and when the programme is sufficiently developed and quality assured, consideration will be given to extending <Col N="661"/>the upper age limit. There is no evidence of the value of population based breast screening programmes for women under 50 years of age and there are no plans to extend the programme to this age group.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This position is consistent with the recommendations adopted by the European Union which advocates the introduction of cancer screening programmes which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources. The proposals do not provide specific recommendations for screening for breast disease for those under 50 years of age.</P>
        <P>Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</P>

	<P>As set out in my reply to the Deputy on this issue on 14 June, the Government decided in September 2004 not to introduce a carbon energy tax. A lot of work went into examining how a carbon energy tax could be implemented and its likely effects in environmental, economic and social terms. In this respect, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the non-tax measures under the national <Col N="664"/>climate change strategy, for the following reasons. First, the Government concluded that the environmental benefits of such a tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases.</P>
        <P>Second, in considering the introduction of such a tax, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received. Over half of those who expressed a view on the carbon tax were against it including a number of significant representative bodies. Even some of those who had no difficulty with a carbon tax in principle sought exemptions for various sectors and purposes.</P>

	<P>Appointments to boards of State bodies are, in the first instance, subject to the relevant legislation governing the establishment of the bodies in question. Generally, appointments to the boards of State bodies are made by the relevant Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. I can assure the Deputy that, as Minister for Finance, I would expect that all such appointments would meet the very highest standards of general suitability and of probity. If the Deputy is referring to a specific case, or cases, the issue should be raised with the relevant Minister, or Ministers, in the first instance.</P>

	<P>There are 36 national monument sites in the care of the Office of Public Works in County Clare. Responsibility for the management of these sites transferred to the Office of Public Works on 1 January 2004.</P>
        <P>The primary source of funding for conservation projects at national monument sites is the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The programme of works and funding under the NDP was agreed in 2000 and work has continued in the intervening period on implementing this. The following table outlines expenditure under the NDP on conservation work at sites in County Clare from 2000 to 2004.</P><Col N="665"/>

        <P FLI="0">While there is no guide service at Poulnabrone Dolmen, it is estimated that the site attracts well in excess of 100,000 visitors per annum, making it the most visited of the heritage sites in County Clare in the care of the Office of Public Works.</P>
        <P>Heritage sites managed by the Office of Public Works are not promoted individually. Such sites <Col N="666"/>are promoted collectively nationally and regionally in conjunction with the regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development. National and regional versions of brochures are distributed at staffed OPW-managed heritage sites and through the tourist information offices network operated by the regional tourist authorities. The sites are, in addition, promoted through a website, <i>www.heritageireland.ie.</i> It is not possible, therefore, to separately quantify the expenditure on the marketing of individual heritage sites in County Clare.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s taxation policy is designed at max<Col N="667"/>imising the employment and economic benefits of industrial development by creating an attractive climate for investment throughout Ireland. In this respect Ireland offers one of the most beneficial corporate tax environments in the EU with a corporation tax rate of 12.5% applying since 1 January 2003.</P>
        <P>This is a general measure which applies across the board to companies located in all areas and regions in the State. As such, it does not conflict with EU state aid rules. A proposal to offer tax incentives to companies in a specific region or specific towns would constitute state aid and would have to be examined and approved by the EU Commission. Recent experience of a much more rigorous examination of fiscal state aids by the Commission indicates that approval for any such scheme could not be guaranteed given in particular that the current regional aid map for Ireland expires at end of 2006.</P>
        <P>There is no tax free status available to firms in Shannon, Cork or Dublin. However, an effective corporation tax rate of 10% does apply to certain companies in the Shannon Airport zone and the IFSC and manufacturing companies generally. State aid rules require this rate to be phased out and not re-introduced. Specific incentives as provided for in Finance Act 1997 concerning Cork Airport business park, were approved by the European Commission under state aid rules and applied to buildings where expenditure was incurred before end-December 2000.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 288 and 289 together.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s views that first-time buyers are being penalised by an ever increasing burden of taxation nor are they been ripped off by increased taxation. The policies pursued by this Government have ensured that the income tax burden has fallen for all categories of income earner since 1997. In 1997 the entry point to taxation for a single PAYE person was under &euro;98 per week. Today it is &euro;274 per week &mdash; an increase of almost 180%. In 2005, a person on the average industrial wage will have seen their pay rise by over &euro;11,000 since 1997, but their tax bill cut by over &euro;200 per annum as compared to then. This reduction in personal taxation means that individuals retain more of what they earn to spend as they see fit.</P><Col N="668"/>
        <P>With regard to specific tax measures in the housing area it should be borne in mind that the housing market is a complex and dynamic one and demands continuous monitoring and adjustment to address changing circumstances. To this end, a number of measures that have improved the position of first time buyers in the housing market have been introduced over the years. In budget 2003 the higher ceilings for first-time buyers on allowable interest for mortgage interest relief were increased from &euro;3,175 to &euro;4,000 per annum for a single person and from &euro;6,350 to &euro;8,000 for a married couple and the period for which these increased ceilings apply was extended from five to seven years. Most recently, in budget 2005, I introduced a stamp duty relieving measure for first-time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses by increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold for such purchasers from &euro;190,500 to &euro;317,500 and by reducing rates for house values up to &euro;635,000.</P>
        <P>Government policy in the housing market has focused, among other things, on improving supply, assisting home ownership particularly for first-time buyers, facilitating the expansion of the private rented sector and promoting the regeneration of certain areas. In this context, a range of tax incentives exist in relation to the housing market in the case of first-time buyers and other owner-occupiers, for tenants and investors. The years 2003 and 2004 were the ninth and tenth successive years of record housing output with 68,819 and 76,954 completions respectively. The rate of house building is now more than double that in 1996. Our tax policy has had some success but we don&rsquo;t claim all the credit.</P>
        <P>Like all other goods and services, the State finds it necessary to raise taxes from this area. However, there has been some badly informed commentary recently in relation to the tax take from new homes. Figures in excess of 40% have been attributed to the amount that the Government raises in tax from each new home. However, this figure is wrong. In fact, the cost of a new home that accrues directly to the Exchequer through taxation is more like 28%, based on both Dublin and national prices. This is broadly in line with the tax take on the overall economy.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has decided to establish, a new agency &mdash; the Affordable Homes Partnership &mdash; to drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area. The agency will be focused on early improvements in the delivery of affordable housing. The agency&rsquo;s first tasks will include helping to accelerate the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative on State lands. The agency will also issue a call for proposals from third parties in order to identify further appropriate sites for affordable housing. Furthermore, the agency will provide a co-ordinated public information service on the various aspects of affordable housing, thus making it easier for <Col N="669"/>people to find out what is on offer and how to avail of it.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 231 of 30 November 2004, if he will introduce roll over relief on capital gains tax for landowners who have had their lands purchased for road construction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>As previously advised to the Deputy in a reply to a parliamentary question on 30 November 2004, capital gains tax is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT now applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order.</P>
        <P>It was announced in the 2003 budget that no roll-over relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement.</P>
        <P>The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. In budget 1998, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought CGT into line with other areas.</P>

	<P>The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &mdash; the financial regulator &mdash; is currently studying the situation with regard to endowment loan shortfalls, having commenced a survey last year, to determine whether and to what extent there will be difficulties for customers. It would be inappropriate to reach any conclusions in this issue in advance of IFSRA&rsquo;s consideration of the matter. The authority&rsquo;s consumer director has encouraged people to come forward if they are concerned about the possibility of having been mis-<Col N="673"/>sold an endowment mortgage. The financial regulator has emphasised the importance of bringing complaints in the first instance to the financial institution from which they bought the policy.</P>
        <P>The recently appointed Financial Services Ombudsman, whose office became operational on 1 April this year, is statutorily independent and is empowered to deal with complaints from customers of financial service providers. As stated by the Deputy, the ombudsman can deal with complaints related to conduct occurring up to six years before the complaint was made.</P>
        <P>In addition, under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004, a provision exists for consumers to make complaints if the latest occurrence of the conduct being complained about happened within the last six years.</P>
        <P>Consistent with the approach adopted in the Pensions Ombudsman scheme, it was considered essential to insert a retrospection limit on the investigation of complaints by the Financial Services Ombudsman. It would not be practical for the ombudsman to be asked to investigate complaints into conduct that occurred many years previously. In addition, while there is a time limit on the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the financial regulator can examine conduct which occurred before the six year period.</P>
        <P>It is important to bear in mind also that while the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Acts 2003 and 2004 provided for the roles of both the regulator and the ombudsman scheme concerning complaints about financial institutions, there was no diminution in the right of the consumer to have recourse to legal action through the courts.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is on emergency tax as there is no record that Revenue was notified of the person&rsquo;s employment, either by the person himself or his employer. The position has now been clarified by Revenue and a certificate of tax credits issued, dated 24 June 2005. This will regularise his income tax affairs.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As can be inferred from this table, Ireland has contributed some &euro;9.7 billion to the EU budget from 1995 to 2004. During this same period, Ireland received over &euro;27 billion in transfers, giving a net benefit of some &euro;17.3 billion. The table also illustrates that despite Ireland&rsquo;s receipts remaining reasonably static at around &euro;2.7billion per annum, Irish payments to the EU budget have almost doubled over the same period.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s future net position will obviously depend on the outcome of the current negotiations on the financial perspective for the EU budget for the period 2007-13. However, it can be expected that our payments to the EU budget will continue to rise while our receipts will reduce in future years, reflecting our strong economic growth which has resulted in our becoming one of the more prosperous member states of the Union.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Residential property tax, RPT, was abolished with effect from 5 April 1997. However, any person who had a liability to RPT prior to its abolition in 1997 has an obligation to discharge that liability, including the payment of interest.</P>
        <P>A liability to RPT is not a charge on a property, except where a person &mdash; transferor &mdash; transfers a residential property to his or her spouse. In such cases, where a transferor transfers a residential property to his or her spouse, any tax and interest due and outstanding on the date of such transfer shall be and remain, for 12 years from that date, a first charge on that property.</P>
        <P>Where a property is sold for a consideration in excess of the RPT threshold the vendor must furnish an RPT clearance certificate to the purchaser to certify that the vendor does not have an outstanding RPT liability. The value threshold for this purpose is &euro;1,300,000 and applies to house sale contracts on or after 5 April 2005. Where the vendor fails to furnish the purchaser with an RPT clearance the purchaser must deduct a specified amount from the sale consideration and remit the specified amount to the Revenue Commissioners. The specified amount is calculated by deducting the amount of the RPT threshold from the sale consideration and multiplying the answer by 1.5%.</P>
        <P>Where a person requests a clearance certificate from Revenue and has not previously paid RPT, Revenue will issue a multi-year return form to that person, and the form must be returned to Revenue with payment of any outstanding tax and interest. Where a person has paid RPT previously and requests a clearance certificate from Revenue, and Revenue consider that the RPT has been underpaid for any year(s), an assessment will issue for the amount of the underpayment.</P>
        <P>Interest has been applied to late payments of RPT, however, surcharges do not apply to outstanding RPT liabilities.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of VAT collected from house purchases cannot be identified in the overall yield of VAT as the information furnished on VAT returns does not require this to be identified. However, based on data published by the Department of <Col N="676"/>the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the VAT yield from the sale of new houses, including apartments, is estimated as &euro;1,100 million in 2002, &euro;1,541 million in 2003 and &euro;1,999 million in 2004.</P>
        <P>The reduced VAT rate of 12.5% was increased to 13.5% on 1 January 2003. Had the reduced VAT rate remained unchanged it is estimated that the VAT yield would have been &euro;96 million less in 2003 and &euro;148 million less in 2004. The estimated increase in the overall VAT yield from all sectors to the Exchequer arising from the increase in the reduced rate was &euro;239 million in 2003 and &euro;330 million in 2004. This is, therefore, an important source of funding for public services.</P>

	<P>All owner-occupiers are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 square metres or less. As the Deputy will be aware, the 2005 budget introduced a stamp duty relieving measure for first-time house purchasers who are owner-occupiers of second-hand houses by increasing the stamp duty exemption threshold for such purchasers from &euro;190,500 to &euro;317,500 and by reducing rates for house values up to &euro;635,000.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated cost of abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers who are owner-occupiers of residential property up to &euro;400,000 is approximately &euro;14 million in a full year.</P>

	<P>Traders making supplies in the State are obliged to register for VAT where certain turnover thresholds are exceeded or are likely to be exceeded in any continuous period of 12 months. The current thresholds which were enacted by the Finance Act 1994 with effect from 1 July 1994 are: &euro;25,500 in the case of a person supplying services &mdash; this threshold also applies to persons supplying a combination of goods and services or goods chargeable at the 13.5% or 21% VAT rates which are produced from zero-rated materials; and &euro;51,000 for persons supplying goods. Businesses with turnover below these thresholds can register for VAT and those in the service sector in particular frequently choose to do so for business reasons.</P><Col N="677"/>
        <P>As regards the estimated cost of doubling the current thresholds, the position is that under the EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply member states may only increase thresholds in line with inflation. However, if thresholds were increased in line with the consumer price index since 1994, the &euro;25,500 threshold would need to be increased to &euro;34,910 and the &euro;51,000 threshold would need to be increased to &euro;69,819. The costs involved would be &euro;19 million and &euro;45 million respectively, amounting to a total cost of &euro;64 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>It is not customary for me to comment on any possible changes to thresholds which may or may not arise in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the VRT4, Rev 6, form is a declaration for first registration of a used vehicle and the RF100 form is an application to the motor tax authorities &mdash; local authorities &mdash; for first licensing of a used vehicle. Prior to March 2005, the VRT4 and the RF100 were printed as one carbonised set, with the <Col N="678"/>VRT4 the top page and the RF100 the bottom page. The information applicable to both documents copied through from the VRT4 to the RF100. Changes made to the RF100 form by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, requesting additional information, led to the misalignment of the two forms and made the existing carbonised document obsolete.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners are actively engaging with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with a view to synchronising the data and producing a carbonised version of the revised forms. This form would then be made available to motor dealers.</P>

	<P>The EU savings directive was transposed into Irish law by the Finance Act 2004. The purpose of the directive is to ensure that individuals resident in an EU member state who receive savings income from a paying agent in another member state are taxed in the member state in which they are resident for tax purposes. To this end, the directive provides for most EU member states to automatically exchange information on the cross-border payment of interest to individuals resident in another member state.</P>
        <P>Three member states &mdash; Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg &mdash; have chosen not to introduce a reporting system and will impose a withholding tax on such interest payments instead. The directive does not introduce any change to the declaration and payment of tax in Ireland by individuals. However, the information exchanged will enable the tax authorities in the member state in which the recipient is resident to ensure that he or she has declared that income for tax purposes.</P>
        <P>The savings tax scheme also extends to ten dependent and associated territories of the UK and the Netherlands, namely, Aruba, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Montserrat, the Netherlands Antilles, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Moreover, the EU has entered into agreements with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and Switzerland under which these countries will both apply a withhold<Col N="681"/>ing tax on interest payments to residents of EU member states and will also exchange information on request with EU member states on tax fraud. The legislation applies to payments of interest made on or after 1 July 2005. In order to make the report, Irish paying agents &mdash; generally financial institutions and other persons who make interest payments in the course of their business &mdash; must establish the identity and residence of their customers who are individuals and report details to the Revenue Commissioners of interest payments made to those individuals who are resident in another EU state. The Revenue Commissioners, in turn, are authorised to forward the information returned to the appropriate member states in which the individuals are resident.</P>
        <P>The obligation to collect information on the identity and country of residence of customers in accordance with the rules set out in the directive applied from 1 January 2004. As regards customers where the relationship was established before that date, paying agents must establish the identity and country of residence of such customers using whatever information is in their possession at that time. First reports from paying agents to the Revenue Commissioners are due by 31 March 2006. These reports will cover interest payments made in the period 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2005. Thereafter, the reports will be due annually by 31 March of the year following the year in which the payments are made.</P>
        <P>It is expected that most paying agents will make returns electronically via the Revenue on-line system, ROS. To this end, the Revenue Commissioners have developed free software to prepare and manage returns. This software will be available towards the end of July 2005 using the ROS link on the Revenue web site <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. A paper version of the return will also be available for those paying agents who may not have the technological capability to make electronic returns.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have been proactive in publicising the new requirements from the outset. Consultations with the financial services industry and other interested parties regarding the implementation of the directive commenced in 2003 and are ongoing. Industry organisations which have been consulted include the Irish Bankers Federation, An Post, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Manage<Col N="682"/>ment Agency, the Dublin Funds Industry Association, the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Irish Taxation Institute, the Irish Stock Exchange, and the Irish Association of Investment Managers.</P>
        <P>Guidelines on the operation of the legislation have been drawn up in consultation with the financial institutions and other organisations mentioned above. The guidelines were circulated and revised as appropriate to take on board industry views and concerns. The first working draft of the savings directive guidelines was drawn up in November 2003 and the guidelines were published on the Revenue website in June 2004. These guidelines will be revised as and when issues arise during the implementation phase.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also supplied material on the savings directive for inclusion in the<i> Incorporated Law Society Journal </i>and will shortly be publishing an article in <i>Tax Briefing</i>, a Revenue publication circulated to accountants and other tax professionals. The commissioners will also issue a notice early next year &mdash; probably by newspaper advertisement &mdash; reminding paying agents of the obligation to submit a return by 31 March 2006.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a similar question on 17 February 2004 in respect of the years 1999 to 2003, a copy of which I have forwarded to him. I propose to provide the additional details requested by the Deputy in respect of 1998, 2004 and 2005 to date.</P>
        <P>My Department had spending on reports, consultancies and other advisory or PR commissions as mentioned by the Deputy in each of the years in question. The NDP-CSF unit which operates under the aegis of my Department also had such spending, but a breakdown of that spending is only available by project.</P>
        <P>The total in respect of each of the years in question for my Department, and the total for the NDP-CSF unit, are shown in the following summary table:</P><Col N="681"/>

        </table><Col N="693"/>
        <P FLI="0">Overall progress on delivering the NDP has been improving with some &euro;36.2 billion of expenditure incurred nationally at the end of December 2004. This compares with &euro;28 billion of expenditure at the end of December 2003. With respect to expenditure in the BMW region, total expenditure reported to the NDP-CSF monitoring committee amounted to some &euro;9.6 billion or 76% of profiled expenditure for the period January 2000 to December 2004. In 2004 just over &euro;1 billion was spent on the key economic and social infrastructure programme in the BMW region. This represented 96% of projected expenditure for the year 2004 with total expenditure at nearly 90% of projected levels for the period January 2000 to December 2004. In the national roads programme, &euro;168 million more was spent in the BMW region in 2004 than in 2003. This attests to the continued significant improvement in investment in the region. In the housing programme, expenditure in the BMW region from January 2000 to December 2004 reached 120% of projected expenditure for the period. Expenditure on the health programme over the same period amounted to 99% of forecast.</P>
        <P>With respect to the performance of the productive sector operational programme, expenditure is considerably behind the original targets set in 1999 in both regions due to a combination of factors. Demand for some of the schemes under this programme and the level of funding expected from the private sector did not materialise as initially anticipated. The original expenditure forecasts and the regional breakdown of this expenditure were set at unrealistic levels in the light of activity in the area since the NDP was launched in 1999.</P>
        <P>Performance of both regional operational programmes remains disappointing due mainly to the lack of demand for a range of schemes, particularly in the agriculture sector, and the lateness of some measures to begin spending. Good progress is evident with respect to expenditure on local infrastructure, microenterprise support and social inclusion. Expenditure on the employment and human resource development operational programme is broadly consistent in both regions with performance in both regions close to 95% of the original expenditure targets for the period 2000 to 2004.</P>
        <P>European Structural Funds are profiled to ensure consistency with the EU budget commitments of such funds to each operational programme for each year of the NDP. However, expenditure under the EU-funded elements of the operational programmes will continue until the end of 2008. Therefore, expenditure which will occur in the years 2007 and 2008 must be considered when viewing the rate of progress on the measures supported by the Structural Funds.</P>
        <P>The responsibility of my Department is to ensure that resources are made available to meet the Government&rsquo;s priorities and to secure full drawdown of Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of Structural <Col N="694"/>Funds. To date, the level of Exchequer resources made available under the NDP has been greater than originally profiled. It is my objective that as major projects are completed more funds will become available over the remainder of the NDP for investment in the BMW region so that progress can be made on rectifying the existing imbalance.</P>

The envelope provision is not broken down by region. I am not, therefore, in a position to say how much of it will be expended in the BMW region over the period from 2006. This is a matter for individual Ministers and Departments who generally have delegated sanction to approve projects within the overall programme amount as approved by Government. The Deputy may, therefore, wish to contact individual Departments for the information sought in the question.</P>
        <P>I have separately, in a reply to Question No. 316 from the Deputy, set out the estimated level of spend, to date, in the BMW region under the national development plan, 2000-06.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for the residential reliefs under any of the property based tax incentive schemes, where such relief is provided, it is necessary for the owner of <Col N="696"/>a qualifying property to have either a certificate of reasonable cost or a certificate of compliance. A certificate of reasonable cost is required where the builder or developer retains ownership. It certifies that the cost of providing the accommodation is reasonable, that the dwelling unit is within the specified floor area limits and that it complies with the standards as outlined in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government memorandum, HA1 &mdash; April 2004. In the case of refurbishment projects it also certifies that the work was necessary for the purposes of ensuring the suitability of the property as a dwelling.</P>
        <P>Certificates of compliance are required where the tax relief is being claimed by a person other than the developer, for example, by the purchaser of a property. This certifies that the accommodation is within the specified floor area limits and that it complies with the standards set out in these guidelines and the standards as outlined in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Memorandum, HA1 &mdash; April 2004. In the case of refurbishment projects, it also certifies that the work was necessary for ensuring the suitability of the property as a dwelling.</P>
        <P>As the processing of applications for both certificates falls under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, any inquiries as to the number of certificates issued for a specific geographical area and the type of expenditure in respect of which certificate relates should be addressed to that Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 and any regulations made under that Act are the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Statutory responsibility for occupational pensions scheme legislation rests with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The pensions board offers guidance as appropriate.</P>
        <P>My Department issued a circular 2/2003 dated 31 January 2003 to all Departments, which gave a summary of the main provisions of the Act as it applies to civil servants and notified Departments of their obligations under the legislation. In general, the Act provides that a part-time employee, as defined in the Act, cannot be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee regarding conditions of employment. However, regarding any pension scheme or arrangement these provisions do not apply to part-time employees who normally work less than 20% of the normal hours of comparable full-time employees.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Commission on Public Service Pensions considered, among <Col N="697"/>other things, possible improvements to pension arrangements for part-time public servants, particularly with regard to access to pension schemes and to the method of integration of occupational pensions with social insurance benefits. In his Budget Statement in December 2003, my predecessor announced that the Government had decided to implement the bulk of the recommendations of the commission.</P>
        <P>Discussions were subsequently held with the unions and in September 2004, following Government approval, the introduction of certain key recommendations, including a proposal for <i>pro rata</i> integration for the pensions of part-time staff, was announced. The effect of the change to <i>pro rata</i> integration will be that the occupational pensions of part-time public servants will be calculated on the basis of <i>pro rata</i> service and a notional full-time salary. This will result in an improved pension benefit for part-time public servants whose pensions are integrated with social welfare benefits, that is where the occupational pension is integrated with the old age contributory pension, OACP, to provide a combined pension. My Department is currently finalising a detailed circular on revised arrangements for part-time public servants to implement the new system. The opportunity is being taken in this circular to remind Departments once more of their obligations under the Act and of the need to comply with the provisions of the Act. The circular is at an advanced stage and it is intended to issue it in the near future.</P>

        <P>The day-to-day supervision of credit unions is a matter for the registrar of credit unions within the financial regulator.

        <Quest>the value to taxpayers in 2005 of the tax cuts introduced in the budgets of 1998, 1999 and 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume that the tax cuts to which the Deputy refers are those resulting from the personal tax packages introduced in the budgets for each of the years 1998 to 2000. It is very difficult to isolate the current value to taxpayers of those reliefs from the totality of very generous personal tax packages introduced in successive budgets in the period since 1998. Over that period, various measures impacting on personal taxation, including PRSI and levy changes, at a cost of &euro;6.3 billion on a full-year basis have been implemented. Of the total cost of &euro;6.3 billion, close to &euro;2.9 billion relates to the budget and post-budget measures introduced in 1998, 1999 and 2000. These amounts are in then money values. If these were shown in 2005 prices, their value would of course be greater.</P>
        <P>However, by way of illustration, since 1997 a person on the average industrial wage will have seen their annual pay rise by more than &euro;11,000 while paying more than &euro;200 per annum less in tax compared to 1997.</P>

	<P>The Irish economy is estimated to have grown by 3.7% in real terms in 2003, as measured by GDP and by 4.9% in 2004. In nominal terms, including the effects of price increases, GDP growth in 2003 is estimated at 5.3% and at 8.5 % in 2004. Finalised data for 2004 will not be available until sometime next month when the CSO release its 2004 national income and expenditure figures.

        <P>Tax revenues in 2003 increased by 7.6% over 2002 on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of tax receipts of a &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; nature. The underlying increase in 2004 was 11.1%.</P>
        <P>As regards the hypothetical scenario of lower economic growth in 2003 and 2004, I would point <Col N="699"/>out to the Deputy that tax revenue is dependent not only on the rate of economic growth but on the composition of that growth.

	<P>In my December budget my Department forecast that the Irish economy would grow by 5.1% in real terms in 2005, as measured by GDP. In nominal terms, including the effects of price increases, GDP is forecast to grow at 8.5%. An updated forecast of economic growth for 2005 will be included in the annual economic review and outlook, which will be published by my Department in August. On an underlying basis, that is excluding the impact of tax receipts of a once-off nature, tax revenues in 2005 were forecast in the budget to increase by 7.4% over 2004.</P>
        <P>Tax revenue is dependent not only on the rate of economic growth but also on the composition of that growth.

	<P>The ESRI SWITCH model was utilised by my Department to analyse the impact of the combined effect of the social welfare and tax changes contained in the budget for 2005 on the distribution of income. As set out in the budget documentation, the <Col N="700"/>model indicated that the most significant net income gains from budget 2005 accrued to those in the lowest income deciles.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Finance, my primary input in the area of income distribution arises from my responsibility for taxation policy. In that regard, the current established approach to taxation in Ireland, and in other OECD countries, is that while the tax system may have a role to play in the broader issue of income distribution and poverty reduction, taxation policy is not the main instrument for achieving objectives in this area. Instead, the social welfare system has the primary role in alleviating poverty and overall policy on social welfare and poverty alleviation, including the appropriate rates and consequent costs of social welfare payments, is, in the first instance, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

A married couple that has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</P>
        <P>The figures for 2005 are as estimated for budget 2005. The budget estimate is based on historical Revenue data for the short tax year, 2001, adjusted to take account of assumed growth in incomes and in the number of income earners to end 2005. The data refers to tax cases rather than individuals and includes both employees and the self-employed and those on other income such as, for example, pensioners. The data is provisional and subject to revision over time; the next revision to take account of actual data for the 2002 tax year is likely to be available during the second half of 2005.</P>
        <P>The effect of last December&rsquo;s budget has been to reduce the percentage of income earners estimated to be paying tax at the higher rate in 2005 from almost 36%, in the absence of the budget income tax measures, to approximately 33% when those measures are taken into account. The Deputy will be aware that major portion of avail<Col N="702"/>able resources in the budget was devoted to taking the then minimum wage annualised out of the tax net through increases in the employee and basic personal tax credits. The remaining resources were used mainly to widen the standard rate bands, thus ensuring that an additional 52,000 taxpayers will not pay tax at the higher rate in 2005. The budget also removed from the tax net 66,000 income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 2005.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital allowances are available for child care facilities since their introduction in Finance Act 1999. Under the normal self-assessment rules any person seeking to claim capital allowances in respect of a qualifying building would submit their claim on the appropriate tax return form. Claims for this relief are aggregated in tax returns with other claims, such as with industrial buildings allowances generally or with other capital allowances, and do not distinguish between the reliefs claimed in respect of child care facilities and those claimed in respect of other buildings qualifying for capital allowances. Consequently it is not possible for Revenue to indicate the level of uptake of the specific incentive relating to child care facilities.</P>
        <P>However, as part of ongoing commitments to improve the quality of information available on the costs of tax expenditures generally the Revenue Commissioners have introduced a number of changes to certain tax forms, which will yield additional information regarding the cost of reliefs. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 to underpin these changes. This will provide better data in this area and enable fuller estimates of the tax foregone to be made over time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Wild salmon stocks are under threat from a variety of adverse environmental and other pressures which impact on marine survival as well as in our rivers and estuaries. As Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I am fully aware that these pressures, <Col N="704"/>along with excessive exploitation of salmon stocks, pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this valuable resource.</P>
        <P>Since 2002, the Government has implemented a strategy to ensure, through progressive reductions in the commercial catch, that the conservation limits specified by the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission are being reached. This policy of promoting the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling has delivered significant overall catch reductions aimed at achieving the objective of restoration of salmon stocks.</P>
        <P>The central and regional fisheries boards devote considerable effort and resources, in collaboration with Tourism Ireland, to the promotion of angling abroad. I am advised that the overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003 observed a decline in activity holidays generally which is not confined to angling.</P>
        <P>The conservation measures which have been implemented to date on the recommendation of the National Salmon Commission deliver a practical mechanism to effect the protection of salmon stocks while acknowledging the important role angling plays in attracting tourists to Ireland. These measures, which are necessary to minimise the impact on our valuable wild salmon stocks, are aimed at providing an adequate season for tourism angling.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 and 339 together.</P>
        <P>The EC biofuels directive sets indicative targets of 2% market penetration for biofuels by end 2005. The targets in the directive are not mandatory. The directive required all member states to provide a report to the Commission last year and central to this report was the identification of a national target for market penetration of biofuels by end 2005. Many member states, including Ireland, indicated that they would not be in a position to meet the 2% target by the end of 2005. Ireland is starting from a very low current production base and the 2% target therefore represents a considerable challenge.</P>
        <P>Ireland has reported a target for market penetration of biofuels by the end of 2005 of 0.06%, increasing to 0.13% in 2006. The 2005 and 2006 targets are based on the anticipated outcome of the pilot biofuels mineral oil tax relief scheme under the Finance Act, which received state aids clearance in March 2005. The scheme was advertised as a competitive &ldquo;call for proposals&rdquo; on 20 April 2005 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 13 May 2005. The proposals received are being assessed by my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, and it is expected that recommendations will be made to the Department of Finance shortly. While the pace of progress in reaching Ireland&rsquo;s identified target is as anticipated, it is too early to give a <Col N="706"/>definitive position on levels of market penetration by the end of 2005.</P>
        <P>An interdepartmental biofuels group was established in 2004 to consider policy options for the development of the biofuels market and to consider these options from the perspectives of the sectors or interest represented by each Department. It comprised representatives from my Department, the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Finance, Transport, and Agriculture and Food, and SEI. Close contact with these Departments continues, as part of the policy development process.</P>
        <P>As part of its work, the group commissioned a &ldquo;Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland&rdquo;, which was published by SEI in December 2004. The report, which is available on the SEI website, examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel. The report is being considered as part of the overall policy objective to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland. The report suggests that excise relief is the most effective short-term measure to stimulate the market, but that other policy initiatives, such as a renewables obligation, might be more beneficial in the longer-term.</P>
        <P>The group is scheduled to meet again shortly, to consider terms of reference of a further study on biofuels policy implementation. This study will build on the findings of the &ldquo;Liquid Biofuels Strategy Study for Ireland&rdquo; and aims to examine in further detail the policy incentive options available to Government to stimulate increased deployment of liquid biofuels in the Irish transport fuel sector, and to provide a detailed path towards implementation of the most appropriate options.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no plans to introduce proposals to amend the existing legislative provisions, which prohibit political advertising on radio and television services. The ban on political advertising is contained in a short provision that also bans religious advertising along with advertising related to an industrial dispute. In 2003 my predecessor conducted a review of the ban on religious advertising and decided the ban should remain. Having regard to the potential intrusive nature of advertising on radio and television, which is different from other forms of advertising, it was considered that it was not desirable for individual groups to be in a posi<Col N="707"/>tion to buy air-time to deliver an unchallenged message that is aimed at influencing and altering behaviour in society in circumstances where it is difficult for the public to test or verify positions advanced. I am of the view that this line of argumentation is also valid in the case of political advertising. The report on the review of the ban on religious advertising is available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>Radio and television programmes offer many opportunities for those interested in politics to explore, question and debate issues that are important in Irish society. I believe that it is healthy that such discussions and debate should be conducted on our airwaves in an open and challenging fashion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by ESB National Grid that the capacity of the power system can be divided in terms of generation capacity and transmission capacity. The latest figures from ESB National Grid show there are 5,800 MW of generation capacity connected to the Irish power system. Peak demand in the coming winter is forecast to reach 4,600 MW. Generation capacity is shared by all customers nationwide and is not therefore divided by county. The ESB National Grid generation adequacy report set out when new generation will be needed, taking into account the availability of existing power stations and the ongoing increase in consumer demand. This report is published on ESB National Grid&rsquo;s website. I will forward a printed copy of the report to the Deputy for reference.</P>
        <P>Regarding transmission capacity, transmission lines and stations are constructed in order to meet ongoing demand growth, or when either a generator or large customer seeks a connection to the power system. ESB National Grid annually publishes details of where transmission capacity is available for large customers. Its forecast statement, which is also available from the website, provides details of the locations where capacity is available and the works that are planned to put this capacity in place. Again, I will forward a printed copy to the Deputy for reference.</P>
        <P>ESB National Grid has plans for &euro;700 million investment in new and upgraded high-voltage transmission infrastructure over the next five years. This investment will facilitate all customers, including large industries, power stations and wind farms.</P>

        <QRef>[22621/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware <Col N="712"/>of the report, finalised earlier this year, relating to peaking of world oil production, which was commissioned by the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the US Department of Energy. The purpose of this study was to identify the critical issues surrounding the occurrence and mitigation of global oil production peaking. Understandably, the focus of the report is primarily on the implications of oil peaking for the United States.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question as to when global oil production may peak, the report acknowledges that this has been a matter of speculation for more than a century and the question of determining when precisely peaking will occur remains unsettled. It is important to note that when world oil production peaks, large oil reserves will still remain.</P>
        <P>Among the conclusions of the report are that oil peaking will create a severe liquid fuels problem for the transportation sector and that the production of large amounts of substitute liquid fuels will be required to mitigate impacts. It notes that such production is feasible with existing technology and that future research is also likely to provide additional mitigation options. The peaking of global oil production presents a risk management problem in that if mitigation efforts are initiated earlier than required they may turn out to be premature if peaking is long delayed. On the other hand, if peaking is imminent, failure to initiate timely mitigation could be extremely damaging. As the report recognises, the most <Col N="713"/>effective action to combat the peaking of world oil production requires a better understanding of the clear signals as to when peaking might occur, an understanding that can be improved through accelerated, in-depth public and private research on oil peaking mitigation options.</P>
        <P>While I have undertaken no specific analysis into the area of peaking of world oil production, Ireland supports and has access to this type of research through its membership of the International Energy Agency, IEA, and the European Union. Reliance on oil must however, be substituted over time if world economic development and living standards are to be sustained. Government policy on the sustainable use of energy is directed through Sustainable Energy Ireland and that body has commenced a challenging work programme focusing on deployment of energy efficiency measures across all sectors of the economy. In addition, my Department is developing a policy to promote the increased penetration of biofuels in Ireland&rsquo;s transport chain. As part of this policy, a pilot scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels was launched in April 2005. Applications under the scheme are being assessed with a view to making a recommendation to the Department of Finance shortly. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.</P>

	<P>Wild salmon stocks are under threat from a variety of adverse environmental and other pressures which impact on marine survival as well as in our rivers and estuaries. As Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I am fully aware that these pressures, along with excessive exploitation of salmon stocks, pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this valuable resource.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>Since 2002, the Government has implemented a strategy to ensure, through progressive reductions in the commercial catch, that the conservation limits specified by the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission are being reached. This policy of promoting the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling has delivered significant overall catch reductions aimed at achieving the objective of restoration of salmon stocks.</P><Col N="714"/>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>The central and regional fisheries boards devote considerable effort and resources, in collaboration with Tourism Ireland, to the promotion of angling abroad. I am advised that the overall decline in angling tourism is not unique to Ireland but reflects a trend widespread in Europe. The report of the tourism policy review group to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in September 2003 observed a decline in activity holidays generally which is not confined to angling.</P>
        <P>The conservation measures which have been implemented to date on the recommendation of the National Salmon Commission deliver a practical mechanism to effect the protection of salmon stocks while acknowledging the important role angling plays in attracting tourists to Ireland. These measures, which are necessary to minimise the impact on our valuable wild salmon stocks, are aimed at providing an adequate season for tourism angling.</P>

        <Quest>the new target date by which Ireland will reach 0.7% of GDP in respect of overseas development aid; if he will set out a multi-annual plan to reach this target and enshrine Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the 0.7% target in legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The allocation to Vote 29 &mdash; vote for international co-operation &mdash; for 2005 is &euro;470.8 million, an increase of &euro;70 million on the 2004 figure. As a result, total official development assistance, ODA, for 2005 is expected to amount to approximately &euro;545 million, when contributions from other Departments have been taken into account. This represents the highest allocation in the 30-year history of the Irish aid programme. In addition, the Government has agreed to provide further increases of &euro;65 million in 2006 and 2007. These very substantial increases mean that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, &euro;1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance. This three-year multi-annual commitment, incorporating very substantial annual increases, gives my Department a sound basis to carry forward the long term planning which is so important for development work.</P>
        <P>The EU has recently agreed new targets for ODA. These provide that the EU 15 will reach a new collective target of 0.56% by 2010, while member states, which have not yet reached a level of 0.51%, undertake to individually reach that by 2010. Member states also undertake to achieve the UN target of 0.7% by 2015. The newer member states, which joined after 2002, <Col N="716"/>have lower targets. This decision will bring an estimated &euro;20 billion extra funding by 2010 into play for developing countries and represents a strong signal to other non-European donors.</P>
        <P>The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target. The issue of how best to meet the target, and in what timeframe, is under ongoing and active review. In this regard, and as I have stated previously, it is not intended that the commitment should be enshrined in legislation.</P>

These individuals were paid between &euro;100 and &euro;150 each by Red Dog Design, the company that won the competition to design the logo and brand the Presidency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Hammersmith and Fulham Irish Centre provides our community in the west of London with a vibrant focal point through its cultural activities. A second Irish organisation, the Irish Charitable Trust, has offices in the same building as the centre, and provides invaluable assistance to Irish people who may find themselves in vulnerable circumstances and at risk of social exclusion.</P>
        <P>The building in which both organisations have their offices is owned by the local council. The Irish Charitable Trust is in discussion with the local council concerning the rent level of the offices it occupies, and I believe the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to this issue. While we have not at this time been approached on the rent issue, I have asked officials at the embassy in London to remain in close contact with the trust to ensure that we are fully aware of developments with a view to our being helpful in every way possible. The trust has, however, made an application for support for salaries under the current round of D&iacute;on grant applications and this application will be considered sympathetically.</P>
        <P>Last year, D&iacute;on funding to the Irish Charitable Trust in Hammersmith amounted to &euro;124,000. While the bulk of this figure went towards staffing costs, a special grant of &euro;40,000 was provided by way of additional support to the trust in meeting its overall costs. The vice-chair of the Federation of Irish Societies, an organisation which is also strongly supported by D&iacute;on funding, has been appointed to the board of the trust with a <Col N="718"/>view to strengthening its management team and enhancing its capacity to negotiate effectively with the local authorities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two votes: Vote 28 &mdash; foreign affairs; and Vote 29 &mdash; international co-operation. From 1998 to date the Department spent &euro;3,756,592 on 40 consultancies for Vote 28 and &euro;10,700,611 on 761 consultancies for Vote 29, giving a total of 801 consultancies at a cost of &euro;14,457,203. The Department commissions consultancies where specialised knowledge and-or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of the Development Cooperation Ireland, DCI, programme, where an independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. DCI consultancies cover a wide range of sectors including HIV-AIDS, education, health and rural development.</P>
        <P>Under Vote 28, the majority of expenditure on consultancies for the period in question related to the upgrading of the Department&rsquo;s information technology infrastructure at headquarters and at its missions abroad and the automated passport system, APS. The latter is essential to meet future demands for passports in an efficient and effective manner and to comply with new international security regulations for passports. Once these projects are complete, it is expected that engagement of consultants will be significantly reduced.</P>
        <P>The following tables list all the consultancies under each Vote covering the entire period in question.</P>

All staff are contracted under terms and conditions of employment set by the Minister for Finance and are employed on a full-time basis. All appointments will terminate no later than the date on which I cease to hold this office. This compares favourably with my rainbow Government predecessor who had more than twice the number of advisers during his tenure as Minister for Foreign Affairs and T&aacute;naiste.</P><Col N="759"/>

        <Quest>the progress, which has been made in bringing to justice the person responsible for the murder of two Irish soldiers (details supplied).</Quest>
        <QRef>[22639/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government has, over many years, sought to ensure that justice was attained in this most tragic of cases. Moreover, the legal issues involved have been reviewed on a number of occasions with a view to determining whether persons alleged to have committed these crimes could be brought to justice.</P>
        <P>There are, as has been stated before in the House, considerable legal obstacles in the way of bringing a prosecution in this case. For example, the question of seeking the extradition to the State for trial here of the alleged perpetrators of these crimes does not arise because the Irish courts do not have jurisdiction to try persons for acts such as these committed by non-nationals outside the State. An extradition request would therefore have to be made by the state in which the crime was committed, namely Lebanon, with a view to a criminal prosecution there. In addition, the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which was inspired by the need to improve the level of protection of personnel serving on UN missions and to ensure the punishment of individuals who do not respect the mandate of UN peacekeepers, entered into force on 15 January 1999 and does not apply retrospectively.</P>
        <P>However, my Department and the Department of Defence have been, and remain, in consultation with the authorities of the jurisdiction in which the principal suspect is currently residing, the United States, and with those of Lebanon, where the killings occurred, to ensure that every potential avenue for action is fully explored. The Deputy will understand that, given the sensitive nature of such contacts and the potential for undermining any future legal course of action, it is not possible to disclose the details of such contacts. However, I can assure the Deputy that the Government continues to explore with the relevant authorities the possibilities open to it to seek justice in this case.</P>

        <Quest>and Tourism the position regarding the application from an association (details supplied) in County Dublin for a major grant towards its project; the status of the confirmation by his predecessor that he had approved the preliminary report submitted by Fingal County Council for the project in Skerries, County Dublin.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>A preliminary report on the proposal for a swimming pool in Skerries, submitted by Fingal County Council on behalf of Fingal Swimming Pool Association, was approved in January 2001. This approval allowed for the preparation of detailed contract documents for the project. No such documentation has been received. However, Fingal County Council recently indicated to my Department that following an internal review and the coming into force of a new county development plan, it is now in a position to advance the pool project. The project will be considered further when the contract documents are received.</P>
        <P>The local authority swimming pool programme, administered by my Department, has four principal stages in a swimming pool project: feasibility study and preliminary report; contract documents; tender; and construction. My Department&rsquo;s technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, OPW, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is not allocated until the tenders have been approved for a project. The maximum grant available under the programme is &euro;3.8 million, which is available towards either the refurbishment of an existing pool or the provision of a new pool, subject in either cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of a project located in disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. The local authority must provide the balance of the financing directly or in a combination of local authority funding, community group financing, private sector etc.</P>
        <P>Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, the proposal must be considered, supported and submit<Col N="767"/>ted by the relevant local authority. Before supporting a project, the local authority must be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, will have a satisfactory level of public access.</P>
        <P>Projects are considered on a case by case basis and consideration is given to such issues as whether the area is classified as disadvantaged, the number and geographical spread of projects within and between counties, the viability of the project, particularly regarding operational and maintenance issues, overall funding package for the project, technical details and the Depart<Col N="768"/>ment&rsquo;s annual Estimates provision for the programme.</P>

        <P>The national lottery funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and com<Col N="773"/>munity organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis. Applications for funding under the 2005 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 5 and 6 December last. The closing date for receipt of applications was 4 February 2005. All of the 1,362 applications received before that deadline, including one from each of the organisations in question, are being evaluated against the programme&rsquo;s assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The importance of tourism as an instrument of national and regional development has long been recognised by this Government and, in that context, achieving as wide as possible a distribution of visitor numbers across the different regions with an associated spread of tourism revenue continues to be a major objective and challenge for tourism policy.</P>
        <P>Various factors have conspired to exacerbate regional growth problems in recent years, most notably the increasing international trend towards shorter more frequent breaks, which favour the more easily accessible urban destinations. This factor has driven the more robust growth in Dublin and the eastern region. At a time of overall national tourism growth, I remain concerned that the issue of regional spread should be proactively and energetically addressed. National tourism policy has been evolving in recent years, with a particular emphasis arising from the &ldquo;New Horizons&rdquo; policy review on putting policy measures in place to achieve a wider spread of tourism business. Key actions that I would highlight include those relating to product development, tourism promotion, access transport and the appropriate infrastructure and arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy at regional level.</P>
        <P>The failure to develop good quality direct access to the regions has been a major impediment to growth in the past. Fortunately, this situation has improved greatly in recent times and this summer will see the greatest ever number of air seats to Ireland and particularly servicing the regions of the west and north west. These new routes from Britain, mainland Europe and the US are being promoted heavily by Tourism Ireland in order to optimise their tourism impact. Ensur<Col N="774"/>ing a top class product is available to those who visit the regions is also a major priority. The &euro;50 million tourism product development scheme is vital in this context in that it targets support for new product development on developing and underdeveloped regions.</P>
        <P>In the case of marketing, we need to ensure our investment here is optimal. A major increased investment of over 17% in the &euro;36 million tourism marketing fund this year will ensure that Tourism Ireland can redevelop and revitalise tourism brand Ireland. A new arsenal of marketing communications based on the best consumer research available will be deployed to ensure destination Ireland remains a compelling proposition for overseas tourists. This year, both Tourism Ireland and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are rolling out a variety of innovative marketing and publicity programmes aimed at generating a sustained focus on the regions. This includes supporting new regional access routes, twinning arrangements between overseas Tourism Ireland offices and individual regional tourism authorities, RTAs, enhanced resources for marketing activities by the RTAs and a new strategy for capturing business from Britain, our key source market that traditionally benefited the regions.</P>
        <P>Initiatives such as the &euro;1 million &ldquo;Go West&rdquo; campaign, which I launched recently on behalf of the regional tourism authorities along the western seaboard, identify Britain as the key battleground this year. The intelligent targeting of investment at this vital source market is consistent with the type of approach advocated by Tourism Ireland in its new strategy for Britain. Domestic tourism, which represents one fifth of all tourism revenue, is particularly important to the regions with a large proportion of this business favouring them rather than Dublin. A major reinvigorated domestic campaign has been launched this year by F&aacute;ilte Ireland at a cost of over &euro;3.3 million with a particular emphasis on driving business to the special industry offers available on the <i>www.ireland.ie</i> website.</P>
        <P>Visitors cannot be forced to go to a particular location against their will. The responsibility primarily lies with the individual communities and operators in the regions to present and market compelling attractions, facilities, accommodation and experiences that deliver value for money and quality service. For its part, F&aacute;ilte Ireland fully accepts that an increased emphasis on targeted marketing, product development and enterprise support is required at regional level. It will be working over the coming months with the industry and the regions towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the regional structures in place to service the needs of the visitor and the needs of the industry. The Government will continue to support and encourage such developments through a range of policies and programme by the tourism State agencies. As the House will be aware, I have no direct responsibility for individual actions or measures relating <Col N="775"/>to tourism promotion or development in so far as specific areas of the country are concerned. These are a day to day function of the tourism agencies.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Applications under the sports capital programme are assessed in accordance with detailed assessment criteria to improve the selection process that were introduced following a comprehensive review of my Department&rsquo;s programme completed in December 1998. Among the factors covered by the criteria are the level of socio-economic disadvantage in the area and the extent to which the project will increase participation in such areas, current and planned levels of sport and-or recreational sport facilities in the area and the priority of proposed improvements-facilities in respect of existing facilities, the need to achieve an equitable spread of funds both geographically having regard to existing facilities and among different sports and community groups, the extent to which the project will increase the levels of active participation in sport and/or recreational sport, the financial viability of the project, the level of own funding available by the applicant towards the project and the extent to which the applicant will be able to maintain the project after completion and the priorities for their individual sports, as identified by the national governing bodies.</P>
        <P>Regard is given to the population levels in each county and to providing a <i>pro rata</i> level of funding on that basis. The assessment process must also take into account existing levels of facilities in an area and also the strategic positioning of major facilities that may be required and the quality of applications received for such projects. Applications under the programme are received from organisations for local, regional and national facilities. Each year, a number of major regional, national and municipal multi-sport projects are allocated funding following consultations with the Irish Sports Council, other Government Departments and the relevant national governing bodies of sport and local authorities in respect of their respective priorities for the provision of sporting facilities. The level of this funding may distort the total allocations to the counties in which they are located.</P>
        <P>My Department also administers the local authority swimming pool programme, which provides grant aid towards the capital costs of a new pool, a replacement pool or the refurbishment of an existing pool. The programme provides for a <Col N="778"/>maximum grant level of 80% of eligible costs or 90% in the case of disadvantaged areas subject to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million. The closing date for receipt of applications under the current programme was 31 July 2000. There are four principal stages in a swimming pool project. These, in order of progress, are a feasibility study-preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department&rsquo;s technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, OPW, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is not allocated until the tenders have been approved for a project. Since 2000, grant aid has been approved towards the cost of the following swimming pool projects.</P>

        <P>I would like to add that the protection of workers from exposure to asbestos at work is covered by the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations 1989 (S.I. No. 34 of 1989), as amended. These regulations, <i>inter alia</i>, transpose Council Directive 83/477/EEC of 19 September 1983 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work. Directive 83/477/EEC has in turn been amended on a number of occasions, most recently by Directive 2003/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the council. That directive is required to be transposed into national law by the member states by 15 April 2006. Enforcement of the regulations in places of work is carried out by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the approval by Enterprise Ireland of a capital grant of &euro;200,000 for a food enterprise centre on the Coolnanave industrial estate under its community enterprise centre 2002 scheme. A decision on funding is a day-to-day matter for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I am directly involved.</P>
        <P>I am informed by Enterprise Ireland that Ballyhoura Development Group, with whom it has <Col N="781"/>been working on an ongoing basis towards development in the area, got approval for this new food business incubator to be co-funded through BES in December 2004 and the project is at the planning stage. When complete, the proposed 10,000 square feet facility will be able to accommodate four to five new food businesses. Initial indications suggest that strong demand exists for incubation space developed to food-related specifications. A food forum committee, of which Enterprise Ireland is a member, has been inaugurated to drive this project forward.</P>
        <P>I am informed that following a joint initiative by Cork County Council, North Cork Enterprise Board and Mitchelstown credit union, four small advance industrial units are being provided in the Coolnanave region at a cost of &euro;350,000 in order to facilitate the emergence of new small business. Construction commenced in August 2004 and is now completed. Advertisements for these are currently running in the local press. The financial contribution of the CEB to these units was &euro;120,000.</P>

	<P>There were three reinstatements awarded by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in 2002, one in 2003 and five in 2004 under Section 7 (1)(<i>a</i>) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977. In regard to the average payout to successful applicants, I have interpreted the question to refer to decisions of the tribunal in unfair dismissals cases generally and not specifically to re-instatements. The distribution in each of 2002, 2003 and 2004 was as follows: The tribunal awarded a total of &euro;973,045.22 in respect of 183 decisions for unfair dismissal in 2002, of which the average payout to successful applicants was &euro;5,317.19. The tribunal awarded a total of &euro;2,050,416.24 in respect of 216 decisions for unfair dismissal in 2003, of which the average payout to successful applicants was &euro;9,492.67. The tribunal awarded a total of &euro;1,923,400.15 in respect of 191 decisions for unfair dismissal in 2004, of which the average payout to successful applicants was &euro;10,070.16. Under Statutory Instrument No. 24 of 1968, the tribunal is not empowered to award legal costs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 to 410, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Research and Standards (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture) Order, 1995, S.I. 316 of 1995, regulates the fire safety aspects of furniture which also includes bedding. The objective of the order is to ensure that domestic furniture is designed, manufactured and constructed <Col N="783"/>to a particular standard so as not to endanger persons or property. Furniture is accepted as complying with this order if it has been manufactured to IS 419:1988 or its equivalent European or individual EU member states standards and has been certified as such by the competent authority in the member states of manufacture. The order also applies to furniture imported from non-EU countries.</P>
        <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for enforcing this order and is independent in discharging this function. The Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs has an authorised complement of 20 inspectors involved in enforcing approximately 80 items of legislation. While inspectors are not allocated specific legislation, the work of the inspectorate is determined by reference to the risks posed to consumers and the availability of resources at any given time. The table sets out the number of investigations carried out each year between 1995 and 1998.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Investigations ceased in 1998 following receipt of legal advice by the Director of Consumer Affairs that indicated that the director&rsquo;s powers to investigate offences under the order were deficient. The director&rsquo;s power to prosecute offences under the regulations was not affected. The legal deficiency was confirmed by the advice of the Attorney General. Since then, my Department has sought an appropriate opportunity to have amending legislation introduced in Bills before the Oireachtas. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the director&rsquo;s investigative powers have been restored by virtue of the recent passage of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004 through the Houses of the Oireachtas, section 89 in particular. The Bill was signed by the President on 22 June 2005 and it is proposed that the necessary commencement order will be signed shortly.</P>
        <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs has informed me that while she has not received any consumer complaints relating to products covered by the order since 2003 a small number of manufacturers have complained that compliance with the order puts them at a competitive disadvantage. These companies have also alleged that certain imported products are not compliant with the order. The director has indicated that, following the restoration of her investigative powers, the order will be enforced in a manner commensurate with the risks posed to consumers and within resources available to her. The director has also indicated that complaints made in relation to this issue will be fully investigated.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland in the west region is investing significantly in the provision of a number of planned and focused property solutions. IDA Ireland is developing world class business and technology parks at a number of towns throughout the west region, including Ballinasloe. The goal is to ensure that these locations have the appropriate property solutions tailored to specific key sectoral targets to attract inward investments. This means the provision of a high quality business and technology park and, in co-operation with the private sector, the provision of a new advance technology building in the town. It also means undertaking long-term planning with the local authority so that the area is seen by investors as having the appropriate locational solutions for key strategic investments of national importance, such as property, infrastructure, business and lifestyle services, etc.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is actively promoting Ballinasloe for new foreign investment and is committed to the development of County Galway. It has acquired 35 acres of land at Creagh on the east side of Ballinasloe and has developed it as a new business and technology park. It has co-operated closely with local private developers to construct a 27,000 sq. ft. advance technology building on the park, which is now occupied by Valois, a French engineering company that is successfully operating a manufacturing facility there. The company plans to employ 60 people at full production and is making excellent progress against plan. The construction of a further advance technology building on the park, with an area of 29,000 sq. ft. is reaching completion and is being marketed to potential investors.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has also provided a site to the ESB for the construction of a 38 kV station to satisfy the electricity needs of new projects locating on the park. Construction of the station has begun. Total investment in the park to date is approximately &euro;7.5 million for both site development works and the construction of two advance technology buildings. IDA Ireland is actively working with existing base of overseas companies in the county and the Ballinasloe area to encourage them to grow and expand. Since January 2005, there has been six first time site visits to Ballinasloe. In addition, the agency is working with local groups, utility providers and other agencies to ensure that the county secures the appropriate infrastructure to enable the existing <Col N="785"/>companies grow and develop and to make the area sufficiently attractive for new projects.</P>

The goal is to ensure that these locations have the appropriate property solutions, tailored to specific key sectoral targets, to attract inward investments.

It also means undertaking long-term planning with the local authority so that the area is seen by investors as having the appropriate locational solutions for key strategic investments of national importance, for example, property, infrastructure, business and lifestyle services, etc.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is committed to the development of County Galway and is investing in the provision of focused and planned property solutions for Tuam. It has acquired 27 acres of land on the Dunmore road in Tuam and has developed it as a new business and technology park. IDA Ireland has received advance planning permission for the construction of two 7,500 sq.ft. and two 5,000 sq.ft. advance technology units on the park. Site development works for the provision of these units have just been completed. Tenders for the development of the aforementioned units will shortly be sought from the private sector. IDA Ireland&rsquo;s total investment in the park to date is in the order of &euro;3.5 million.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing knowledge based, value added FDI for Tuam and is actively marketing the town to potential investors.

	<P>The statutory remit of the Health and Safety Authority is confined to the investigation of accidents in places of work. Issues such as whether or not road surfaces laid down in road works are left in a safe state fall outside occupational safety and health legislation and the functions of the Health and Safety Authority. As I stated in the reply to the Parliamentary Question No. 409 on 14 June, in the specific case of the Mayo accident, the Health and Safety Authority wrote to the primary family in question and explained why it was not carrying out an investigation. The primary responsibility for investigating accidents which occur on public roads lies with the Garda.</P>

        <Quest>the number of labour inspectors that have been appointed to date in regard to his announcement of the recruitment of an additional 11; when the full number will be appointed; the current establishment level of the labour inspectorate; the number currently serving as labour inspectors; if any of the labour inspectorate staff are working in any other areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 12 April I announced my intention to appoint an additional ten labour inspectors together with a team leader. The team leader has been appointed and commenced training within the inspectorate. In addition, preparations are under way to facilitate the transfer of six officers to inspector posts following a competitive interview process. It is anticipated that these officers will be in place by mid-July. A further process has commenced with a view to urgently identifying officers to complete the complement of sanctioned staffing for the inspectorate.</P>
        <P>As a result of the increase in resources, there are now 31 labour inspector posts. There are 21 officers currently assigned as inspectors of which 16.5 are serving at present. One inspector is currently on long-term sick leave and one jobsharing inspector is on extended unpaid leave. A further two inspectors are currently engaged in work with the Employment Appeals Tribunal to assist with processing a backlog of cases. One further inspec<Col N="787"/>tor has recently been facilitated in regard to a long-standing request for a transfer from the labour inspectorate. This officer will be replaced from the current recruitment process mentioned above. However, it is also worth noting that of the serving officers, two of them are temporarily incapacitated as a consequence of accidents resulting in serious injury. Neither case was work related.</P>
        <P>In the course of dealing with a recent high profile case, the services of three inspectors were exclusively dedicated to the task. There was also a very considerable input of time by two senior personnel from the employment rights compliance section. The breadth and complexity of the inspectorate&rsquo;s remit is such that officers&rsquo; training occurs over an extended period of time. Much of this training is undertaken in the company of an experienced officer who will take time to explain the issues at hand and assist the trainee inspector in developing the skills and confidence necessary to take on the tasks alone. This activity does have a short-term impact on the capacity of the training officer to complete normal schedules of work. It should be noted that additional officers assigned to the inspectorate earlier this year are nearing completion of that training process. Up to quite recently the number of inspectors was 17. When the assignment of the new group of ten inspectors is complete, the labour inspectorate will have increased to 31, almost a doubling of its complement.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which Ireland&rsquo;s statutory redundancy entitlements compare with those of European Union <Col N="788"/>partners; the cost to the Exchequer of emulating the highest level of redundancy entitlements in the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Redundancy payments often reflect the labour market culture of a country. Legislation is light in some member states to allow for a more flexible and competitive labour market. Other governments take a more active role to protect employees. In some EU countries, redundancy amounts are negotiated, while in this country and the UK redundancy is based on a legal right to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant. Given that redundancy payments are not dealt with in a similar fashion in other member states, it is not possible to provide definitive comparisons on redundancy payments.</P>
        <P>However, a set of comparisons has been made available by Mercer Human Resources Consultants. This chart shows variations in redundancy pay in the 15 EU States at 27 May 2003 in respect of white collar workers aged 40 made redundant after ten years service on a salary of &euro;30,000. Ireland shows a figure of &euro;10,666, which is 21 weeks pay at the then ceiling of &euro;507.90 per week. Since 1 January 2005, the ceiling on wages has increased to &euro;600 per week and, therefore, 21 weeks pay at &euro;600 would amount to &euro;12,600.</P>
        <P>On perusal of the relevant chart, Italy and Spain appear to show the highest rate of redundancy, while the UK is at the lower end of the scale. In the case of several countries no minimum severance pay is shown. As the terms of the Irish statutory redundancy scheme have been improved considerably in recent years, there is no intention at this stage to seek to emulate the minimum severance pay in Italy and Spain.</P><Col N="787"/>

	<P>The decision to support companies is a day-to-day matter for the agencies under my remit and not one in which I have a direct function. Data on employment in the agencies is compiled from an annual employment sur<Col N="790"/>vey carried out by Forf&aacute;s. The most recent survey provides figures for client companies of the IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland up to the end of 2004.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland client companies gained 71,785 permanent full-time jobs over the period 2000-04. Permanent full-time employment in Enterprise Ireland client companies now stands at 142,115. Regarding contract and part-time jobs, there were 21,620 gains between 2000 and 2004. A table setting out details by year shows details. IDA Ireland client companies gained 67,379 new jobs in the period 2000-04. A table sets out details by year. </P><Col N="789"/>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and the County Enterprise Boards, which are the bodies under my remit. Data on employment in the agencies is compiled from an annual employment survey carried out by Forf&aacute;s. <Col N="792"/>The most recent survey provides figures up to the end of 2004. Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s client portfolio is primarily composed of companies that are Irish-owned. However, companies in the food and natural resources sectors are also dealt with by Enterprise Ireland regardless of ownership.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland client companies gained 38,218 jobs in the past three years. This was offset by losses in the order of 45,959. Foreign-owned client companies showed gains of 1,623 and losses of 4,483 for the period in question, while Irish-owned companies showed gains of 36,595 and losses of 41,476. On a sectoral basis, internationally traded services companies showed gains of 9,549 and losses of 9,182, while manufacturing companies showed gains of 28,669 and losses of 36,777.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland is responsible for foreign direct investment. For the period 2002-04, client companies in the manufacturing sector showed gains of 15,374 and losses of 24,291, while in the international financial services sector client companies recorded gains of 15,955 and losses of 14,583. Irish-owned client companies of Shannon Development in the manufacturing sector, including those located on the Shannon free zone, SFZ, showed gains of 1,817 for the period 2002-04 and losses of 2,182, while Irish-owned client companies in the internationally traded services sector, including those on the SFZ, showed gains of 446 and losses of 484. In respect of foreign-owned companies located on the SFZ, companies in the manufacturing sector showed gains of 312 for the period 2002-04 and losses of 868, while companies in the international services sector recorded gains of 434 and losses of 330.</P>
        <P>The 35 county enterprise boards, CEBs, are charged with the development of indigenous domestic enterprises generally employing up to ten people. Data is available on the net increase or decrease in the number of jobs by clients of the CEBs. Data is compiled by all boards across all sectors on an annual basis only. Over the period 2002 to December 2004, job numbers in clients of the CEBs increased by 5,243.</P>

        <P FLI="0">In addition to financial support, EI provides a range of non-financial support to its client companies, including market supports, human resource development, technical know how and expertise. Through its network of 33 international offices, EI assists companies to create and implement successful strategies for market entry, development and growth. Services provided include arranging access to international buyers and increasing the number of in-market trade promotion activities. Companies are also assisted to develop awareness, knowledge and understanding of markets and to build the marketing capabilities to fully exploit the opportunities available in overseas markets. For example, in 2004 Enterprise Ireland actively supported 177 clients to enter new markets, organised over 9,500 client-buyer meetings across all sectors and markets, organised 56 missions both at home and abroad to introduce clients to top level buyers and facilitated new market opportunities for 199 clients through participation at 21 trade fairs.</P>
        <P>EI&rsquo;s non-financial supports to enhance in company research and development include the research and development awareness campaign and the innovation management initiative, which provide training on all aspects of innovation and research and development management. A total <Col N="794"/>of 398 company personnel participated in these initiatives in 2004. Under the EI applied benchmarking for competitiveness initiative, which supports client companies striving to increase their productivity, a total of 91 individual clients were benchmarked against their sectoral peer group in Europe in 2004. In addition, 59 client company participants were assisted to prepare and strengthen their first export strategies under the EI first flight initiative.</P>
        <P>EI provides spaces for company creation through its nationwide incubator construction programme to support spin-off companies at third level institutions. By the end of 2004, &euro;32 million had been committed to 15 centres at the institutes of technology around the country and these are now coming on stream. In the period 2003 to 2004, EI has also provided financial support for the conversion of six existing buildings in universities-hospitals into bio-incubators which will provide laboratory and office space of up to 20 start-up companies.</P>
        <P>Through its community enterprise programme, Enterprise Ireland works with local community groups in the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment of micro enterprises. In 2004, seven new community enterprise centres were completed in Macroom, Carlow, Lismore, Easkey, Ballyshannon, Moville and Emyvale and the centre in Ballina was expanded. A total of 97 such centres, involving an investment of &euro;23 million by Enterprise Ireland, are now operational throughout the regions with associated employment of 3,000 people.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland, including its regions and areas. IDA Ireland is committed to regional development as a core part of its strategy and has set itself a high level performance target for the BMW region, including counties Cavan and Monaghan. This commits IDA Ireland to try to achieve a 50% target of all new greenfield jobs to be located in the region in the period 2000-06.</P>
        <P>Substantial progress has being made in attracting new jobs to the BMW given that in 1999, prior to the start of the Government&rsquo;s current national development programme, only some 25% of all new greenfield jobs were located in the region. By 2004, a total of 41% of all new greenfield jobs created by IDA Ireland-supported companies were located in the BMW region. Through its network of local and overseas offices, the IDA is actively marketing both counties on an ongoing basis as a location for FDI. Work in counties Cavan and Monaghan by Enterprise Ireland and by the local county enterprise boards in respect of indigenous SMEs and micro-enterprises complements the work done by IDA Ireland. In the case of Enterprise Ireland, the maximum grant levels available as part of its funding offer are higher in the BMW region, including Cavan and Monaghan, than in the south <Col N="798"/>and east region and a higher proportion of this funding is also non-repayable.</P>

	<P>The 35 county and city enterprise boards, CEBs, are charged with the development of indigenous domestic enterprises employing up to ten people. Leitrim County Enterprise Board is actively involved in the economic and social development of the county and continues to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximize entrepreneurial development throughout 2005.</P>
        <P>Data on the net number of jobs created by the CEBs is compiled across all sectors on an annual basis only. From 2000 to the end of May 2005, Leitrim CEB approved &euro;1.662 million in grant assistance, which has assisted in the creation of 240 jobs, 142 of which are in the manufacturing sector and 98 of which are in local services. This represents an average cost per job of approximately &euro;6,900. A detailed breakdown of the data requested by the Deputy is appended in tabular format.</P>

	<P>I propose to takes Questions Nos. 431 and 435 together.</P>
        <P>Diet supplements are provided for under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. The amount of supplement payable depends on which of two categories of diet has been prescribed by the applicant&rsquo;s medical adviser, low cost or high cost, and the income of the individual and his or her dependants. As diet supplements are subject to a means test, the amount payable decreases as household income increases.</P>
        <P>The western region of the executive has advised that the rate of diet supplement previously in payment to the person concerned had been on his income from disability allowance. The person concerned subsequently transferred to an old age pension and his entitlement to diet supplement was reviewed to take account of the increase in his income, in accordance with the scheme rules. Following the review, his revised entitlement is equivalent to &euro;5.50 per month. The person has been advised by the executive of his right of appeal against this decision but there is no record that he had done so to date. Apart from the diet supplement, the executive is not aware of any other application by the person for supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 432 and 433 together.</P>
        <P>The decentralisation implementation group, DIG, report to the Minister for Finance on 19 November 2004 recommended the locations and organisations to be included in the first phase of moves under the decentralisation programme and those to be regarded as potential early movers. Neither Carrickmacross nor Monaghan was included in the first phase of moves or as a potential early mover. The DIG is due to report again shortly regarding the phasing of those locations not covered in the November report.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Office of Public Works, OPW, that it is in discussions with Monaghan County Council regarding a proposed development in Carrickmacross. The OPW has further advised that it is currently exploring a number of property options in Monaghan. These include the proposed refurbishment of an existing office and the construction of a new building. My Department is currently revising its implementation plan for the first phase of moves and will examine subsequent phases in the light of this and of the next DIG report.</P>

	<P>My Department provides people receiving social welfare payments with a range of payment options, including electronic fund transfer, EFT. The majority of those who opt for this facility do so at the start of their claim and are paid on a regular weekly basis once their claim is put into payment. When EFT was introduced, payments were made four weeks in arrears. In 2000, the payment frequency was reduced to two weeks in areas and it was further reduced to one week in arrears in November 2004. The issue of the further alignment of EFT payments with that of other payment methods, including the elimination of the week in arrears payment, is being addressed and the necessary arrangements will be made as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>Rent supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Rent supplements are subject to a means test. In addition to a minimum contribution of &euro;13, which a recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources, each applicant is also required to contribute any additional assessable means he or she has over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards his or her rent.</P><Col N="802"/>
        <P>As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 443 of 14 June 2005, the person concerned has incurred an overpayment of rent supplement as she failed to inform the Health Service Executive of a significant increase in the level of her household income over the past year arising from her participation on a F&Aacute;S programme. The Dublin-mid-Leinster area of the executive has advised that, on the basis of her current means, the person concerned is not entitled to rent supplement and that it has terminated payment to her. It wrote to her recently to confirm the level of the overpayment involved and has asked her to contact her local community welfare officer with a view to making arrangements to repay the amount due. To date, she has not made contact with the community welfare officer.</P>

Following a review of her entitlement in January 2005, a deciding officer made a revised decision disallowing her claim from 25 February 2002 to 30 November 2004 on the grounds that her means, derived from her partner&rsquo;s income, were in excess of the statutory limit for payment of unemployment assistance applicable to a person with her family size and circumstances.

The common travel area includes Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The southern region of the Health Service Executive has advised that the person concerned was refused supplementary welfare allowance on the grounds that he does not satisfy the habitual residency condition. The executive has further advised that he has appealed against this decision. An appeals officer of the executive will make a determination on his eligibility as soon as possible and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>

	<P>The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities. The Department jointly funds the food costs with these local authorities, who also manage and fund the administration of the scheme. The second is the school meals local projects <Col N="807"/>scheme, through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas for specific school meals projects. This has recently been expanded to include pre-schools that are community based and which operate on a not-for-profit basis.</P>
        <P>In 2004, the provision for the school meals programme was &euro;6.08 million in total, including &euro;4.95 million for the school projects and &euro;1.13 million towards the urban school meals scheme operated by the participating local authorities. The school meals scheme is demand led and demand from schools and local communities was fully met. Under the local projects scheme, some 41,300 children benefited in 451 schools, 124 secondary schools and 327 primary schools, at a cost of &euro;3.56 million, which represented a substantial increase over 2003 when expenditure was &euro;1.76 million.</P>
        <P>The total provision available to my Department for this scheme for 2005 is &euro;5.2 million. This allocation allows for more extensive take-up of the scheme by schools and parent or community groups. The scheme has significant social and educational benefits in assisting towards improved child nutrition and in encouraging regular school attendance. I encourage schools and groups to utilise the scheme from the start of the next school year in September. The Department of Education and Science is using its schools completion programme and Giving Children an Even Break initiative to encourage the introduction and extension of school meals projects. In addition, my Department has recently assigned an extra officer to pilot additional ways of encouraging schools and groups to participate in the scheme. I am confident that these initiatives will lead to increased use by schools of this very valuable programme.</P>

        <Quest> if he will change the situation whereby contributory old age pensioners on reduced rate pension who made part of their contributions pre-1953 are not entitled to claim anything on their pre-1953 contributions without relinquishing their post-1953 contributory pension entitlements.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Pre-1953 contributions are very different to those made under the unified system of social insurance that applied from 1953 in that they do not contain any element towards the cost of contributory pensions. The special old age contributory pension based on pre-1953 insurance was introduced to enable such contributions to reckon for pension purposes subject to certain conditions in order to enable people who would <Col N="808"/>not otherwise qualify for a payment under the standard qualifying conditions to qualify for a pension.</P>
        <P>To qualify for this special pension, a person must have commenced insurable employment under the National Health Insurance Acts and have a total of at least 260 full-rate social insurance contributions paid since then. The 260 contributions can be made up solely of contributions paid prior to 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts or of a combination of contributions paid before 1953 and after 1953 under the Social Welfare Acts. Pre-1953 contributions can be used to satisfy the first two qualifying conditions for contributory pensions which require a person to have entered social insurance ten years before pension age and have at least 260 social insurance contributions paid since first entering insurance. However, they may not be used to satisfy the average contribution test which, subject to the other conditions being satisfied, determines the rate at which a pension is paid. I am satisfied that the range of pensions available ensures that people receive good value for the contributions they have made. In the circumstances, there are no plans to introduce a change in policy along the lines suggested.</P>

	<P>The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme. The scheme was introduced from 1994 and allows up to 20 years spent on caring duties to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s insurance record is being averaged to assess entitlement for contributory pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension as the standard qualifying conditions relating to the type and number of contributions paid or credited must also be satisfied.</P>
        <P>In August 2000, the Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. This review also included a general examination of the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme and the report suggested a number of reforms for further consideration. These included the possibility of changing the operative date of the scheme and replacing the disregard system with one based on actual credited contributions. The question of backdating the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is being examined but it does give rise to difficult and complex issues, not least of which is the position of other groups excluded from social insurance cover over the <Col N="809"/>years and who do not qualify for contributory pensions.</P>
        <P>The cost of backdating the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is difficult to estimate as it depends on the date from which the scheme would operate and the improvement it would make in pensions paid to existing social welfare pensioners and the number of new pensions that would result. In this regard, there are a number of dates from which the scheme might be made operative. If the scheme were backdated to 1953 when the unified system of social insurance was introduced, the estimated cost is &euro;250 million. The question of improvements in the homemaker scheme is something which would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 444, 451 and 452 together.</P>
        <P>The carer&rsquo;s allowance is a social assistance payment that provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. The widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s contributory pension is a social insurance payment and is not means-tested. According to census 2002, there are 48,500 people providing personal care for over four hours per day and just over 24,200 of these are in receipt of either carer&rsquo;s allowance or carer&rsquo;s benefit. This means that 50% of the 48,500 carers, as estimated <Col N="810"/>by the CSO to be caring for more than four hours per day, are in receipt of a specific carer&rsquo;s payment from my Department.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?>
        <P>The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. A number of improvements for carers were announced in the last budget that benefit existing recipients of carer&rsquo;s payments and extend supports to carers who have not previously been eligible for carer&rsquo;s payments. Provision was made for the extension of the respite care grant to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care. This is being implemented from June 2005. The extension includes carers who are providing full-time care and who are either in receipt of a social welfare payment, for example, widow&rsquo;s pensions, old age pensions, one-parent family payment, disability benefit and invalidity pension, or those who are not currently receiving a weekly social welfare payment from my Department. The amount of the grant has increased from &euro;835 to &euro;1,000. Provision has also been made to pay a grant in respect of each care recipient. This will benefit those who provide care for a number of people.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>It was estimated that the improvements in the conditions applying to the respite care grant will result in an additional 9,200 full-time carers receiving the grant for the first time giving an estimated total of almost 33,000 full-time carers receiving the respite care grant of &euro;1,000 in June this year. The cost of these improvements will be over &euro;13.5 million. I will be building on the progress made and continuing to work with my colleagues in Government to develop the type of co-ordinated services which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the programme for Government and in Sustaining Progress, the Government has committed itself to increasing the payment for qualified adults aged 66 or over to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. The estimated cost of this commitment is &euro;44 million. Considerable progress has already been made in this regard with the qualified adult allowance on the contributory payment now standing at &euro;138.50 or 83% of the maximum rate of old age non-contributory pension, cur<Col N="811"/>rently &euro;166.00 per week. Overall increases in the qualified adult allowance on the old age contributory pension amount to &euro;56.47 per week since April 2000. At the same time, the qualified adult allowance on the old age non-contributory pension has increased by &euro;44.05 per week and now stands at 66% of the full personal rate. New pension claimants can opt to have the allowance paid directly to their spouse or partner. The administrative and legislative implications of enhancing these provisions to ensure that more qualified adults can receive a personal payment are being examined and a decision in this regard will be made as soon as possible. Further progress towards Government targets in respect of the qualified adult allowance rate will be made in future budgets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to work allowance scheme is part of my Department&rsquo;s programme of initiatives designed to assist long-term unemployed people, lone parents and other social welfare recipients to return to the active labour force. There are two strands to the scheme, namely, the back to work enterprise allowance for self-employment and the back to work allowance for employees.</P>
        <P>The scheme was reviewed in 2002 in light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the scheme in 1993. In January 2003, the qualifying period on unemployment benefit-assistance was increased to five years. Recipients of other social welfare qualifying payments were not affected by the change. The scheme is continually monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market and economic conditions. It was recognised that there was some difficulty being experienced by persons wishing to enter self-employment after five years attachment to the live register. In budget 2004, the qualifying period was reduced to three years.</P>
        <P>I will continue to monitor the scheme to ensure it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market to gain a foothold into sustainable employment or self-employment and will keep the scheme under review. However, I have no plans to change the qualifying criteria at this time. It is estimated that if the qualifying criteria for access to the enterprise strand of the scheme was reduced from three years to one year, the net <Col N="812"/>costs would be approximately &euro;10.4 million in the first year.</P>

	<P>Given the wide range of charging regimes and cost levels that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State, the introduction of a measure such as an across the board increase in the old age non-contributory pension to address the issue would not be feasible. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements. The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority and a number have in fact done so.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for one-parent family payment in December 2004. To date, the Department is not satisfied that the person has disclosed her means in full. In particular, she has failed to provide confirmation of how renovations to her house will be paid for and the position in respect of a site she owns with a value of &euro;100,000. This information was most recently sought in a letter sent to her on 22 June 2005. On receipt of all the necessary information, a decision will be made on the application and the person concerned will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>

	<P>Since I took up office, I have appointed on a contract basis for my term of office a special adviser, Mr. Frank Lahiffe, a press adviser, Mr. Tom Rowley, a personal secretary, Ms Mary Browne, and a personal assistant, Mr. Bobby Holland. The above named staff were appointed on 30 September 2004. The salaries for these staff are as follows. Special adviser &euro;87,247, which is the principal officer standard scale, press adviser &euro;93,599, which is the principal officer higher scale and personal secretary &euro;38,880. My personal assistant is on secondment from the Department of Education and Science. That Department will recoup from my Department on an annual basis the cost of a replacement teacher&rsquo;s salary, allowances, PRSI contributions and superannuation contributions. This will be approximately &euro;31,800.</P>
        <P>My special adviser and my personal secretary are members of the non-established State <Col N="814"/>employees pension scheme. My personal assistant is a member of the national school teachers superannuation scheme. This Department pays a private pension contribution of 9% of Mr. Rowley&rsquo;s salary. The Deputy should be aware that the number of political appointments made by me compares with 13 made by the Minister for Social Welfare in 1992-97, which included four for the Minister of State in the same period. There is now no Minister of State attached to my Department.</P>

	<P>The Warburg Dillon Read report of December 1999 which was commissioned by my Department in April of that year and which assessed the strategic options at that time for the future of the former Aer Rianta considered, as one of its terms of reference, the question of developing Baldonnel aerodrome for commercial aviation. Copies of that report were provided to the Oireachtas Library in February 2000.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither I nor the Minister of State at the Department of Transport has requested the NRA to carry out traffic modelling in respect of the impact of port tunnel traffic on the M50 and M1. I am aware that arrangements are being put in place to ensure the smooth integration of traffic from the port tunnel into the Dublin road network, particularly at the M1-M50 interchange and in the port area. My Department will keep in touch with the NRA and Dublin City Council so that I may be assured that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the opening of the port tunnel.</P>

	<P>The Department has not spent any money on the services of models for use in promotional activities since it was established in 2002. As regards agencies under the aegis of the Department of Transport, their public relations are part of their day-to-day operations and are a matter for each individual agency.</P>

	<P>Prior to the commencement of Luas services last year, inspectors of my Department satisfied themselves, in accordance with the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, that the infrastructure, trams and safety systems were adequate. My inspectors continue to monitor the safety of Luas operations and take appropriate action as the need arises.</P>
        <P>When enacted, the Railway Safety Bill 2001 will put in place more modernised and strengthened systems for the regulation of railway safety, including the Luas network. This will include the establishment of a railway safety commission to regulate and enforce railway safety and a railway<?oasys _jy?><Col N="835"/><?oasys _fc?>incident investigation unit to investigate railway accidents. I expect to bring this Bill back to the House in the autumn session and have it enacted before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>The maximum working hours and minimum holidays and rest periods of tram drivers are regulated by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. I understand that an employee, or his or her trade union, may appeal to a rights commissioner where there has been a failure to comply with the requirements of the Act.</P>

Part of that programme involves the appropriate refurbishment of rail stations.

When completed, the renovated stations will complement the introduction of fully accessible rail services on this line in 2006.</P>
        <P>I understand that, as part of the rail accessibility programme, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposes to carry out a study to identify the station accessibility needs on the Dublin-Galway line.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 475 together.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in the House on previous occasions, the pension scheme for general employees in Aer Lingus, the Irish airlines general employees superannuation scheme, is a multi-employer scheme which also includes the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and SR Technics, formerly FLS, a private sector company.</P>
        <?oasys _ic20-?><P>I met representatives of the Retired Aviation Staff Association, RASA, on 19 January 2005. The main RASA claim at that time related to salary and CPI indexation of its pensions. As the pensions are being paid in line with the terms of the scheme, there has been no obvious solution to the RASA concerns despite detailed examination over a long period of time. However, I indicated at that meeting that I would ask the companies concerned to keep the matter under review.</P><Col N="838"/>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>In addition to the above mentioned claim, in a recent letter to me, RASA has also stated that in the event of the sale of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus, it wants the Government to underwrite and-or guarantee the pension scheme. It also suggests &ldquo;that when Aer Lingus is sold, the pensioners are entitled to an <i>ex gratia</i> payment for a lifetime of commitment to Aer Lingus for shares they had to sell under law and for shares foregone&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, including Aer Lingus and the DAA, are matters primarily for the trustee, the members of the relevant scheme and the companies involved. The State has no involvement in the funding of these schemes. With regard to the recent Government decision to allow the sale of a majority shareholding in Aer Lingus, it is envisaged that the selected advisers will examine and consider a range of issues concerning Aer Lingus, including its pension schemes.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, the question of an injection of State funds into the pension scheme, from whatever source, does not arise as any such proposal would run counter to established policy in this area and would, in all likelihood, be challenged by the European Commission as a State aid. I should also explain that legislation has been put in place to enable both Aer Lingus and the DAA to establish new pension schemes for their own employees and pensioners. This was provided for in the Aer Lingus Act 2004 and the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998, as amended by the State Airports Act 2004.</P>
        <P>However, it is a matter for the companies concerned to decide if and when a new pension scheme or schemes are to be established and the terms of any such schemes would be a matter for consultation with unions. The normal arrangement where pension schemes of State bodies must be approved by the Minister for Transport, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, will continue to apply. There is no guarantee that RASA&rsquo;s concerns can be addressed in any new schemes that might be established.</P>
        <P>In the event of any new scheme or schemes being established, the Acts referred to above provide that existing pensioners who come within the scope of the scheme will be transferred to the new scheme unless they elect to remain in the existing scheme. The Acts also ensure that the benefits granted under such a new scheme or schemes shall not be less than those granted under the existing scheme.</P>

I understand that investment in national roads in the BMW region up to end-2004 amounted to &euro;1.134 billion &mdash; 70% of that forecast in the NDP &mdash; ESIOP. However, total expenditure on national roads in the BMW region in 2004 was &euro;355 million, an increase of 90% on 2003. Moreover, of the ten national road scheme openings <Col N="842"/>anticipated for 2005, seven are in the BMW region.</P>

Further expenditure in the region is proceeding, resulting in continuous improvements to bus and rail services in the BMW region.</P>
        <P>As evidence of progress to date, all rail lines in the BMW region have now been upgraded to continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers. The resignalling of the Galway-Dublin line has been completed. The Sligo-Dublin line is on target for completion this year and the resignalling of the Ballina and Westport lines will be completed in 2007. At that stage, all rail lines in the BMW region will have been resignalled.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects to take delivery of 36 new modern diesel railcars later this year and <Col N="843"/>most of these are due to be allocated to the Sligo route to replace older rolling stock and to increase frequency and capacity. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann placed an order for a fleet of 120 new high-specification intercity railcars at a cost of &euro;262 million. They will enter service from 2007 onwards and will operate on the Galway, Westport and Ballina routes. At that point, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will be able to provide two-hourly services on the Galway line and increased frequencies on the Westport and Ballina lines.</P>
        <P>In addition, expenditure on projects located outside the region such as the diesel railcar depot at Drogheda and the upgrading and improvement of Heuston Station have benefits for the BMW region. In consultation with the relevant agencies, my Department is, at present, developing a ten-year investment programme for transport. The programme will take account of the public transport needs of all regions of the country and will have regard to the regional planning guidelines recently approved.</P>

	<P>Toll charges on cars increased from 90 cent in 1995 to &euro;1 on 1 January 1996. In accordance with the West Link toll agreement, no payments to the Exchequer became due until average daily traffic volumes exceeded 27,000. The first payment of &euro;3.044 million was reflected in the 1998 appropriation account. User toll charges did not increase over the period 1996 to 1998. Increases in rates payable for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government commercial vehicle test were applied from 1 May 1996 as follows: Vehicles in fee category A increased from £47 to £57; Vehicles in fee category B increased from £37 to £45; Vehicles in fee category C increased from £25 to £30.</P>
        <P>Appropriations-in-aid do not arise in respect of commercial vehicle tests. There were no increases in driving test fees, driving licence fees, road transport licence fees or charges related to bus licensing during the period 1995 to 1998.</P>

	<P>The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is administered by local community and voluntary groups with the support of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on an annual basis.</P>
        <P>To apply for assistance, individuals should contact a local voluntary and community group and request that it make an application on his or her behalf to the Department. A list of approved participating groups in 2004 is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>http://www.pobail.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The scheme provides maximum individual grants of &euro;300 in respect of the once-off installation cost of socially monitored alarms; &euro;150 in respect of door locks, window locks and door chains and &euro;150 in respect of security lighting; and in 2004, I introduced a grant of &euro;50 in respect of smoke alarms. Funding is not available for conventional intruder alarms under this scheme.</P>
        <P>In response to suggestions from older people and their representatives, the 2005 scheme was announced earlier than in recent years. Advertisements were placed in the national and provincial newspapers in the week beginning 11 April 2005. The closing date for applications under the scheme was 24 May, 2005.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 478 to 483, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups addressing disadvantage by way of once-off grants. The programme for 2005 consists of two schemes: one makes funds available for the purchase of essential equipment and for small-scale refurbishment of premises. This is complemented by a second scheme to fund education, training and research initiatives in the community.</P>
        <P>Grants of up to 90% of the cost are available under this scheme. The maximum grant for refurbishment is &euro;40,000 while &euro;10,000 is the limit in respect of the other scheme elements. The move to retrospective payment of grants in excess of &euro;5,000 is to improve accountability in the expenditure of public funds. It should be borne in mind that amounts incurred below the &euro;5,000 threshold will continue to be paid on the basis of subsequent provision of vouched expenditure. Arrangements are being made under the 2005 <Col N="846"/>scheme to expedite payments within a matter of working days to groups who provide valid evidence of incurring eligible expenditure over &euro;5,000. This arrangement reflects good practice and was an area touched on recently by the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 528 and 529 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department, supported by Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each Department to report on progress on the implementation of RAPID and details of funding allocations to the projects that fall within the remit of their own Department.</P>
        <P>However, Departments were asked recently to track funding against specific projects submitted in RAPID plans from each area. While this exercise is still under way, I am informed by ADM that Departments have, to date, reported a spend of &euro;300 million in RAPID areas since the inception of the programme. It should be noted that this amount relates solely to specific projects in RAPID plans and does not include funding to RAPID areas by Departments, which are in addition to the RAPID plans.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the strong support for the RAPID programme. as outlined by the Deputy. I believe that RAPID has an extremely valuable input to make into our society and that the programme should be continued. I cannot identify any specific commitments on funding given at the programme&rsquo;s inception and would appreciate further information from the Deputy with regard to this question.</P>

This is an independent statutory body, under the aegis of my Department, established under the dormant accounts acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the disbursement of up to &euro;60 million from the fund.</P>
        <P>The board has to date approved 482 projects for funding totalling approximately &euro;56.2 million, from the initial allocation of &euro;60 million. In accordance with the board&rsquo;s disbursement plan, the bulk of this funding is initially being targeted at those areas designated as most disadvantaged, i.e. RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and drugs task force areas.</P>
        <P>I understand 184 applications were received in respect of proposals from County Cork and that 59 of these were successful involving approved funding of more than &euro;8 million. A breakdown of these projects, including the grant amounts approved, is provided in the following table.</P><Col N="859"/>

	<P>The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs had not been established during the years in question, having been set up in June 2002. The areas that now constitute this Department were being operated in a variety of Departments over these years.</P>
        <P>It may be of interest to the Deputy that the bulk of appropriations-in-aid receipts currently received by my Department consist of EU payments in respect of the Leader programme, area based rural development and the programme for peace and reconciliation. My Department does not normally receive income from charges, other than those arising under freedom of information requests, the fees for which are determined centrally.</P>
        <P>However, should the Deputy have any particular queries in relation to the charges and appropriations-in-aid receipts of the Department <Col N="862"/>of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I would be glad to have these followed up.</P>

All clear-felling of afforested areas, whether undertaken by private individuals, local authorities or by Coillte Teoranta, are subject to the licensing conditions as laid down under the Forestry Act 1946. Licences are issued following consultation with the various environmental bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service and, if applicable, contain extra conditions to ensure natural habitats for protected species under the Wildlife Act are protected. Any infringements of licence conditions are investigated by my Department and legal pro<Col N="863"/>ceedings are undertaken if considered appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 547 together.</P>
        <P>The directive referred to by the Deputy, directive 2004/28, entered into force with its publication on 30 April 2004. Member states are obliged to transpose this directive into national law by 30 October 2005. My Department is drafting legislation to transpose this directive and it is my intention to meet the 30 October deadline for the transposition.</P>
        <P>With regard to the date of implementation, the majority of the provisions of the directive must be implemented from 30 October. However, as the Deputy is aware, the directive includes an exemption clause to provide a mechanism for <Col N="864"/>specific categories of medicines to be excluded from the mandatory prescription requirement. Decisions at EU level on exemptions are required to be taken by 1 January 2007, pending which existing national distribution arrangements may remain in place.</P>
        <P>With regard to the points raised in the letter from the Competition Authority, I fully accept the need to promote competition in all sectors of the economy. In this regard, my Department proposed certain amendments some time ago as part of a reform of the existing national arrangements and in particular to improve the existing rules relating to veterinary medicines to require provision of prescriptions and to provide for a wider availability at retail level of prescription only medicines, thus stimulating competition and lowering costs. I would intend to include these proposals in the legislation referred to above.</P>
        <P>As regards the points made in the letter relating to the transposition of the EU directive and, in particular, the provisions of the EU directive governing the prescription of veterinary medicines, I should point out that the main objective of the directive in question is to protect human and animal health. In transposing the directive, which sets down specific requirements relating to the prescribing of veterinary medicines, my Department is obliged to take account of the views of bodies such as the FSAI, the Department of Health and Children and the Irish Medicines Board as well as, of course, the views of the Competition Authority and stakeholders. In particular, it is my intention to implement the directive in such a way that it protects public health and animal health and welfare; meets the requirements of relevant EU legislation, in particular, directive 2004/28; does not unnecessarily restrict the availability of veterinary treatments for farmers and others from a cost and animal welfare point of view and in so far as possible fosters competition and reduces the potential for anti-competitive practices by various commercial players; and underpins our export-orientated agriculture and food industries.</P>
        <P>In summary, my intention is to provide for the highest standards of public and animal health protection in this complex area in a way which is workable and which meets relevant EU requirements and underpins our export-orientated agriculture and food industries.</P>

	<P>The position in this case is that the cow declared as the dam of this animal did not have a calf registered to it in the preceding two years. As part of the cross-checking processes for the registration of calf births, where there is an <Col N="865"/>unusual calving interval it is normal practice for the Department to ask the keeper to double check whether the tag number of the dam declared is correct. Thus a query letter was issued to the keeper. Having received the query, the representatives of the keeper should reply to the Sligo district veterinary office to confirm that the dam tag number declared is correct. Registration of the calf can then proceed as normal.</P>

        <P>Having fully examined the circumstances outlined by the person named, my Department was satisfied that <i>force majeure</i> circumstances should apply in this case. Following a careful consideration of both reference periods 1997 to 1999 and 2000 to 2002 it was apparent that the most beneficial position available to the person named was to exclude 2001 and 2002 and to base his single payment entitlements on year 2000 only. This decision was notified to the person named on 20 April 2005.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the European Commission has approved &euro;1.2 million in funding for a promotion programme aimed at increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables in up to 150 Irish primary schools over the next three years. The programme based on a concept known as Food Dude and was prepared by An Bord Bia and recommended by my Department is being implemented under Council Regulation 2826/2000 on funding promotion and information programmes for agricultural products in the European Union.</P>
        <P>This regulation provides that programmes shall be funded 50% by the European Commission, 20% by the member state and 30% by the trade organisation representative of the sector being promoted. Accordingly, the campaign will be co-funded by the European Commission, &euro;600,000, the Department of Agriculture and Food, &euro;240,000, and &euro;360,000 by Wholesale Produce Ireland Limited, a representative body for the fresh produce industry in Ireland. My Department has allocated sufficient funding to cover the member state contribution for the duration of the programme.</P><Col N="867"/>
        <P>The Food Dude programme was developed by researchers at the Bangor food research unit at the University of Wales and is designed to encourage school children to develop a liking and taste for fruit and vegetables. It will do this by means of customised rewards for eating fruit and vegetables, role model encouragement by way of a video, a home pack and both teacher and parental participation to actively encourage continued consumption. The aim is to encourage school children to eat more fruit and vegetables as part of a balanced diet. An Bord Bia will be responsible for overall management of the project and recently concluded a contract with my Department to carry out the measures.</P>

	<P>My Department is still considering the detailed arrangements and requirements for application of the new EU regulations for the transport of animals. Following a process of information exchange and consultation, over the coming months officials in my Department will transpose the EU regulations into national legislation and this process should be completed in early 2006. It should be noted that the new regulations will not come into effect until 5 January 2007, with a small number of provisions only having effect from 1 January 2008 and 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>The main provisions of the EU regulations are the establishment of common detailed rules for the transport of live animals and the registration of transporters of such animals. The provisions do not apply to the transport by farmers of their own animals using their own vehicles for distances up to 50 km. Several other provisions do not apply to persons transporting animals for distances up to 65 km. In addition, the more detailed requirements relating to certificates of competence for drivers and attendants and certificates of approval of vehicles apply only to transport in excess of eight hours.</P>
        <P>In recent years my Department has actively promoted the welfare of animals at all levels, including at farm and transport levels. I welcome the broad thrust of the new EU regulations and I do not expect they will impose significant burdens on the industry. On the other hand, they will significantly improve the welfare of animals during transport and demonstrate the commitment of Ireland and the European Union to animal welfare.</P>

	<P>The regulation on official food and feed controls, OFFC, gives the general rules on <Col N="871"/>controls to prevent, eliminate and reduce risks to human and animal health. The controls stipulated within the regulation are to guarantee fair practices in the food and feed trade.</P>
        <P>Member states&rsquo; responsibility to ensure business operators apply EU legislation correctly is clearly defined. The regulation defines the role of the Commission&rsquo;s food and veterinary office, FVO, as auditor of the member states&rsquo; performance. Performance criteria are introduced for the competent authorities of member states and a harmonised EU-wide approach to the design and development of control systems is also set out.</P>
        <P>The regulation on OFFC also provides a framework to support developing countries in meeting EU import requirements and to enable the Commission to fund activities that enhance food and feed safety. It establishes a common regime for controls on food and feed imports, basing the nature and frequency of controls on the basis of risk.</P>
        <P>Another regulation establishes the hygiene requirements for animal feed. It completes the &ldquo;farm to fork&rdquo; approach, providing rules on the production, transport, storage and handling of animal feed. It also introduces the liability of feed operators to pay for the costs, such as withdrawal from the market and destruction of feed, if something goes wrong with their feed as a result of infringements of the feed safety legislation.</P>
        <P>In relation to the elements of work that come within the remit of my Department, statutory instruments are being drafted to give effect, where necessary, to this legislation.</P>

	<P>The hygiene package is one of the key elements of the consolidation and updating of the EU&rsquo;s food safety legislation. It is composed of five regulations-directives covering general hygiene, hygiene of foodstuffs of animal origin, official controls and animal health rules for products of animal origin intended for human consumption, and a directive repealing the previously existing legislation. The main elements of the regulations cover, <i>inter alia</i>, the responsibility of the food business operators, the registration and the official approval of premises, the controls to be put in place by the national competent authorities and specific training requirements for both operators and official agency staff.</P>
        <P>These measures cover all food business operators throughout the food chain from farmer to retailer. Accordingly the controls involved are operated by a number of Departments and official agencies in Ireland.</P><Col N="872"/>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that EU Directive 95/69/EC, as transposed into Irish legislation by SI 88 of 1999, provides for control measures in the area of production, transport, storage and handling of animal feed. This legislation has now been strengthened significantly with the introduction of EU Regulation 183/2005 which lays down additional rules for feed hygiene. The majority of this new regulation will come into effect on 1 January 2006.</P>
        <P>The new legislation, which complements both Regulation 178/2002 on the general principles in food law and Regulation 882/2004 on official feed and food controls requires all feed businesses, including primary producers &mdash; farmers &mdash; to be either registered or approved, depending on their activities; operators, other than farmers at the level of primary production, to implement HACCP measures; the development, dissemination and use of guides to good practices to be encouraged in the feed sector; and the question of introducing financial guarantees for withdrawal from the market and destruction of affected food or feed to be explored.</P>
        <P>The new legislation will ensure that the application of the existing registration and approval system is extended across the whole feed sector and consequently the concept of full traceability is greatly enhanced.</P>
        <P>My Department is preparing the necessary legislation and registration forms to ensure the new provisions come into effect on 1 January 2006.</P>

	<P>An application for consideration under the <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances measure of the single payment regulations was submitted by the person named on 27 October 2004.</P>
        <P>Following a full examination of the circumstances put forward, the person named was informed on 25 January 2005 that the circum<Col N="873"/>stances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances under article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. While it is accepted that <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances did occur on the farm of the person named as a result of a BSE de-population, the single payment unit decision was based on the fact that he was not an applicant under the special beef, bull, suckler cow, ewe premium or arable aid schemes during the reference years 2000 to 2002. As such his production relative to the single payment scheme was not affected by the events outlined.</P>
        <P>A statement of provisional entitlements issued to the person named on 12 April 2005, indicating that he has 18.73 entitlements with a total net value of &euro;990.44. These entitlements relate to the slaughter premium scheme following de-population.</P>
        <P>The person named also submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category C which caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.</P>
        <P>In excess of 17,200 applications have been received under the national reserve at the Department&rsquo;s office in Castlebar and are being processed at present. In view of the number of applications received and the documentation submitted, it will be some time before a decision is reached on whether the person named is entitled to an allocation from the reserve.</P>
        <P>He will of course be notified of his eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.</P>

	<P>I have raised the issue of the breach of our national ceiling under the 2004 special beef premium scheme on a number of occasions with the EU Agriculture Commissioner, most recently during her visit here last week. I have put the case strongly that the overshoot arose as a result of the changeover to full de-coupling with effect from 1 January 2005. My officials have also prepared and supplied to the Commission services detailed submissions on all aspects of the overshoot and have met directly with Commission services officials on a number of occasions to further press our case. During the recent visit to Ireland, the Commissioner indicated that she understood the problem and intended to make an early decision.</P>

	<P>I have raised the issue of the breach of our national ceiling under the 2004 special beef premium scheme on a number of occasions with the EU Agriculture Commissioner, most recently during her visit here last week. I have put the case strongly that the overshoot arose as a result of the changeover to full decoupling with effect from 1 January 2005. My officials have also prepared and supplied to the Commission services, detailed submissions on all aspects of the overshoot and have met directly with Commission services officials on a number of occasions to further press our case.</P>

	<P>The person named applied on 35 animals under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme. A cross-check with the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, in October 2000 showed that five of the animals applied on were disposed of during the retention period for the scheme. Clause 22 of the terms and conditions governing the scheme in 2000 required an applicant to notify my Department of replacement details within ten days of the event. The person named failed to do so and was advised by letter of 23 October 2000 that the five animals were rejected from his application and that a reduction penalty would apply to the payment on his remaining animals. He was given the opportunity to appeal and a letter was received by my Department on 5 December 2000 in which the herd owner provided details of the replacement animals.</P>
        <P>To verify the eligibility of these replacements an inspection was carried out on his herd on 30 January 2001. It was found during this inspection that a total of 16 animals applied on had been disposed of during the retention period for the scheme and that, while they had been replaced, no notification of seven of these replacements had been received by my Department, contravening clause 22 of the terms and conditions of the 2000 scheme. As the number of rejected animals exceeded 20% of the remaining eligible animals, no suckler cow premium could be paid for the 2000 scheme year. The applicant was informed of <Col N="879"/>this by letter on 26 April 2001 and was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed.</P>
        <P>On receipt of a written request for a review, the case was examined again by my Department and the decision to refuse the premia for 2000 was upheld. In the course of this review, it was also found that only 19 cows had calved in this herd over the previous 12 months, representing a low calving rate of just over 50%. In a letter issued on 11 July 2001 the person named was informed that the decision to refuse payment of the 2000 suckler cow premium was upheld and was told of his right to appeal the decision to the appeals unit. No further appeal was made.</P>
        <P>No application was received by my Department under the 2001 suckler cow scheme, as the person named had sold his suckler cow quota.</P>

The first application, in respect of 15 animals, was received on 20 December 2004, the second application, in respect of 13 animals, was received on 24 December 2004 and the third application, in respect of two animals, was received on 6 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The advance payments and the interim balancing payments in respect of the three applications have already issued to the person named.

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <Quest>if the ownership of Irish sugar beet quota has been determined; the identity of the owner of the quota; if this issue has not been resolved, the reason for the delay; when a decision will be reached; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer here. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts <Col N="880"/>with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.</P>
        <P>Ownership of the sugar quota had never been an issue in the past because the relevant EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. Speculation about quota ownership only arose when the Commission, in July of last year, raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility, in the context of its initial thinking on reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, voiced strong opposition to the idea of cross-border quota mobility and I am pleased to say that it does not form part of the Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposals for sugar reform which were published last week. However, I had already asked the Attorney General to examine the quota ownership issue. I am not aware of when this examination will be completed but I will, of course, be guided by the Attorney General on any legal issues relating to the quota that emerge in the course of the forthcoming negotiations on the Commission&rsquo;s proposals.</P>

        <Quest>the person on whose instructions inspectors of her Department visited farmers in County Galway prior to EU audit inspections of those same files and farms; her views on whether it is appropriate conduct for such inspectors to be involved in preparing REP scheme farm records for those farms; if she is satisfied that such records were accurate; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Before a recent audit of the rural environment protection scheme, European Commission auditors chose more than 50 files for audit. On their arrival, they selected a number of these for farm visits. In these cases they also wished to observe full plan-checks and on-farm inspection procedures carried out by my officials. The auditors indicated that my Department could notify the farmers of the on-farm inspections in advance as I understand that their audit brief included an interview with the REPS beneficiaries about their participation in the scheme. Apart from offering advice, my officials do not involve themselves in the preparation of records; this is a matter for the farmer.</P>
        <P>At any stage during an audit, other files not specified in advance may be requested for audit scrutiny. My Department always facilitates such requests and works closely with European Union and other external audit bodies to ensure the control systems in place to protect national and EU financial interests are robust.</P>

	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention, in the event of industrial action by the Prison Officers Association, to deploy members of both the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to the prisons as necessary. Training of personnel from both services in the running of the prisons has been undertaken. Clearly I would prefer to avoid this eventuality. However, given the current circumstances, it would be foolish of me to ignore the possibility of industrial action in the prisons. Clearly such action would represent a threat to the security of the State and the Government must be prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect the safety and security of our prisons.</P>

	<P>Prison officers voted to reject the proposal for organisational change in the prison service by a majority of about two to one.</P>
        <P>I cannot offer an explanation why the proposal was rejected despite a strong recommendation for acceptance by the national executive council of <Col N="882"/>the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association. By any standards, the deal on offer was extremely attractive. It included a pensionable operational allowance equivalent to 8% of basic pay and lump sum payments amounting to &euro;13,750 per officer, in return for the level of change envisaged. Under the deal, a basic grade prison officer would have potentially earned almost &euro;70,000 per year at the top of the scale.</P>
        <P>Despite the reservations I held about the deal that emerged, which were shared by the Minister for Finance and the rest of my colleagues in Government, I nevertheless accepted that the overall package represented a workable way forward for the future.</P>
        <P>The main benefit to the taxpayer would have been a significant reduction in the bill for additional hours working in the prison service, predictable future costs and a more efficient service going into the future. At the same time, staff would have secured attractive, stable and predictable overall rates of remuneration.</P>
        <P>As regards the proposal from the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association for a cost neutral realignment of the additional hours bands which are a central feature of the proposal for organisational change, I have already explained to the House in some detail the reasons for my decision to reject those proposals. I refer the Deputy to my answer to question Nos. 21320/05 and 21465/05 of 23 June. In my response, I set out my main objection to the Prison Officer&rsquo;s Association proposals, namely, that they would, if accepted, fundamentally alter the deal which was on the table and consequently they would seriously compromise the integrity of the industrial relations machinery, in particular the arbitration process.</P>
        <P>I will not be led down the path of renegotiating an agreement which has already been arbitrated upon as to do so would be to undermine a process which has served the State well for many years. I have no option now but to move ahead, with or without agreement, to implement whatever measures are required to realise the necessary cost efficiencies in the service.</P>
        <P>As I have already indicated to the House, I have invited the Prison Officer&rsquo;s Association to meet me so that I can outline in detail my plans for the future.</P>

	<P>The person concerned is the subject of a deportation order made on 20 January 2003. He has instituted judicial review proceedings challenging that order. The issue raised, i.e., the subsequent marriage to an Irish national of a person who is the subject of a deportation order, has already been raised in a precedent judicial review case which is likely to be heard by the Supreme Court in the autumn. The outcome of the case which is the subject of this question is likely to be determined by that Supreme Court judgment.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the person concerned has filed a separate application for residency based on parentage of an Irish-born child under the revised arrangements for the consideration of permission to remain in respect of non-national parents of children born in Ireland before 1 January 2005. As the child was born in February 2005 that application fails to meet the criteria for the granting of permission to remain under those revised arrangements.</P>

	<P>The application in question was for the stated purpose of allowing a non-EEA national travel to the State to assist a family member, resident here on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child and due to undergo a medical procedure, to care for her children.</P>
        <P>I understand this application was received on 5 April 2005. Following assessment of the application it was determined that additional documentation would be required. Attempts were made, commencing on 27 April 2005, to contact the applicant via the Irish Embassy in her country of origin, however these attempts proved unsuccessful.</P>
        <P>Consequently, it was necessary to proceed to a decision based on the documentation to hand. As a result, the visa application was refused by my <Col N="885"/>Department on 22 June 2005. The visa officer, having regard to the information available to him, was unable to conclude that the applicant had sufficient obligations to return home following the proposed visit, or that she would necessarily observe the conditions of the visa applied for.</P>
        <P>Additionally, a full copy of the applicant&rsquo;s passport was not supplied, nor was up to date documentary evidence of suitable financial means of either the applicant or her reference in the State.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 578, 581 and 593 together.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Childcare Committee is one of the 33 city-county child care committees, CCCs, established as part of the quality sub-measure of the equal opportunities child care programme in order to promote better co-ordination and enhanced quality for the child care sector. As with all the CCCs, Dublin City Childcare Committee was tasked to develop a five year, locally focused child care strategy and was advised that it could expect an annual funding budget of between &euro;292,000 and &euro;318,500 to meet the costs of delivering the strategy through a pre-agreed series of annual action plans. Unlike the other CCCs, the Dublin City Childcare Committee opted to put in place a devolved administrative structure with five separate centres and sought additional funds under the EOCP for this purpose. It contracted out one such administrative structure in respect of which initial and additional funding of &euro;125,000 was provided to cover a 15 month period. A further grant of &euro;100,000 was provided for the same purpose in 2005. At the <Col N="886"/>same time, the level of core funding provided to the Dublin City Childcare Committee to deliver its 2005 action plan was increased to &euro;344,000 making a total of &euro;444,000 available to the Dublin City Childcare Committee for its core activities in 2005 &mdash; an increase of some 39% above its earlier upper indicative budget. In addition to this core funding Dublin City Childcare Committee has also received considerable funding to enable it to offer a programme of supports for the development of child minders.</P>
        <P>I understand three local child care resource centres have already been established by the Dublin Committee in Dublin North-Central, Dublin North-West and Dublin South-Central and that the committee would wish to establish two more and are seeking an increase in its funding. This request is still under active consideration in my Department.</P>
        <P>Pending the conclusion of this review, it would be premature of me to comment further on the matter at this time.</P>

	<P>The Garda mountain bike unit was introduced on a pilot basis, on 5 June 2001, in the Tallaght and Raheny Garda districts of the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR. In February 2002 a review conducted by the Garda authorities found that the deployment of Garda personnel on mountain bikes has proven to be successful in tackling and responding to certain types of offences.</P>
        <P>Since that time the Garda mountain bike unit has been expanded both inside and outside the <Col N="887"/>Dublin metropolitan region. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that approval has recently been given by Garda management for the establishment of a mountain bike unit in Terenure district. The training of selected personnel will begin in the near future and following the successful completion of this, and allocation of the necessary equipment, the unit will become operational.</P>
        <P>Mountain bike units have been very successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in local parks and estates and work well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the units have proven to be very successful to date due to their commitment, ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence.</P>
        <P>Mountain bike units have made a significant and positive contribution to a proactive approach in tackling crime. Garda management have received very positive feedback from the community on the work of these units.</P>

	<P>In relation to crime figures the Deputy will be aware that on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I arranged for the publication of headline crime statistics on a quarterly basis in order to improve the quality of information available to the public. While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to six per 1,000 over the longer period of eleven quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. In interpreting these fig<Col N="888"/>ures, account has also to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that proceedings commenced for 292,279 non-headline offences in 2003 and for 282,065 non-headline offences in 2004. Further details of non-headline offences are available in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na annual report for 2003.</P>

        <P>As the Deputy is aware, I previously gave a commitment to abolish the use of old-style padded cells in our prisons. An implementation group set up in the prison service to determine the most appropriate design for future special observation cells and other related matters has completed its deliberations. A total of six cells based on two different designs recommended by the implementation group have been completed and are in use in Cloverhill Prison. Work is also at an advanced stage on modifications in line with the recommendations in Mountjoy Prison, Castlerea Prison and St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. Further work will take place in the other prisons on a phased basis continuing into next year.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation by the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department in January 2003.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State before the date of the application and a total of four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight years preceding that period. For the purposes of calculating this residency, no period may be reckoned in respect of which a non-national either was required to have the permission of the <Col N="892"/>Minister to remain in the State but did not have such permission, or had permission to remain for the purpose of study or for the purpose of seeking to be recognised as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996. As the applicant entered the State in April 1999, she did not fulfil the above mentioned statutory residency criteria at the date of her application.</P>

	<P>Mexican nationals are not subject to a visa requirement for the purposes of travel to this jurisdiction. However such persons require permission to remain from an immigration officer at a port or airport. Such permission is normally forthcoming in the case of a Mexican national who wishes to make a short term visit to the State provided the person has the resources to maintain him/herself fully for the duration of that visit.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the information supplied by the Deputy it would appear that the woman to whom he refers has a different problem. The person does not wish to visit the State &mdash; she wants permission to reside in the State. However she is not able to maintain herself fully without recourse to employment and cannot secure employment unless an employer is in a position to acquire an employment permit from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on her behalf.</P>
        <P>It is open to her to seek entry for employment purposes under the work permit scheme or under the working visa-work authorisation scheme.</P>
        <P>This case raises a wider and complex issue regarding the circumstances in which persons should be allowed to come and reside here. While the case raised by the Deputy certainly comes within the ambit of that issue, I am sure that he would agree that it is dangerous to contemplate policy change on the basis of one individual type of case.</P>
        <P>However my recently published discussion document, Immigration and Residence in Ireland <Col N="893"/>&mdash; Outline Policy Proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill, contains a comprehensive analysis of such issues as admission for the purposes of work, admission for the purposes of family reunification and the issue of long-term residency status. It situates these contemporary challenges for Irish society in an analysis of the current Irish system, international practice and proposals for change. The document is intended to stimulate public debate and inform contributions to the planned Immigration and Residence Bill.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year, the Commission for the Location of Victim&rsquo;s Remains submitted its third report to both Governments. In response, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Right Honourable Peter Hain, MP and I wrote a joint letter to the commission proposing the appointment of a forensic sciences consultant to conduct a review of the searches to date and an evaluation if more could now be done. That person would also be available to receive further information in relation to the location of remains should this become available.</P>
        <P>The key to the recovery of the remains lies within the republican movement, and while I am aware of public comments by Sinn F&eacute;in representatives in recent weeks, I obviously cannot say if reliable further information about the location of remains will be forthcoming.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I received a response from the commission which has indicated its satisfaction with the review, in principle and I expect a suitably qualified person to be appointed shortly.</P>
        <P>I am deeply aware of the long-standing anxiety and suffering of the families of the disappeared and I do not wish to add anything that might create unrealistic expectations at this stage, especially in light of the fact that thorough searches of vast amounts of land have taken place unsuccessfully previously. Both Governments remain committed to doing all that is in their power to assist and support the families concerned.</P>

        <P>The programme funding has been increased in a series of steps from &euro;318 million originally allocated to the present funding package of &euro;499 million and the Government has already committed to continue to fund child care development in the post-2006 period.</P>
        <P>The programme has already created more than 24,600 new child care places and a further 15,300 will be brought to completion with funding already committed under the programme.</P>
        <P>The 33 city-county child care committees were established, and are resourced, under the EOCP, with a total allocation of about &euro;7.6 million for all 33 in 2005 to meet the core activities which are pre-agreed with the Department and which must link in with the five year locally focused child care strategy developed by each county. The committees receive additional funding for new initiatives such as the development of childminding and the work which they will shortly undertake to enhance the supply of school age child care. In addition to their work on the delivery of their child care strategies, the county committees also review all applications made for grant assistance under the EOCP and advise on local child care needs.</P>
        <P>The following tables detail funding allocated to city and county child care committees under the EOCP. It does not include the additional funding to be made available for the development of school age child care.</P>

        <Quest>further to Parliamentary Question No. 83 of 1 June 2004, the progress that has been made in relation to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities; the position of the Government on the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the General Assembly of the United Nations established an <i>ad hoc</i> committee, AHC, to consider proposals for a UN Convention to promote and protect the dignity and rights of persons with disabilities. At the second meeting of this committee in June 2003, it was decided to set up a working group to prepare a draft convention for consideration by the AHC. The working group met in January 2004 and prepared a draft.</P>
        <P>This draft was considered by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on three occasions since, at its third session in May-June 2004, its fourth session in August-September 2004 and at its fifth session in January-February 2005. At the May 2004 meeting and during the first week of the August 2004 meeting, UN member states set out their positions on each article in turn and non-governmental organisations were given the opportunity to comment.</P>
        <P>During the second week of the August 2004 meeting, the committee started a line-by-line examination of the text. This work continued at the AHC&rsquo;s meeting in January of this year and will be continued at the next meeting of the committee in August next.</P>
        <P>During these negotiations, the differences between UN member states on individual paragraphs are being narrowed; areas of consensus are being identified and matters requiring further negotiation are also being highlighted. This work is taking place on the basis that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, EU member states co-ordinate their positions on the draft text of the convention on an ongoing basis, with the EU position being presented to the <i>ad hoc</i> committee by the EU Presidency. Ireland is working with our partners to develop common EU negotiating positions that find acceptance with all EU member states. Further meetings of the committee will be required. It is likely to be sometime before the text of a convention, acceptable to all UN member states, has been agreed.</P>

        <P>As I stated in my previous reply on this matter, in Parliamentary Question No. 465 on 22 March 2005, in making a decision on an application for compensation under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945, my Department has, in accordance with section 6 (1)<i>(b)</i> of the 1941 Act, regard to all the relevant facts including the reports from the Garda authorities and the Garda chief medical officer, setting out the background to the case and the precise nature of the injuries sustained.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in this case, the length of time taken to process the application has arisen primarily in relation to consideration of the medical aspects of the case. I am informed that the required medical reports having been submitted on behalf of the applicant, including a report giving the final prognosis on the member&rsquo;s condition, and the reports having been considered by the Garda CMO, that an appointment with the CMO was arranged for 6 April. I am further informed that the Garda authorities forwarded a report in the matter to my Department on 24 June. A decision on the member&rsquo;s application will be made without any undue delay.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, Ennis is one of 17 locations nationwide selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme <Col N="903"/>of implementation of CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">Phase 1 &mdash; Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick</P>
        <P LI="1">Phase 2 &mdash; Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford</P>
        <P LI="1">Phase 3 &mdash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo</P>
        <P LI="1">Phase 1 has been completed in five of the six locations.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Installation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process and the Garda authorities have been giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard. I believe that the proposed redesign of the tender document provides an opportunity to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest possible extent, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. In that regard I asked the Commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the eleven locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations, including Ennis, by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>As a first step in this process the Garda authorities have placed a request for tender document on the Government e-tenders website seeking tenders for consultancy services for the procurement, supply and implementation of town centre CCTV systems to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. A total of six tender proposals have been received and are currently being evaluated.</P>
        <P>To procure the most rapid delivery of these systems, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is endeavouring to establish the most appropriate procurement model available. This process will involve the successful tenderer examining all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including:</P>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>The installation, operation and management of systems.</P>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>Monitoring, recording and related activities.</P>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>Accommodation and situation of facilities and staff in relation to the town scheme and Garda station premises.</P>
        <P el="5">
          <?oasys _is0p10-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>Assessment of civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The successful tenderer must also examine and recommend which procurement model is considered to be the most suitable in terms of commercial viability and cost effectiveness for the provision of town centre CCTV systems. It is the <Col N="904"/>ambition of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to maximise outsourcing of all processes in making Garda town centre CCTV systems available in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 600, 601 and 616 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 20 fixed camera installation posts at various locations in the Dublin area and the Louth-Meath division. There are three cameras rotated between these fixed camera installation posts. I am also informed by the Garda that there is a range of mobile speed detection equipment, including six GATSO vans &mdash; a mobile unit with on board cameras, radar, and computer system &mdash; in operation throughout the State. There is also currently in use by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na laser speed detection equipment, including hand held speed detection devices and car-motor cycle systems.</P>
        <P>The Government road safety strategy for the period 2004-06 proposes that 11.1 million vehicle speeding checks be carried out per year by the end of the strategy. To enable this target to be achieved, the strategy proposes that the Garda <Col N="905"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na enter into arrangements for the engagement of a private sector concern for the purpose of the provision and operation of a nationwide programme for the detection of speeding offences. The strategy makes clear that the overall performance criteria to be applied to the outsourced detection of speeding offences would be determined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and camera detection facilities would be used at locations where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na determines there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. Because of the characteristics of the State&rsquo;s road network, the use of mobile cameras is the most practical approach, although the use of fixed cameras may be relevant at a small number of locations.</P>
        <P>A working group chaired by my Department and consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority has reported to me and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, on how the provision, operation and processing of the output of speed cameras might operate. We expect to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a key recommendation of the strategic review was that a new position of Assistant Commissioner in charge of all aspects of road traffic law should be created. In February of this year, the Government approved the appointment of Eddie Rock as Assistant Commissioner and the Commissioner appointed him to take charge of the traffic corps. Never before has the enforcement of road traffic law been given this level of priority within the force. The new Assistant Commissioner is a member of the top management team in the force and he will bring authority and visible leadership to the traffic corps from the outset.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>if he will provide the resources to increase the number of juvenile liaison officers in County Wexford to the level that each Garda district has one full-time officer; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that there are currently three juvenile liaison officers appointed in the Wicklow-Wexford division and they are assigned to Wexford, New Ross and Arklow Garda stations. I am further informed that during 2004 the juvenile liaison officers in the Wicklow-Wexford division dealt with 574 referrals.</P>
        <P>Local Garda management is satisfied with the number of juvenile liaison officers currently available in County Wexford. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing needs of County Wexford with a view to ensuring the maintenance of an effective policing service.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Wexford-Wicklow division will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>The visa applications referred to by the Deputy were for the purposes of allowing two non-EEA nationals travel to the State for a short-term visit. Application number 1760456 was refused by my Department on 23 March 2005. The second application, application number 1760457, was refused by my Department on 29 March 2005.</P>
        <P>In assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa, for example, it is unlikely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in his or her country of origin. Both of the applications in question were refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicants <Col N="910"/>had not displayed evidence of their obligations to return home following the proposed visit. Additionally, in the case of application number 1760456, the visa officer concluded, on the basis of the documentation supplied, that the applicant did not have appropriate financial means to enable her support herself during the proposed visit.</P>
        <P>Although it was open to the applicants to appeal, within two months of receipt of the refusal decision, my Department has no record of any such appeal in respect of these applications having been received. As the timeframe for submission of an appeal has now passed, the applicants should submit fresh applications should they still wish to travel.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 611 and 612 together.</P>
        <P>The question of the extension of the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal to cover the tragic event in question was raised by the person concerned and by Members of the House around the time of the establishment of the tribunal. I also understand that it was the subject of a request under the Freedom of information Act which was dealt with in accordance with the provisions of that Act.</P>
        <P>At the time I indicated that the circumstances surrounding the fire, including matters referred to in the letter from the person concerned, were raised at the time of the original investigation and that no evidence of criminality was found. The person concerned and the Deputies who made representations on his behalf were told that if he had further new information or additional material in his possession, this should be made available to the Garda authorities or to the Garda Complaints Board to whom any complaint about the manner in which the Garda investigation was conducted should ordinarily be addressed.</P>
        <P>With regard to any extension of the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal, the position is that the existing terms of reference were adopted by the Houses of the Oireachtas as both definite, as required by the legislation, and comprehensive and are based on the recommendations of Mr. Shane Murphy, SC. It is not proposed to seek to extend them at this stage but it is open to the tribunal to seek an extension if it believes that <Col N="912"/>the existing terms of reference constrain it from inquiring into a related definite matter of public importance.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation by the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department in February 2003.</P>
        <P>Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that an applicant for naturalisation must have a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State before the date of the application and a total of four year&rsquo;s residence in the State in the eight years preceding that period. For the purposes of calculating this residency, no period may be reckoned in respect of which a non-national either was required to have the permission of the Minister to remain in the State but did not have such permission or had permission to remain for the purpose of study or for the purpose of seeking to be recognised as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.</P>
        <P>The applicant was deemed to be ineligible for naturalisation as she did not have five years&rsquo; reckonable residence in the State at the date of her application, and as a result did not meet the above mentioned statutory criteria.</P>
        <P>Officials in the citizenship section have been in correspondence with the person concerned and I understand the contents of a letter from her are being considered at present and that a reply will issue very shortly.</P>

	<P>The position with regard to the payment of travel and subsistence to the staff concerned was set out in my replies to Questions Nos. 198 and 199 on 16 June 2004. I indicated that the payment of travel and subsistence is governed by the provisions of Department of the Public Service Circular 11/82. It is a matter for each Department to determine whether it would be appropriate to make travel and subsistence payments to their staff in any particular situation.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, in relation to temporary transfers from the Curragh, it was decided that subsistence payments relating to breakfast, dinner or tea allowances would not be paid as the costs of same would normally be incurred by the officer in any event. Furthermore, mileage expenses were to be at the lower rate and the payment of this was reviewed on a regular basis. For the purposes of clarification, where an officer travels from home to the prison of temporary transfer, she or he will qualify for mileage, at the lower rate, based on the lesser of the distance from home to the prison of temporary transfer or the distance from his or her normal prison to the prison of temporary transfer, except that if any part of the journey from home to the prison of temporary transfer covers part of the usual route from home to his or her normal prison, this portion will not qualify for payment of mileage, that is, mileage is only payable for that part of the journey after the officer leaves his or her normal route to work to his or her normal prison.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Garda authorities the category of &ldquo;pistol-revolver&rdquo; on the crime recording system is broad and captures different types of pistols and revolvers including starting pistols, air pistols, antique pistols and flare pistols. Starting pistols, antique pistols and flare pistols do not require a firearm certificate for possession, use or carriage. Where an air pistol falls under the definition of a firearm con<Col N="914"/>tained in the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 a firearm certificate is required for possession, use or carriage.</P>
        <P>With regard to the figures relating to pistols the six pistols-revolvers stolen in 2002 refer to starting pistols, flare pistols and air pistols. There were two antique revolvers stolen in 2002 and both had the barrel bored and the hammer filed down to render them incapable of firing. The 17 pistols-revolvers stolen in 2003 refer to air pistols, starting pistols and starting revolvers. There was one revolver stolen in 2003 which had been rendered incapable of firing. The pistols-revolvers stolen in 2004 were two air pistols.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the information in relation to firearms stolen in 2002, 2003 and 2004, which are legally held by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Defence Forces, is not readily available but is currently being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Killucan Garda station as at 24 June 2005 was one garda.</P>
        <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 263 of 18 May 2005, it is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division.</P>
        <P>I am advised that cognisance is taken of retirements, etc., during each allocation of probationer garda&iacute;, and that the needs of the Longford-Westmeath division will be fully considered during future allocations of probationer garda&iacute; and, where possible, by way of permanent transfer of members to the division.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these <Col N="915"/>additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Longford-Westmeath division will be fully considered in the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has not received formal applications for transfer to this country under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons in respect of these persons.</P>
        <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons requires extensive documentation to be exchanged between both jurisdictions to allow an application to be fully considered. A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, that is, from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned. On receipt of those consents, assuming they will be forthcoming, an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.</P>
        <P>These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 and must be adhered to in processing each application.</P>

	<P>Under Section 6(2) of the Censorship of Films Act 1923, it is an offence to knowingly exhibit in public a film in the presence of any person who is not a member of the class in whose presence such a film is authorised to be exhibited. The staff of the film censor&rsquo;s office includes an inspector, one of whose duties includes visiting cinemas to ensure compliance with the aforementioned Act. Should the Deputy have specific examples of offences having been committed he should bring them to the attention of the relevant authorities.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns about certain films being made available in video shops, following their certification for public display, the position is that no film shall be exhibited in public in the first instance, unless it is certified as fit for <Col N="917"/>public examination by the film censor. While independent in the exercise of his official functions, the relevant legislation provides for the prohibition of films where the film censor forms the opinion that such a film or part thereof is unfit for general exhibition by reason of its being obscene or blasphemous or because its exhibition in public would be subversive of public morality.</P>
        <P>The legislation does not provide for an appeal by a member of the general public against a certification decision in respect of a particular film. However, the film censor has in place a range of mechanisms which enable parents and others to express their views on film classification and certification.</P>
        <P>These include: the holding of regular focus group consultations &mdash; comprising parents, educators, students, psychologists, psychiatrists, other experts and representative organisations, for example, the National Parents Council; the establishment of a website, <i>www.ifco.ie</i>, which I launched on 3 September, 2004 and which provides consumer advice to parents on the content of every film; and a major national survey of parents carried out by Lansdowne Market Research as well as a survey on adolescent attitudes to film classification.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be interested in the results of the survey of parents, in which two out of three parents said they regularly agreed with the film censor&rsquo;s classification. Of the one in three who said that they sometimes disagree with the classifications, a majority felt that they were too strict.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the weapon in question, which was never claimed, was destroyed, together with other weaponry, in July 2000, as the storage site &mdash; Clancy Barracks &mdash; had been sold. In this regard, when cases are finalised in the courts or if no charges are preferred, items such as this are returned to the Garda technical bureau, unless there is a court order to say otherwise.</P>
        <P>I am further informed that there will be no criminal proceedings taken in relation to this weapon. I do not consider it appropriate to comment on the other aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, as they are of an operational nature.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government&rsquo;s overall policy to tackle the drug problem is set out in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Building on Experience, and responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the strategy lies with my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Under the current national strategy, which sets out a framework for action for the period 2001-2008, drugs policy is being delivered across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the Government has become increasingly aware of an increase in the use of cocaine in Ireland and the need to put in place appropriate interventions. The Government remains fully committed to addressing the misuse of all illegal drugs, including cocaine, in the context of the national drugs strategy, and it continues to invest significant funding towards tackling the drug problem.</P>
        <P>Specifically as regards cocaine, last November the Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy allocated &euro;400,000 to fund a number of pilot training, education and treatment initiatives targeted at addressing cocaine. This funding is intended to build on the valuable work already done in this area by the health authorities and community based projects in local drugs task force areas. It is expected that these pilot initiatives will play an important part in broadening our knowledge of how best to continue to tackle the problem of cocaine misuse.</P>
        <P>Regarding supply reduction, actions by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include: conducting intelligence driven operations at criminal networks involved in the sale and supply of cocaine; working in partnership with other law enforcement agencies, both nationally and internationally, to reduce the supply of cocaine into the state; and conducting targeted operations in locations where cocaine supply and distribution are believed to occur.</P>
        <P>These actions have led to an increase in the number of cocaine seizures and the volume of cocaine seized.</P>

Upon arrival, the person was processed, subjected to a search and placed in a cell in accordance with standard procedures The person was checked in his cell by the Garda on duty on five occasions, and nothing unusual was found.</P>
        <P>When the Garda on duty next went to the cell, the person was found hanging from a ligature <Col N="920"/>around his neck, which was suspended from a permanent fixture in the cell. The ligature used was the cord from the waist band of the person&rsquo;s tracksuit. The person was taken down, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was commenced and an ambulance was called. The procedure continued until the arrival of Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance personnel and the person was conveyed to hospital. The person concerned currently remains in intensive care.</P>
        <P>The cell area was sealed off and an investigation into the circumstances of this incident immediately commenced. A superintendent from outside the division has been appointed to oversee this investigation, which is ongoing</P>

	<P>On 10 March last the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination did not issue a judgment imposing an obligation on the Irish State to promote the establishment of multidenominational schools. Rather the committee encouraged Ireland to promote the establishment of non-denominational or multidenominational schools.</P>
        <P>The committee recommended that this matter be addressed along with all other observations made when Ireland submits its third and fourth periodic reports by January 2008. My Department will furnish its response on this specific observation as part of that wider reporting by Ireland requested by the committee.</P>
        <P>As regards annual funding for Educate Together, the group which promotes the development of multidenominational schools, the position is that my Department is currently engaged in discussions with this group in relation to this matter. The provision of some additional funding in 2005, to meet the immediate issues of concern to Educate Together, is under discussion along with their longer term needs. The current level of funding that my Department provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.</P>
        <P>As regards support for the establishment of new multidenominational schools, it should be noted that the Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage. The Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for state-owned school buildings, which had cost up to &euro;63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster- such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan which was designed and built in under 13 months.</P>

	<P>I want to clarify that on 10 March last the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination did not issue a judgment imposing an obligation on the Irish State to promote the establishment of multi-denominational schools. Rather the committee encouraged Ireland to promote the establishment of non-denominational or multidenominational schools.</P>
        <P>The committee recommended that this matter be addressed along with all other observations made when Ireland submits its third and fourth periodic reports by January 2008. My Department will furnish its response on this specific observation as part of that wider reporting by Ireland requested by the committee.</P>
        <P>As regards the establishment of new multi-denominational schools in recent years, it should be noted that of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage. Of the other 12 schools granted provisional recognition, six are Gaelscoileanna, five are under Catholic patronage and one is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland. The procedures for establishing new schools are extremely fair and transparent. All potential sponsors of schools, whether the patron is one of Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jewish faith or one such as Educate Together or part of the Gaelscoileanna movement, are treated on an equal basis.</P>
        <P>The criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools were revised in 2002, based on the recommendations of a report of the Commission on School Accommodation, on which the education partners were represented. Applications for the recognition of new schools are assessed by an independent advisory board &mdash; the new schools advisory committee &mdash; on the basis of the facts provided by the patron body in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places. Schools are granted provisional recognition and permanent recognition follows when long term viability has been established on actual enrolments over a period.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Perry</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the measures she has in place to address safety on school transport to ensure that no further fatal accident occurs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[21879/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding the dreadful accident in Meath last month, it should be remembered that the safety record of the school bus service is very good, bearing in mind that more or less 138,000 children, are transported each day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. Comparisons of Irish data on road accidents indicate that the risks of travelling on a bus are far lower than for other forms of road transport.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, safety on school buses is constantly under review, and only last January, the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for school transport, Deputy S&iacute;le de Valera, initiated a warning flashing light pilot scheme on school buses. These lights reduce the risk of accidents in the vicinity of the school bus as pupils descend and where safety research has shown the majority of accidents occur. It is planned to roll out the scheme on a phased basis to other parts of the country following a successful evaluation of the pilot project.</P>
        <P>The question of introducing legislation to require motorists to stop on approaching a school bus showing flashing lights is being actively examined. All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department&rsquo;s annual roadworthiness test. No bus which is unsafe or dangerous is allowed on to the road to carry chil<Col N="924"/>dren. Measures are also in place to control speed. Single deck buses with more than eight seats are subject to a speed limit of 80 km/h and double deck vehicles are subject to a speed limit of 65 km/h.</P>
        <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor, and may be subject to ongoing medical review. All such drivers must hold a current driving licence, appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. The company also provides training to bring drivers up to the requisite standard, if necessary. In addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus drivers must pass a driving assessment conducted by specially trained and qualified inspectors. Vehicle familiarisation with different types of school buses is carried out on an ongoing basis. Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus drivers have also attended a disability awareness training course, especially designed to take account of the requirements of children with special needs who travel under the school transport scheme. This course is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Contractors&rsquo; school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor, and may be subject to ongoing medical review by the chief medical officer of CIE. It is a condition of the contract agreement that no person shall be allowed to drive a school bus if having been requested, they refuse to submit themselves for medical examination, or if they are certified unfit. All contractors must hold a current driving licence, appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. Bus &Eacute;ireann maintain a record of driving licences on file for all nominated contractors. Bus &Eacute;ireann has facilitated contractors and their school bus drivers who drive services under the school transport scheme for children with special needs to attend the ongoing disability awareness training course organised for the company&rsquo;s personnel. Contractors, as independent private bus operators, may at their own discretion, provide additional training for their employees. Since 1999, Bus &Eacute;ireann has purchased a large number of vehicles as part of an ongoing school bus fleet replacement programme, to continually improve the age profile and condition of their school bus fleet. In addition, the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet currently has some 400 large capacity buses that were transferred from the general service fleet into the dedicated school transport bus fleet. More than 250 of these buses were transferred in the period 1999-2003, and they represent another valuable source of replacement buses over this period. This investment has produced an improvement in the condition of the fleet generally and this fleet replacement programme, aimed at replacing older buses with more modern vehicles, is continuing.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that arrangements are being made by my Department to phase out the three for two seating arrangement on school <Col N="925"/>buses within the next three years, starting next September.</P>
        <P>As regards the provision of seatbelts on school buses, the Department is working closely with the Department of Transport on this issue and these deliberations will be guided by expert advice. The safety of our school buses is of course an issue of paramount importance and I would like to assure the Deputy of my commitment, and that of my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for school transport, towards ensuring that our school bus system is as safe as possible.</P>

	<P>In October 2000, my Department introduced a physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, the Department provided in excess of &euro;5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools to enable schools provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase associated resource materials.</P>
        <P>Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for subsequent years. The question of restoring the grant will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process in the coming years.</P>
        <P>I would, however, point out that schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula including physical education. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from &euro;57.14 <Col N="927"/>per pupil to &euro;133.58 in the current year, an increase of almost 134% in the period.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should also be aware that of the 151 additional projects announced last week for funding under the summer works 2005, 34 projects were for the provision or upgrade of play areas and PE halls.</P>

	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available at present.</P>
        <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000, and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. The board currently has an authorised staffing complement of 94. The priority I attach to supporting the NEWB is evident from the fact that the budget which it has been allocated for 2005 is up by 20% on the 2004 allocation, to nearly &euro;8 million. The board issued an information leaflet to 330,000 families and 4,000 schools in March, 2004. The leaflet targeted parents and guardians of children aged between six and 16 years of age and young people aged 16 and 17 who have left school early to start work. It outlined the role parents and guardians play in ensuring that their children do not miss out on education and training and also gave information about the National Educational Welfare Board. In addition, the board launched a new lo-call telephone number to inform parents and guardians about their legal role and responsibilities under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</P><Col N="928"/>
        <P>My Department also operates a number of programmes at both primary and post-primary level to tackle the problem of early school leaving. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
        <P>A key role in this regard is also played by the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme which helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also addresses issues in the community impinging on learning and educational participation. The school completion programme is aimed directly at those in danger of dropping out of the education system by targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P>
        <P>Both the HSCL scheme and all 82 school completion programme projects operate transfer programmes which are very important in assisting pupils in making the transition from primary to post-primary level.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality Of Opportunity In Schools, which I launched recently, focuses on addressing the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The action plan will be introduced on a phased basis &mdash; starting in the next school year &mdash; and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40m on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system. A continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of effective transfer programmes by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the school completion programme in this area.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 648 to 653, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Proficiency in literacy and numeracy tests is usually expressed in terms of a standard score. This standard score, which can be any number, but is usually 100 or a multiple of 100, is derived from the number of test items answered correctly by all of the pupils tested. The average score for all pupils is, therefore, an arbitrary artefact of the test design and is only meaningful when compared with something else, for example, the results of an assessment conducted previously or with the results obtained for a similar population elsewhere. In the case of national assessments, average scores can be compared over time using baseline data or, in the case of international assessments, the average score for Irish children can be compared with children of a similar age in other countries.</P>
        <P>National assessments of literacy standards at primary school level are conducted by means of a national reading survey of pupils in fifth class every five years. There are no national assessment data available for either third or sixth class but Ireland participated in the IEA international survey of reading literacy in 1991 which mainly involved nine year old children who were mainly in third class. The overall average score for Irish children was 509 which was above the international mean of 500. Ireland was ranked in 12th place of the 27 participating countries. Trends in literacy achievement measured by national assessments since, in 1993 and 1998, suggest that overall standards have changed only slightly since 1991.</P>
        <P>Ireland also participates in the OECD programme for international student assessment, PISA, of 15 year olds, 64% of whom were at junior certificate level when the most recent PISA survey was conducted in 2003. Ireland achieved a mean score of 515 on the reading literacy scale, considerably higher than the OECD average. Ireland&rsquo;s ranking in reading literacy was seventh out of 40 countries. Just three countries, Finland, Korea and Canada, had mean scores significantly higher than Ireland&rsquo;s.</P>
        <P>At primary level, surveys of achievement in mathematics at fourth class have been conducted on behalf of the Department of Education and Science by the Educational Research Centre, but <Col N="931"/>not at either third or sixth class level. The 1999 survey of mathematics found that pupils performed best on items dealing with data and chance, number and algebra and were weakest on items dealing with measures and shape and space. Performance on mathematical processes was strongest on understanding and recalling terminology, facts and definitions and implementing mathematical procedures. Pupils were less successful when dealing with mathematical reasoning, analysing and problem solving, evaluating solutions and understanding and making connections between mathematical processes and concepts. The overall achievement of boys and girls was not statistically significantly different, although more boys than girls were at the highest levels of achievement, at or above the 90th percentile, and also at lowest levels of achievement, at or below the tenth percentile.</P>
        <P>At second level, in the 2003 PISA where mathematics was the major domain, Ireland ranked 17th of 29 OECD countries on mathematics. The Irish mean score was not significantly different from the OECD mean, indicating average levels of performance in mathematics overall. However, the closer analysis that is afforded by the subscales shows that students in Ireland achieved scores that were significantly higher than the corresponding OECD mean score in two mathematics sub-domains, uncertainty and change and relationships, at the OECD average in one, quantity, and below the OECD average in one, space and shape.</P>
        <P>These results give a fuller picture of our students&rsquo; performance and point to strengths that are not obvious from the data on overall scores alone. A noteworthy aspect of Ireland&rsquo;s performance when compared with OECD countries is that fewer students performed at the lowest proficiency levels, level one or below. The figure here was 16.8% as against the OECD mean of 21.4%. This provides evidence of comparatively good standards among low achievers. Promotion of the achievement of highest education standards in literacy and numeracy among all learners will continue to be a priority for my Department.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each <Col N="932"/>child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Under the rules for national schools, the compulsory school-going age for children is six years of age and the National Educational Welfare Board has specific responsibility for the education and welfare of children who are aged between six and 16 years of age. A person under the age of six is not a child for the purposes of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and a parent is not under a legal obligation to ensure their attendance at school.</P>
        <P>One of the functions of the board, as outlined in the Act, is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. The board has a programme of research in progress and has commissioned a firm of consultants to research the reasons for non-attendance by all primary and post-primary pupils, including those under six years of age. The board has indicated to my Department that the research will be completed and published in the autumn of this year. Pending receipt of the report from the board in due course, my Department has no plans to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</P>

	<P>The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to the number of exemptions granted from the study of Irish are not readily available for the years requested. However, the following is the available information: the total number of exemptions granted in the period October 1998 to date was 9,098; in the period from January 2004 to December 2004 the number of exemptions granted was 1,608; and in the period January 2005 to date the number granted was 1,359.</P>
        <P>As part of the primary school curriculum Irish is a compulsory subject. Exemption from the study of Irish may, however, be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances outlined in Department circular 12/96. Under the terms of the circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, has been vested in the individual school authority. The scheme is under review by my Department and any new arrangements arising therefrom will be notified to schools by way of circular letter.</P>

        <P>My Department has issued guidelines on the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish to primary and post-primary schools. My Department&rsquo;s guidelines on an exemption from Irish at post-primary level are outlined at rule 46 of the Rules and Programmes for Secondary Schools and circular letter M10/94. Under the terms of this circular, my Department has delegated authority to the principals of second level schools to grant the exemptions provided that the pupil meets the criteria as set down. Exemptions may be granted by school authorities for pupils whose primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland, pupils who were previously enrolled as recognised pupils in a primary school or second level school who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the pupil is at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment and certain categories of pupils with special educational needs, as set out in circular M10/94 or pupils from abroad who have no understanding of English when enrolled.</P>

	<P>The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. This staffing schedule is outlined in primary circular 15/05 which issued to all primary schools recently. This is in line with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>In the current school year the staffing of the school comprises of principal and 14 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 386 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has a learning support post and resource post. The mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will remain at <Col N="936"/>a principal and 14 mainstream class teaching posts. This is based on an enrolment of 384 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that all primary schools will operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. School authorities should ensure there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02, which is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The appeals board met on 14 June and will meet again in July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year. The closing dates for appeals for the forthcoming July and October meetings are 24 June and 7 October 2005, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The application form is available from the primary payments section or on my Department&rsquo;s website. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</P>

	<P>The number of NEPS psychologists has increased almost threefold from 43 psychologists on establishment to 127 psychologists at present, including three NDA psychologists serving with NEPS and one psychologist currently serving with another section of the Department. This number does not include two psychologists who are on career break.</P>
        <P>All schools which do not have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, whereby they can commission assessments from a member of a panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>NEPS also provides assistance for all schools which suffer from critical incidents, regardless of <Col N="937"/>whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service is conducting a new recruitment competition for NEPS. Regional panels, rather than one national panel, will be established on the results of this new competition. This will allow my Department to give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. Any increase in the overall numbers of psychologists in NEPS must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>I wish to clarify that on 10 March last the United Nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination did not issue a judgment imposing an obligation on the State to promote the establishment of multidenominational schools. Rather, the committee encouraged Ireland to promote the establishment of non-denominational or multidenominational schools. The committee recommended that this matter be addressed with all other observations made when Ireland submits its third and fourth periodic reports by January 2008. My Department will furnish its response on this specific observation as part of that wider reporting by Ireland requested by the committee.</P>
        <P>In relation to the establishment of new multidenominational schools in recent years, it should be noted that of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of which are under Educate Together patronage. Of the other 12 schools granted provisional recognition, six are Gaelscoileanna, five are under Catholic patronage and one is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The procedures for establishing new schools are extremely fair and transparent. All potential sponsors of schools, whether the patron is one of Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jewish faith or one such as Educate Together or the Gaelscoileanna movement, are treated on an equal basis. The criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools were revised in 2002 based on the recommendations of a report of the Commission on School Accommodation, on which the education partners were represented.</P>
        <P>Applications for the recognition of new schools are assessed by an independent advisory board, the new schools advisory committee, on the basis <Col N="938"/>of the facts provided by the patron body in support of the case for the new school and the likely demand for places. Schools are granted provisional recognition and permanent recognition follows when long-term viability has been established on actual enrolments over a period.</P>

	<P>The central vetting unit is run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is, therefore, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has primary responsibility in this area. The vetting unit is responsible for vetting requests regarding prospective employees of designated agencies who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The designated agencies comprise more than 900 organisations. In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of requests for clearance from my Department in relation to bus escorts and special needs assistants provided for children with special educational needs and staff working in children detention schools.</P>
        <P>A cross-governmental working group, established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit, recommended in March 2004 the expansion of its services to include all people working with children and vulnerable adults. To this end, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided for the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with chil<Col N="939"/>dren and vulnerable adults.

	<P>My Department is planning the development of a new post-primary school in Dublin 15 to serve the growing population of that area. The acquisition process for this site is at an advanced stage. However, due to the commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, the information requested by the Deputy relating to site cost is not available for release.

My Department is pursuing the acquisition of a site to provide permanent accommodation for the school. However, in common with the Phibblestown site I am unable to provide specifics on the site acquisition process due to commercial sensitivities.</P>
        <P>In both instances the amount of land to be acquired will allow for the development of school facilities to meet the needs of the area with shared community facilities which will be developed in conjunction with Fingal County Council. This co-operation ensures that the delivery of school and community facilities maximises the use of available land and avoids the duplication of facilities such as sports halls and playing pitches.</P>

	<P>A new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The local special educational needs organiser has determined that the special educational needs of the pupil in question fall within the high incidence disability categories and his needs, therefore, continue to be catered for from within the school&rsquo;s general allocation.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is ten part-time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met.</P>
        <P>Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the chil<Col N="943"/>dren then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</P>

        <P>It is proposed that a double autism unit will be established at the school in question. In this regard, appropriate classroom accommodation has been provided in the school for this purpose.</P>
        <P>My officials have been liaising with the school authorities for some time on the resources to be made available to facilitate the operation of the classes. My Department has confirmed that the classes will be capable of catering for up to 12 pupils with autism at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1. In addition, two full-time special needs assistants will be allocated to each class. Additional SNAs for the classes may be considered on the basis of <Col N="944"/>the individual assessed needs of the pupils enrolled.</P>
        <P>The school authorities submitted a request for resources over and above those which are generally provided for schools when establishing such classes to my Department. A number of meetings have taken place between the school and officials from my Department with a view to resolving the issues that have been raised by the school. The latest of these meetings took place on 2 June when three officials from my Department met the school&rsquo;s board of management. At that meeting it was agreed that the board would consider the issues that had been discussed and send its views in writing on those issues to the Department. My Department is awaiting that submission and on receipt of it will give this matter urgent consideration.</P>
        <P>The Department is extremely anxious that this purpose-built facility for children with autism would become operational as soon as possible and it is hoped that the issues that have been raised by the school can be resolved in the near future.</P>

	<P>Special needs assistants are assigned to schools to meet the care needs of individual children who have been assessed by a psychologist as needing this type of support. Applications for SNA support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education which processes all applications for support from schools and communicates the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for SNAs that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</P>
        <P>The pupil in question is in receipt of full-time SNA support and I understand that another pupil with special care needs will be enrolling in the same class next September. The existing SNA support in the class will be shared between both pupils. This arrangement will be kept under review by the local special educational needs organiser.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from under 300 to 6,300 nationally. In addition, more effective systems such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 678 to 680, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The current level of funding that my Department provides for Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Scoileanna L&aacute;n-Ghaeilge, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. Nonetheless, my Department is engaged in discussions with Educate Together on its funding needs. The provision of some additional funding in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to Educate Together is under discussion with its longer term needs.</P>
        <P>The issue of additional funding for Educate Together from other State sources is essentially a matter for the patron body to pursue with the relevant interests outside of my Department.</P>
        <P>On support for the establishment of new multi-denominational schools, it should be noted that my Department has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage.</P>
        <P>My Department has made a number of changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes which was strongly welcomed by Educate Together was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings which had cost up to &euro;63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a school (details supplied) in Dublin 24 is losing one and a half teachers under the general allocation system; her views on whether this is a serious and unacceptable decrease in resources for a school designated as disadvantaged; the steps she will take to have these positions restored; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the disadvantaged areas scheme, the Giving Children an Even Break programme and the support teacher scheme.</P>
        <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme, the school benefits from the allocation of one concessionary teaching post, additional capitation grants of &euro;38.09 <i>per capita</i>, a refund of the television licence fee and eligibility for 95% building grants for building projects. Designated disadvantaged schools are included in the home-school community liaison scheme and this school has the service of a shared home-school community liaison co-ordinator.</P>
        <P>Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department&rsquo;s approach is now refined to ensure that individual at-risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, under this scheme my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school-leaving.</P>
        <P>The school referred to by the Deputy is included in the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break. The school is benefiting from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school is not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the level of concentration of at-risk pupils within the school.</P>
        <P>The support teacher project supports 47 designated schools with 41 teachers. It aims to co-ordinate a whole school approach to designing and implementing good practice and strategies. These strategies will help to prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom. The school to which the Deputy refers has one full support teacher project post.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; which I launched recently provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan will be introduced on a <Col N="947"/>phased basis starting in the next school year and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process which is being conducted on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre is under way. Questionnaires issued to all mainstream primary schools and were due to be returned to the ERC by 31 May 2005. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representation from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network.</P>
        <P>Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural and 150 post-primary schools, will be included in the school support programme. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is one full-time permanent teaching post. In addition, the school may be entitled to retain part-time hours under transitional arrangements to cater for the needs of individual pupils with high incidence special needs until such time as these pupils leave the school. The school in question has made an application to retain part-time hours under transitional arrangements. My officials are examining this proposal and the school authorities will be notified of the outcome in due course.</P>
        <P>I can also confirm that the school&rsquo;s resource teaching allocation under the new scheme is based on its status as a boys&rsquo; school: the first post is allocated at 135:1. Schools whose allocations are based on 80:1 are those disadvantaged schools that are specifically eligible for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme. As the school is not eligible for such additional staffing, it does not qualify for the special 80:1 ratio for resource teacher allocation.</P>

	<P>The Giving Children an Even Break programme was launched in 2001 and subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage and my Department&rsquo;s approach is now refined to ensure that individual at-risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, under this scheme my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school-leaving. Some 242 primary schools are considered for staffing under this scheme with 309 teaching posts allocated for the 2005-06 school year.</P>

Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>
        <P>A new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with <Col N="949"/>high incidence special needs and learning support needs was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year in order that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangement disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources, as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. Of these, 340 are permanent posts and 320 are temporary posts being provided to ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow the school to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</P>
        <P>The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under these new arrangements. In fact, the reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme. I am grateful to the Minister for Finance for providing me with the resources to ensure that the new system could be put in place. As of next September there will be over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Government and I, as Minister for Education and Science, are deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 685 and 720 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, my Department has issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their teaching allocation under the new general allocation model for the 2005-06 school year. The letter also includes details of any clustering arrangements that may apply.</P><Col N="951"/>
        <P>The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>One of the objectives of the general allocation model is to maximise the extent of full-time permanent posts available to support the needs of pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, SEN, and learning support teacher requirements. Clustering facilitates the assignment of experienced teachers as well as allowing for better training of resource teachers on the basis that permanent posts will retain teachers for longer periods. This ultimately benefits the pupils. To this end, schools, particularly those with small enrolments, have been grouped in clusters where possible.</P>
        <P>My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the commencement of the next school year. It is also intended that this circular will address issues that have been raised by schools with my Department since the system was notified to schools in mid-May.</P>
        <P>The staffing of the school in question is one principal and one mainstream class teacher. The school&rsquo;s entitlement under the general allocation system, based on an enrolment of 15, is 2.5 hours. The school is in a cluster arrangement with three other local schools creating two full-time permanent posts and ten part-time hours. A proposal has been received from the schools concerned to alter the clustering arrangements proposed. This proposal will be examined shortly and the school authorities will be notified accordingly.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met.</P>
        <P>Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child.</P>

	<P>The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the rural dimension of my Department&rsquo;s Giving Children an Even Break programme aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; which I launched recently provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting in the next school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process which is being conducted on behalf of my Department by the Educational Research Centre is under way. Questionnaires issued to all mainstream primary schools, including the school to which the Deputy refers and were due to be returned to the ERC by 31 May 2005. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representation from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals&rsquo; Network.</P>
        <P>Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural and 150 post-primary schools, will be included in the school support programme. Existing schemes and programmes will be integrated into the school support programme on a phased basis over the implementation period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. Current provision for pupils with autism includes 146 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools; 14 pre-school classes for children <Col N="954"/>with autism; ten autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism and five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome have been created. All such classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 with the support of a minimum of two special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>The level of resource teaching support provided for pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. In general, such pupils would be eligible for five hours resource teaching support. In addition, my Department sanctions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home-based applied behavioural analysis programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005 the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and, in particular, it is responsible for deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. In the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>The advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in the area referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require, when and where they require it. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs, including those with autism, and the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

Cabas Cork has recently been sanctioned additional funding to provide for an increased enrolment from 30 children to 32 and funding has been allocated to provide for the additional staffing required. Cabas Kilbarrack has been sanctioned to expand from 24 children to 30. The funding allocation for the 2005-06 school year for Cork and Dublin will represent an increase on the 2004-05 allocation to take into account the additional resources required to fund the expansion of these facilities. My Department has given approval for a Cabas facility for south Dublin. This additional provision for children on the autistic spectrum is due to open in the 2005-06 school year.</P>

	<P>My Department monitors the cost limits for all school building projects on an ongoing basis, taking into account factors such as current conditions in the construction industry, published cost indices for labour and materials and movements in tender levels. Account is also taken of historical data on tender prices and changes arising from adjustments to school planning guidelines. In addition, the standard guidelines relating to public procurement are followed and the competitive element involved in the tendering process also ensures value for money.</P>
        <P>The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, in a permanent manner rather than relying on temporary accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. Its purpose is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in this pilot of the initiative was positive and the initiative was expanded to include 44 additional primary schools in 2004. Over 70 schools have been invited to participate in this initiative in 2005.</P>

	<P>The assumption has not been made by my Department that a new primary school will be required for every 500 new homes built. The profile of new homes, the rate and pace of their delivery, the projected occupancy rate which varies from area to area, the likely pupil output, together with the availability of existing accommodation are all factors which must be taken into consideration before it can be decided if a new school is necessary.</P>
        <P>My Department will at all times seek to maximise existing accommodation which means that any extra accommodation needed may be met by way of extensions or the rationalisation of existing provision to free up buildings, rather than by the provision of a new school. With regard to individual new schools, the cost is dependent on site costs which vary, the ultimate level of land take and the size of a school itself.</P>
        <P>The school planning section of my Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising my Department&rsquo;s land requirements, thereby reducing site costs while at the same time avoiding the duplication of facilities such as sports halls and playing pitches. Given the variables involved and the unique situation which might pertain to any given area, a cost exercise along the lines set out by the Deputy has not been carried out.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the use of schools <Col N="958"/>after-hours as child care facilities and on whether this is a feasible use for educational facilities; the likely cost to the Exchequer of such a move; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>School facilities should be available to the community outside of school hours, whether for child care, for adult education courses or as somewhere for local community groups to meet, provided it is feasible.</P>
        <P>My Department issued a circular to the trustees, boards of management and principals of primary and voluntary secondary schools in March encouraging them to make their facilities available to local community groups outside of school hours. Many schools have an excellent record of doing so and have become a hive of local activity. However, the State does not, in fact, own the majority, more than 95%, of our schools, as most are owned by the religious. They are owned by their trustees and managed by their boards of management, whose right it is to decide on the use of school facilities outside of school time, subject to the terms of any existing lease on the property.</P>
        <P>Before permitting after-hours use, school authorities must be satisfied adequate insurance is in place to cover the activities in question and the proposed use does not interfere in any way with the delivery of education in the school. Provided agreement can be reached with the board of management of a school on issues such as insurance, it is possible to provide pre-school and after-school child care in schools.</P>
        <P>I welcome the funding announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, last week for child care provision in school facilities and hope that the trustees and boards of management of many schools will make the necessary local arrangements to avail of this initiative.</P>

	<P>A new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system.</P>
        <P>The general allocation for the school in question is 20 part-time hours. My Department has received a proposal from the school in question regarding the deployment of this allocation. An official in my Department was recently in contact with the school authorities to discuss the options available to the school. The matter is still under consideration and a letter confirming the final position will issue to the school in the coming days once a decision has been reached.</P>

        <P>Grant assistance in respect of approved higher certificate and ordinary degree courses is awarded to eligible candidates under the terms and conditions prescribed in my Department&rsquo;s third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. Under the scheme&rsquo;s terms, candidates may in general only receive funding in respect of one approved third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees course. Notwithstanding this condition, the scheme does, however, provide for progression in specific circumstances where, for instance, a candidate who has completed a two-year higher certificate course progresses to the add-on year of a directly related ordinary degree. Another exception where grant assistance may be extended in respect of a subsequent third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees course would be where, following completion of a two-year higher certificate, a candidate gets an exemption into year two of a related ordinary degree course.</P>
        <P>The scheme does not provide grant assistance where, as in this case, a candidate has completed a two-year higher certificate and subsequently pursues a three-year ordinary degree course which is not directly related to his or her previous course.</P>

	<P>All applications submitted to my Department for major capital funding are assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation for large scale building projects. As part of this assessment, projects are identified as being suitable for delivery by a devolved route.</P>
        <P>In 2004 projects were considered under two separate devolved headings, the small schools initiative and the permanent initiative. Under these headings a total of 81 schools accepted the devolved system and 11 declined. In 2005 the headings for the devolved schemes included the small schools initiative, the permanent initiative and the relocation of prefabs. Under these headings 173 schools accepted the devolved system and 12 declined. The allocation for 2004 was &euro;20.7 million. The allocation for 2005 is in excess of &euro;44 million. Schools declining funding by way of the devolved initiatives follow the traditional delivery method. Progress on these projects is considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.</P>

	<P>Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early childhood education encompasses pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, for Traveller children and those with special needs.</P>
        <P>My Department funds 48 pre-school classes for traveller children. In the special needs sector, there are 14 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition, ten stand alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis model of <Col N="962"/>response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on pre-primary education in 2002 was as follows: special education provision, estimated, &euro;900,000*; centre for early childhood development and education, &euro;444,300; Early Start, estimated, &euro;4,000,000**; Rutland Street Project, estimated, &euro;580,000**; pre-schools for Travellers, estimated, &euro;1,250,000**.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 705 and 709 together.</P>
        <P>The national youth work development plan, published in August 2003, identifies four main goals and proposes some 50 action points to achieve these goals over a five-year period. Work has commenced on certain priority areas as follows. 2003 an amount of &euro;80,000 was allocated in 2003 to the implementation of the child protection training programme for the sector. In 2004 an amount of &euro;500,000 was made available in 2004 for the roll-out of the plan and was expended on further support for the child protection training programme for the youth sector; the development of projects funded under the special projects for youth scheme; the Increased support to youth information centres and the youth information support partnership.</P>
        <P>In 2005 an 18% increase in funding for the youth work sector has been provided for in the 2005 Estimates. This additional funding will cater for several developments under the national youth work development plan and the Youth Work Act 2001. The following measures, will be addressed as a result of this: additional funding; upgrading of some one worker special projects for youth; additional special projects for youth increase in local youth clubs grant scheme; development fund for youth organisations; funding review consultancy; youth information consultancy; special once-off funding for youth work organisations; continued funding for child protection training programme; North-South youth work training endorsement panel.</P>
        <P>Additionally, funding is available for to the appointment of an assessor of youth work. My Department is also working towards the provision of resources for VECs to enable them fulfil their responsibilities under the Youth Work Act 2001. A portion of the funding will be allocated towards both of these matters. With regard to the implementation of a child protection programme for the youth work sector, the National Youth Council of Ireland appointed a national co-ordinator for child protection in December 2004 to manage and oversee its implementation.</P>
        <P>The duties of the national co-ordinator include the development and implementation of a comprehensive awareness and training programme for the youth work sector based on the code of good practice, Child Protection for the Youth Work Sector, September 2002, as well as the assessment of the child protection training needs of the youth work sector. A preliminary needs analysis of youth organisations was carried out in January 2005 and this identified the priority need of training youth workers in a training of trainers programme. In April 2005, 19 youth workers commenced the keeping safe child protection <Col N="964"/>training programme, accredited by the Open College Network. The final moderation of this programme will be in September 2005, when these workers will be accredited child protection trainers of trainers.</P>
        <P>Work has also commenced on developing a national child protection basic awareness training programme. The keeping safe programme is also being modified and updated in order to seek national accreditation. An independent analysis of child protection needs will commence in September 2005 and a child protection workers&rsquo; forum will take place in October 2005.</P>

	<P>On 3 December 2004, Jarvis, the appointed preferred bidder for the Cork School of Music PPP project, announced that it had reached an agreement with Hochtief Developments (UK) Limited to purchase the PPP bidding arm of its business. Following the announcement, various issues surrounding the purchase were being completed and a revised proposal and documentation in connection with the project was received on 19 January 2005.</P>
        <P>As Hochtief had replaced Jarvis as the main member of the bidding consortium, it had to satisfy the Department that had it applied under the terms of the original PPP advertised in 2000. It would have been one of the consortia that pre-qualified for the project. In addition to satisfying the pre-qualification conditions and in advance of any formal contract negotiations, over recent months my Department&rsquo;s specialist advisers to the project also had to undertake a full financial and legal due diligence to ensure that the new proposal met all EU procurement guidelines. Part of the due diligence process included contact with the relevant section of the EU Commission for clarification and advice on the procurement issue surrounding the change to the bidding consortia.</P>

	<P>All schools in County Clare have access to psychological assessments, either directly through the national educational psychological service for those schools served by national educational psychological service, or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments for those that do not have national educational psychological service psychologists assigned to them.</P>
        <P>All schools that do not have national educational psychological service psychologists assigned to them may avail of this scheme, whereby they can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by national educational psychological service, and national educational psychological service will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The national educational psychological service also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a national educational psychological service psychologist assigned to them. The national educational psychological service processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations. All rural post-primary schools and 35 rural primary schools in County Clare have national educational psychological service psychologists assigned to them. The complement of psychologists in national educational psychological service has increased almost three-fold from 43 psychologists on establishment to 127 psychologists.</P>
        <P>On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service is running a new recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to the national educational psychological service and priority will be given to filling vacancies in the mid-western and north-western regions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for <Col N="967"/>service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms and the maintenance of a database of pupils with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, who are in receipt of special education services in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Since the task force reported, several initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for pupils with dyslexia; the development, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, of an information resource on dyslexia which is available in CD-ROM, DVD and video format.</P>
        <P>A key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures, which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government&rsquo;s decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The council which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs supports. The council has a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. The council has a local area presence through a network of 71 special educational needs organisers.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Oireachtas has approved the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. This act sets out the rights and entitlements of persons with special educational needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and provides the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser directly for this support.</P>
        <P>Training is available through the 21 teacher education centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assisting technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia. The provision of resources to <Col N="968"/>address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. Last month, I announced 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to cater for the needs of pupils with high incidence special needs, including pupils with dyslexia. Every primary school in the country will be allocated resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures to cater for this pupil cohort from September 2005.</P>
        <P>It is now the case that one in five of the teachers in primary schools is allocated for the support of children with special educational needs including with dyslexia. Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1.</P>
        <P>At second level, each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of less than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more, receive a full learning support post. The Department also allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special needs, including pupils with dyslexia.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 528 remedial/learning support teachers, 620 guidance posts and 1,388 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs. A further 100 posts will be allocated for guidance from the commencement of the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department established the special education support service to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The service, hosted in Laois Education Centre, provides a nationwide service to teachers and special needs assistants. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the service is developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas, autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the education centre network.</P><Col N="969"/>
        <P>My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. This represents significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to inform the Deputy as to how many special needs assistants in County Clare will have their contracts renewed for the new school year. The retention of special needs assistants by schools can vary from school to school depending on the needs of the individual children and whether or not the children are due to leave school at the end of this school year. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of special needs assistants rests with the relevant school authorities and it is a matter for the school authorities to inform special needs assistants employed by them of the situation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In order to assist schools in this regard, my Department has recently issued a letter to schools who have surplus special needs assistants staff which contained guidelines for schools in selecting staff that should be let go. The letter confirmed that the selection criteria for determining whose contract should be terminated will be on a last in, first out basis, subject to the contractual position pertaining in schools. This means that, unless the most junior special needs assistant in the school has a written child specific contract that entitles her/him to remain in the school, her/his contract should be terminated on the basis that she/he is the most junior special needs assistant in the school in terms of length of service.</P>
        <P>If however the school has operated on the basis of employing all special needs assistants on child specific contracts, and offered such contracts to the special needs assistants, it is the special needs assistant who is attached to the child who has been identified as no longer needing the services of an special needs assistant that should be released.</P>
        <P>Applications for special needs assistant support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education who process all applications for support from schools and communicate the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for special needs assistants that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</P>
        <P>The Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Indeed, since 1998, the number of special needs assistants has increased from under 300 to over 6,000 nationally. In addition to this, more <Col N="970"/>effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</P>

	<P>Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the board of management of each individual school. My Department has no role in respect of processing applications for enrolment by schools. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 <Col N="971"/>to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs supports and decides on the level of support appropriate to the school. A total of 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents. The SENOs are responsible for co-ordinating and facilitating delivery of educational services to children with disabilities at local level. Any parent who is experiencing difficulty in securing an appropriate placement for his or her child should make contact with their local SENO in the first instance. Contact details of the relevant SENO are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is a further statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.

	<P>Special needs assistants, SNAs, are assigned to schools to meet the care needs of individual children who have been assessed by a psychologist as needing this type of support. I can confirm that there has been no change to the criteria or guidelines for allocating SNA support to schools and I can further confirm that there are no plans to review the criteria or guidelines under which SNA support is allocated.</P>
        <P>Applications for SNA support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education who process all applications for support from schools and communicate the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for SNAs that will be required from the beginning of September 2005. However, in order to ensure that resources are used in the most effective manner, a review has been conducted in recent months to establish whether primary schools have the level of SNA support that they need for children in their care, whether they have resources <Col N="972"/>which they no longer need or whether they need extra resources.</P>
        <P>The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the SNA was originally sanctioned that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus SNA support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>My Department had been engaged in discussions with the trade union representing special needs assistants, SNAs, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on a number of issues relating to the employment of SNAs.

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high-incidence special needs and learning support needs, was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangement disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources, as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties.</P>
        <P>To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. A total of 340 of these are permanent posts and 320 are <Col N="974"/>temporary posts being provided to ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow the school to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</P>
        <P>The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under these new arrangements. In fact the reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Addressing the concerns of small and rural schools was, as the Deputy will be aware, the reason why I initiated a review of the original general allocation model which had been announced last year, to come into effect in the 2005 to 2006 school year. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure that they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</P>
        <P>As of next September there will be over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Government, and I as Minister for Education and Science, am deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. I believe that, in addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</P>

	<P>The Department&rsquo;s records are held on a calendar year basis and the information which I am providing reflects that position. In the last five years my Department has spent &euro;39.1million on the rental of temporary school premises. The breakdown of this expenditure by year is &euro;4,002,339 in 2000, &euro;6,039,060 in 2001, &euro;8,402,140 in 2002, &euro;9,329,997 in 2003 and &euro;11,306,660 in 2004. This expenditure is not categorised by accommodation type and I cannot therefore readily identify for the Deputy the portion of the expenditure that may relate to demountable temporary accommodation.</P>
        <P>In the last five years my Department has spent &euro;73.5 million on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in the primary and post-primary sectors. The breakdown of the expenditure by year is &euro;4,407,981 in 2000, &euro;9,108,090 in 2001, &euro;21,463,576 in 2002, &euro;25,838, 453 in 2003 and &euro;12,711,802 in 2004. This expenditure represents less than 5% of the total expenditure on school buildings between 2000 and 2004. The total spent between 2000 and 2004 on primary and post-primary school buildings including PPP projects at second level amounted to &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
        <P>This expenditure was for the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings including associated site works and other costs such as for compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, connections for water, electricity and sewage. The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded to include 44 additional primary schools in 2004. Over 70 schools have been invited to participate in this initiative in 2005.</P>
        <P>The Department of Finance is not directly involved in the procurement of temporary accommodation. My Department issues guidance to schools in respect of the tendering process which is in compliance with public procurement pro<Col N="976"/>cedures. Where school authorities are given approval to rent temporary accommodation on the basis of proven need the arrangement stays in place while that need exists or until such time as the need is met by a more permanent solution.</P>
        <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the number of individual units rented at each school is not readily available. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details in respect of any particular school my officials will provide the information required.</P>

	<P>Terms such as &ldquo;mild&rdquo;, &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; or &ldquo;severe&rdquo; reading difficulties are not defined in Irish research literature on reading attainment, in comparable international research literature or by my Department. In the absence of an operational definition of these terms, it is difficult to give a precise estimate of the number of pupils who might fall into these categories. It is crucial is that there is a system in place for identifying pupils who are experiencing reading difficulties relative to their peers and that supports can be allocated to them.</P>
        <P>The system used in primary schools for identifying pupils with literacy difficulties is to use a cut-off point of the tenth percentile on a standardised test in combination with teachers&rsquo; professional judgments and to allocate learning support to those pupils who function at or below that level. It is generally accepted that the tenth percentile would identify the pupils to whom the Deputy refers. At any given time there are 40,000 to 45,000 pupils in primary schools who perform at this level and their needs are catered for in the first instance by class teachers with assistance from learning support and resource teachers, as required. International comparisons of achievement are not available in relation to pupils at primary level. However, the results of the programme of international student assessment, PISA, provide detailed information on the standards of reading literacy among Irish five year olds. In the 2003 survey, Ireland ranked sixth in reading out of the 29 OECD countries. The percentage of Irish students whose performance in reading was at the lowest level of proficiency, below level 1, was 2.7%. The corresponding OECD average was 6.7%. This indicates that the proportion of students with serious reading difficulties in Ireland is less than half that of the OECD average. The results of the PISA survey conducted in 2000 provide similar evidence with regard to the prevalence of reading difficulties of this nature among Irish 15 year olds.</P>

        <P>At second level, the overall whole-time equivalent number of teaching staff for the 1998 to 1999 school year was 23,435. The breakdown between the sectors is as follows: secondary 13,223; vocational 6,602; community 3,026 and comprehensive, 584. In the 2004 to 2005 school year, the overall whole-time equivalent number of teaching staff is 24,962. The breakdown between the sectors is as follows: secondary, 13,269; vocational 7,634; community 3,434 and comprehensive, 625.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the number of students at post-primary level has decreased considerably during this time. In 1998 to 1999, there were 362,051 students at post-primary level. By 2003 to 2004 the numbers had decreased to 337,851.</P>
        <P>At third level, the total number of teaching staff in universities was as follows: on 31 December 1998 there were 2,872 and on 31 December 2004, there were 3,839.</P>
        <P>The number of teaching staff in institutes of technology was as follows: in the 1997 to 1998 academic year the whole-time equivalent academic staff was 3,581, technological sector, and 3,557, institutes of technology only, while in the 2003 to 2004 academic year, the whole-time equivalent academic staff was 4,544, technological sector, and 4,462, institutes of technology only. The figures for the 2004 to 2005 academic year are not yet available in respect of Institutes of Technology. The technological sector includes Tourism College, Killybegs, TCK and Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute, TRBDI.</P>

        <P>I too was shocked to hear of the fire on a school bus last week. I understand there were no students on the bus and the driver was not injured. The causes of the fire are unknown at this point but Bus &Eacute;ireann are examining the remains of the bus carefully to establish how the fire happened. We know that the bus was a 1993 registered bus, that it has a roadworthiness certificate from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and that it had just undergone a service by Bus &Eacute;ireann last week. We simply do not know why the fire happened yet and will not until Bus &Eacute;ireann has concluded its investigation into the incident.</P>
        <P>I understand that as a precaution, the remaining nine buses similar to the bus that caught fire were taken out of service for examination. These buses were located in Athlone, Cork and Dundalk. My Department has asked Bus &Eacute;ireann for information on the cause of the fire as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. In accordance with the staffing schedule which issued recently to boards of management, the mainstream staffing of the school for the 2005-06 school year will be a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 238 pupils at 30 September 2004.</P>
        <P>To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeals board is now in place. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s primary circular 19/02 which is also available on its website. The appeals board met on 14 June and will meet again in July and October to consider appeals on the mainstream teaching allocation to schools for the 2005-06 school year. The closing dates for appeals for the forthcoming July and October meetings are 24 June and 7 October 2005, respectively. Appeals must be submitted to the primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criteria under which they being made. The application form is available from the primary payments section or on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may also be aware, my Department has issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their teaching allocation under the new general allocation model for the 2005-06 school year. The letter also includes details of any clustering arrangements that may apply. I would like to advise the Deputy that the school has been allocated three resource teaching posts to cater for the needs of pupils with high and low incidence special needs and learning difficulties and special educational needs for the forthcoming school year. The levels are appropriate in the context of reducing enrolments and the current number of pupils with special educational needs requiring a service. My officials have been in contact with the school authorities regarding its general allocation.</P>
        <P>My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the commencement of the next school year. It is also intended that this circular will address issues that have been raised by schools with my Department since <Col N="985"/>the system was notified to schools in mid-May. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better then taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. I have asked my officials to contact the school to discuss its concerns.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that my officials have worked closely with the Health Service Executive, northern area to develop an appropriate placement for the person in question. This placement at the Woodlawns centre in north Dublin has met with the approval of the High Court and remains available to the person should his parents be willing to consider sending him there.

        <P>The Woodlawns centre provides assessment, care, rehabilitation and education for individuals who have both a learning disability and other difficulties such as behavioural problems. An individual education plan will be drawn up to meet the young man&rsquo;s needs and will be delivered by a specialist teacher with the support of the special needs assistant. I understand from the HSE that a person centred plan to provide for his care needs will also be drawn up and will be delivered by the appropriate support staff in Woodlawns. He will also have access to occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</P>
        <P>This is a major improvement on the previous system under which children with high incidence special educational needs required a psychological assessment for every child before they were give resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangement disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. Some 340 of these are permanent posts and 320 are temporary posts being provided to ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow it to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</P>
        <P>The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under these new arrangements. In fact, the reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme.</P>
        <P>Addressing the concerns of small and rural schools was, as the Deputy will be aware, the reason I initiated a review of the original general allocation model which had been announced last year to come into effect in the 2005-06 school year. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure that they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</P>
        <P>If the Deputy wishes to provide information on the specific schools referred to in her question, I <Col N="987"/>would be happy to supply details in respect of their staffing allocations under the new scheme. Officials in my Department are willing to discuss the new arrangements with any school and a contact name and phone number for the relevant official was provided to all schools with the letter outlining its allocation.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the indemnity agreement concluded between the State and religious congregations on 5 June 2002, provision was made for a fund of &euro;12.7 million to be used to assist former residents of institutions and their families in pursuing educational programmes. Pending the establishment of this fund on a statutory basis, my Department introduced an administrative grants scheme for former residents and their families, which is being administered by the national office for victims of abuse, NOVA. To date approximately &euro;1.7 million has been expended under this scheme.</P>
        <P>The criteria and applications process for this scheme were developed and published by an <i>ad hoc </i>education committee which was established <Col N="989"/>by my Department in early 2003. In the event that an applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of an application to NOVA, the person can request that the matter be referred to a meeting of the <i>ad hoc </i>committee. A decision of the <i>ad hoc </i>committee may be referred to the Office of the Ombudsman for investigation. I have arranged for a copy of the grant criteria document to be forwarded to the Deputy for her information.</P>

	<P>Since the launch of the Giving Children an Even Break programme in 2001, my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. The levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the educational research centre in 2000 at the request of my Department. There are 58 schools in County Roscommon included in the rural dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, 19 of which has the services of a rural co-ordinator.</P>
        <P>Section 32(9) of the Education Act 1998 defines educational disadvantage as &ldquo;impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools&rdquo;. A village or rural community with a population of less than 1,500 is defined as rural for the purposes of Giving Children an Even Break. The information on current and expected special education teacher allocations for these schools will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest>the number of mixed primary schools in County Roscommon with an enrolment of less that 105.</Quest>
        <QRef>[22766/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the 2004-05 school year, there are 82 mixed primary schools in County Roscommon with an enrolment of less than 105 pupils. Each of these schools has benefited from the special favourable ratio for small mixed schools introduced recently under the general allocation scheme for providing resource teachers to schools to meet the needs of pupils with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia, and learning support needs.</P>
        <P>The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every <Col N="991"/>school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school. This is a major improvement on the previous system under which children with high incidence special educational needs required a psychological assessment for every child before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</P>
        <P>The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</P>
        <P>While the new scheme will not prevent schools from giving one-to-one time with the resource teacher to children that need it, it is important to note that one-to-one teaching is not the best option for every child.</P>
        <P>The extra resources being provided to support the introduction of this new scheme are a further demonstration of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>As of next September, there will be more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>

	<P>A major focus for my Department at present is the roll-out of broadband internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year &euro;18 million joint Government and IBEC &mdash; TIF fund. In this context, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, conducted a public procurement process designed to achieve the optimal solution for each school having regard to the broadband delivery technology options available.</P>
        <P>Following the outcome of the procurement process, a mix of broadband technologies will be utilised in schools, including wireless, fixed line, or DSL, and satellite technologies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 762 and 763 together.</P>
        <P>My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The HEG scheme is administered by the local authorities under the aegis of my Department, the other three maintenance grant schemes are administered on a similar basis by the VECs.</P>
        <P>The PLC scheme prescribes the terms and conditions of funding in respect of students attending courses in approved PLC centres. The other three schemes govern the award of grants to students attending approved courses in approved third level institutions. Grant applicants must be assessed by the awarding bodies with reference to the terms and conditions prescribed in the scheme relevant to the course being pursued and the college being attended.</P>
        <P>On the basis of the information submitted, my previous parliamentary response of 22 June to the Deputy outlined the position prescribed under the terms of the PLC scheme for students who already hold a third level qualification. If it is the case that the student concerned will be commencing an approved course in an approved third level institution in the 2005-06 academic year then her eligibility for grant assistance must assessed with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant third level scheme. In this event she should contact the relevant awarding body concerned with a view to submitting a grant application and establishing her eligibility to grant assistance as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>My Department has no plans to alter the terms of the PLC scheme to allow students who already hold a third level qualification to continue to receive PLC grant assistance.</P>

	<P>In the absence of more specific particulars, it is not possible for the military authorities to research their personnel records so as to positively identify the particular person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. However, in the light of the extreme gravity of the subject matter of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I will have the matter examined as a matter of urgency on receipt of specific particulars. I will then communicate further with the Deputy in writing.</P>
        <P>An enlisted individual may be discharged, under the terms of Defence Force Regulation A10 Part III paragraph 58 (m), as a result of conviction by the civil power. The discharge would take place only after conviction. It would be possible for an individual to apply for his own dis<Col N="1001"/>charge from the Permanent Defence Force under normal administrative procedures prior to the actual occasion of any such conviction. In such circumstances, the application for discharge would be dealt with and processed in the normal way.</P>
        <P>A conduct rating under Defence Force regulations would take account of an individual&rsquo;s record in the Defence Forces up to the date of discharge. However, it is important to note that even if the military authorities are aware of an outstanding civil criminal charge at the time of discharge, such pending civil proceedings could have no effect on the individual&rsquo;s military conduct rating, bearing in mind the fundamental legal principle of the presumption of innocence.</P>

	<P>Killarney House was transferred to the State by its previous owners in 1998 and, as part of Killarney National Park, is under the responsibility of the national parks and wildlife service of my Department. The future of Killarney House is being considered within the context of the management plan for Killarney National Park, which is currently being finalised following a period of public consultation. Under that plan, it is intended to retain <Col N="1002"/>and preserve the integrity and character of the house both internally and externally.</P>
        <P>Following the completion of detailed specialist surveys commissioned by the Office of Public Works, it is clear that major infrastructural works would be required to secure the fabric of Killarney House and to install adequate plumbing, heating and electrical systems if the House was to open to the public. The total cost of these works is estimated at &euro;5 million, which is well in excess of the original estimates for the work. Planning permission for a change of use would also be necessary before the house could be opened to the public. A decision on the nature and extent of works to Killarney House will depend on the future availability of capital funding, having regard to other demands on my Department&rsquo;s capital budget for further works.</P>

        <Quest>the recommendations contained in the NESC report, Housing in Ireland, which he will be implementing in the next 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The NESC housing report endorses the Government&rsquo;s general approach to housing policy while highlighting important policy challenges ahead. These include ensuring a high quality sustainable development in both urban and rural areas, assisting the market to maintain a high level of supply and providing an effective range of supports to those households who fall below the affordability threshold.</P>
        <P>We have being making substantial progress in addressing these concerns, with record overall housing output and increased investment in social and affordable housing. The new affordable homes partnership announced last week provides new impetus and additionally to the existing measures. The partnership will drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area. It is also intended that the partnership take responsibility, as far as practicable, for affordable housing initiative projects on State lands in the GDA. This will include the use of the land swap option, similar to that piloted on the Harcourt Terrace Lane site. That swap of the site of 0.4 of an acre will result in the delivery of 193 affordable houses in private housing estates, 140 of which will be available in 2005 and the balance by 2006. Consequently, substantially more households will benefit in a quicker timeframe than building on the Harcourt Terrace <Col N="1003"/>Lane site, which could only have accommodated some 30 apartments.</P>
        <P>Initially, the partnership will work via the existing planning and development framework but additional legislative powers will be made available should they prove necessary. In addition, consideration is to be given to approaches dealing with land options and a &ldquo;use it or lose it&rdquo; scheme. As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites.</P>
        <P>These measures are designed to provide a practical response, focused on delivery to the policy challenges identified by NESC. NESC also highlighted a number of issues, particular in the social housing area, for further consideration. The Government intends to address these more medium term issues for the provision of social and affordable housing in the early autumn. This process will be informed by the outcome of the statutory housing needs assessment under way and the work under way by the housing forum in reviewing the effectiveness of the existing social and affordable housing schemes in the context of the Sustaining Progress agreement.</P>

	<P>The EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, presents a challenge to all relevant stakeholder groups and its effective implementation will require a focused, committed approach from all concerned. In April 2005, I published draft regulations for the implementation of the directive and a consultation process with stakeholders, including representative groups from the retail sector, is taking place. The draft regulations do not go beyond the scope of the directive which provides for the taking back on a one-for-one basis of WEEE of a similar type or fulfilling the same function as a new item being purchased. Retailers will also be able to transfer, free of charge, collected WEEE to civic amenity sites. They may also, subject to the agreement of the appropriate local authorities, make alternative arrangements to in-store take-back, provided such arrangements are not more inconvenient for the purchaser and remain free of charge.</P>
        <P>A retailer will not be required to take back contaminated WEEE which presents a health and safety risk unless such contamination is his or her liability under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980. To minimise the regulatory burden of the WEEE directive, the draft regulations propose to allow retailers to avail of an exemption from the normal waste permitting requirements for the storage and transport of WEEE in certain circumstances. Under the modified regime, which will be considerably less burdensome than the normal collection and waste permitting requirements, retailers will be required to register their premises with their local authority.</P>
        <P>Batteries not contained within a piece of electronic equipment are outside the scope of the directive although the removal and separate treatment of batteries in WEEE brought to treatment facilities is required. Insurance considerations are matters for individual retailers. Planning permission is required for a change of use of land or structure only where the use has in fact changed and the change has a material impact in planning terms.</P>
        <P>Currently, retailers take back WEEE, or faulty or damaged goods, from consumers. From 13 August, provisions in this area are being extended to the take-back of WEEE on a one-for-one basis. The directive also involves a shared responsibility approach by the various stake<Col N="1006"/>holders, including retailers, who will have an important role in ensuring effective implementation and operation of the directive. I am satisfied the draft legislation strikes the right balance between the responsibilities of the relevant stakeholders.</P>

	<P>Primary responsibility for the environmentally sound management of waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, rests with producers in line with the producer responsibility obligations imposed by the relevant EU directive. According to draft legislation, producers will be required to finance the collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal of WEEE deposited by retailers and members of the public at collection facilities and to achieve prescribed recovery targets. This will include responsibility on the basis of producers&rsquo; current market share for historic WEEE which is WEEE arising from products placed on the market prior to 13 August 2005. This will also include taking responsibility for WEEE where producers no longer exist or cannot be traced.</P>
        <P>From 13 August next when the directive comes into force, retailers will be required to take back household WEEE on a one-for-one basis when selling new equipment as long as the waste electrical and electronic equipment is of equivalent type or has fulfilled the same function as the equipment being supplied. The vendor of the original equipment is not relevant and the retailer cannot impose any charge for WEEE taken back on a one-for-one basis.</P>

Such inquiries could be inquiries on the status of a planning application or requests to speed up the processing of an application or correspondence supporting an application or a resubmission by an observer in general terms without elaborating on grounds.</P>
        <P>Where a public representative makes a formal submission which elaborates on the grounds of an application or an objection or on a submission by an observer or raises a substantive new issue, the submission cannot be considered by the planning authority unless it is accompanied by the appropriate &euro;20 fee. It is a matter for individual local authorities to put in place arrangements to implement the above.</P>

	<P>Legal advice has been sought on a variety of matters including, <i>inter alia</i>, representation of the Department in any litigation actions taken against it, advice on the drafting of legislation and the transposition of EU Directives, representation of the Department in arbitration hearings and various other activities related to the general administration of the Department. In the period from 1998 to date, legal advice has been procured on 69 occasions, accounting for payments of &euro;1,375,396.76. This does not include payments in relation to the planning tribunal. Although this constitutes the great bulk of fees paid out by my Department to law<Col N="1011"/>yers, the procurement of legal advice for the tribunal is not carried out by my Department.</P>
        <P>My Department employs a legal adviser recruited in accordance with Civil Service procedures. While arrangements for the procurement of any further legal advice required is decided on a case-by-case basis, legal services are generally engaged following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General and, or, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. Nominations or appointments and decisions on the level of fees paid are made or advised by those offices on the basis of a range of criteria, including the nature and urgency of the case, the strategies and objectives being pursued, the expertise and experience required, the availability of such expertise and the costs involved.</P>

	<P>Details of the number of housing units provided under the various affordable schemes in each local authority area are published in my Department&rsquo;s housing statistics bulletins. Information is already available to September quarter 2004, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.

        <P>The construction targets for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes are 1,000 each per annum as set out in the national development plan. As output under Part V and the affordable housing initiative is dependent on the number and type of planning applications made and the nature of agreements entered into by developers and local authorities, similar annual construction targets cannot be set.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 811 and 834 together.</P>
        <P>The following table sets out current guidelines to planning authorities, to which, under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard in the performance of their functions. My Department and I regularly engage with planning authorities on the implementation of planning guidelines, for example, through forums such as regular meetings with the City and <Col N="1017"/>County Managers Association and briefing sessions for local authority officials, and by commenting on draft development plans.</P>
        <P>With regard to draft guidelines, the final draft of the wind energy guidelines which will replace the existing guidelines published in 1996 are at an advanced stage of preparation. It is normal practice, and in line with the principles of better regulation, to issue ministerial planning guidelines in draft form and to take into account any submissions made when finalising the text. This process is now nearly complete and I intend to publish the final guidelines very soon. Given that this is normal practice, I am not aware of any confusion among planning authorities in advance of the final text being published.</P>
        <P>A public consultation draft of revised development management guidelines, replacing and updating the 1982 development control advice and guidelines, and draft development plan guidelines, will be published in the coming weeks. Preliminary work on drafting guidelines in respect of public safety zones at State airports has begun; it is intended to publish them for public consultation later this year. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On 12 April 2005, the Government approved a national programme for the progressive reduction of emissions of the four transboundary pollutants, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and ammonia. The National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2004 specify national emission ceilings for the above four pollutants to be achieved by 2010. A number of measures which would tie in with the achievement of the ceilings were already being actively pursued under existing and planned legislation and policies, including cleaner fuels and vehicles, integrated pollution control licensing, organic solvent emissions reduction and a voluntary agreement with the solid fuel industry.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department also submitted a national emission reduction plan for large combustion plants to the European Commission. The plan, under Directive 2001/80/EC on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plants with a rated thermal input greater than 50 MW, requires significant reductions of emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from older ESB power plants and boilers in Aughinish Alumina from 2008.</P>
        <P>The national programme sets out a number of significant developments in policies and measures in various sectors since 2003. The downward emissions trend evident since 2001 is projected to continue to 2010, though it is clear that the nitrogen oxides ceiling in annexe 1 to Directive 2001/81/EC presents a significant difficulty for Ireland and that measures to achieve it could be disproportionately costly.</P>
        <P>Directive 2001/81/EC will be reviewed by the European Commission in 2006, taking into account the clean air for Europe, CAFE, programme on the thematic strategy on air pollution due to be published later in 2005. The thematic strategy will address environmental objectives up to 2020, building on existing 2010 objectives including emission ceilings in Directive 2001/81/EC. Ireland&rsquo;s national programme, which will be updated in 2006, indicates significant <Col N="1021"/>ongoing progress to date and is an important milestone with a view to a future national emissions reduction strategy. Details of the national programme can be accessed on-line at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 819 to 821, inclusive, and 823 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998. Progress towards ratification of the convention is closely aligned with work at EU level. To date, the European Union has adopted two directives as part of the ratification process for the convention. These deal with public access to environmental information, 2003/4/EC, and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures, 2003/35/EC. Ratification of the convention will take place after these directives have been transposed into Irish law.</P>
        <P>Work is continuing in my Department with regard to the transposition of the two directives and will be completed as soon as possible. While it is not planned to hold a formal public consultation process in regard to this process, my Department remains open to submissions from any interested parties or groups. When the above work on transposition is completed, the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention will be submitted to Government and laid before <Col N="1022"/>the D&aacute;il in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
        <P>My Department has not been in contact with State agencies generally about the transposition of Directive 2003/04/EC on public access to environmental information. In an informal communication with the Environmental Protection Agency, my Department drew attention to the distinction between EU regulations which have immediate effect and EU directives which require transposition.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The impact of peat extraction is a significant issue for raised bog habitats, of which 57 sites have been proposed as candidate special areas of conservation, SACs. Any commercial peat extraction on these sites has been stopped.</P>
        <P>Since 1999, owners of bog and turbary rights in these SACs have been advised generally that they may continue domestic turf cutting for up to ten years, except in particularly sensitive areas of the bog. Compensation has been provided to those agreeing to cease cutting. A formal licensing system has not been invoked, and consent has been given at a local level for domestic cutting, except where particularly sensitive areas of the bogs have been identified.</P>
        <P>My Department has commissioned surveys of continuing domestic turf cutting in these sites. Field survey work has been completed and a final report will be available by the end of this year. This will give a clear indication of the impact of all turf cutting on these sites and enable decisions to be taken on any necessary prioritisation of areas for cessation of domestic cutting.</P>

	<P>During the years 1992 to 1999, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, carried out a nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12-month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km x 10 km grid square <Col N="1024"/>throughout the country. The results of the survey were used to predict the percentage of houses in each grid square in which radon concentrations in excess of 200 becquerels per cubic metre, Bq/m3, which is the national reference level. Grid squares where this percentage is greater than 10% are designated as high radon areas. The survey was on domestic dwellings only but in a high radon area it is reasonable to expect that workplaces would also be at risk of exceeding the relevant reference level. Employers would be well advised to carry out surveys in these circumstances in the interests of health and safety. The RPII&rsquo;s website, <i>www.rpii.ie,</i> contains a comprehensive map which shows these high radon locations throughout the country. County radon maps and survey results can be viewed also on that website by clicking on the county by name.</P>
        <P>Epidemiological studies have shown that naturally occurring radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer and that the incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers. However, it is not possible to attribute any one case of lung cancer to radon exposure. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish the impact of radon gas in any particular area from the impact of other carcinogenic substances that may also be present, most notably tobacco smoke.</P>
        <P>Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon, to urge householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the national reference level to undertake the appropriate remediation works.</P>

	<P>Air quality assessment is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and air quality management a matter for local authorities informed by air quality measurement data. The EPA has a statutory duty under the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 to make information available on ambient concentrations of all pollutants under the scope of the regulations. The EPA website provides real-time, publicly accessible, data from a number of monitoring stations nationally which allows the public to gauge air quality in relation to current EU and national <Col N="1025"/>standards. Alert thresholds for certain pollutants are in place for the purpose of triggering immediate action by the agency to inform the public where such thresholds are exceeded.</P>
        <P>Where the indicative level for any pollutant has been exceeded, the 2002 regulations place primary responsibility, following notification by the agency, on the relevant local authorities for the development of long term air quality management plans to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants. To date, no local authority has been notified by the agency to prepare such plans.</P>
        <P>Where there is a future risk of a pollutant threshold being exceeded and the agency considers measures are likely to be needed in the short term, the agency is expected to notify the relevant local authorities to prepare a short-term air pollution action plan to reduce the risk of a threshold being exceeded. The agency has on just one occasion to date on 20 April 2005, notified a local authority, Dublin City Council, of the need to prepare a short-term air pollution action plan to address a likely future exceedance of particulate matter at one monitoring station based on a comparison of the 2003 monitoring data with the limit values applying from 1 January 2005.</P>
        <P>The EPA&rsquo;s air quality and emissions to air report 2003 contains details of the monitoring and assessment of national air quality and incorporates data from all air quality monitoring stations operated by the EPA and local authorities. The report states that the limit values for pollutants under the EU directives on ambient air quality were not exceeded in 2003. The report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

	<P>My Department carries out a survey of the total amount of serviced land zoned for residential purposes, owned both privately and by local authorities. This survey is valuable in assessing the overall stock of land at the same point each year, and the sufficiency of that stock to underpin required housing supply.</P>
        <P>Since 2003, the Department has extended this survey to collate data on the amount of residentially zoned land owned directly by each local authority. However, we are not satisfied that the information received in its present form gives the overall picture of residentially zoned lands held by local authorities. We therefore intend to develop the 2005 survey further to improve the reliability and usefulness of the information to be collected. This analysis would only provide a point in time assessment, as variation could be <Col N="1027"/>expected from year to year as lands are developed, particularly for social and affordable housing schemes. The value of local authority lands is reflected in their assets registers, which now form part of the authorities&rsquo; annual accounts.  The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach recently announced a number of new housing initiatives, including the establishment of the affordable homes partnership, AHP, to drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, with particular reference to the Dublin metropolitan area. The AHP will be tasked to undertake a series of measures to bring additional land forward for housing development. As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximise the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s local authorities loan system has helped significant numbers of low-income households to purchase their own homes under a range of targeted schemes including the shared ownership and 1999 affordable housing schemes. In July of last year I carried out a review of the loan and income limits which resulted in an increase in the maximum loan available for the acquisition or construction of a house to &euro;165,000.</P>
        <P>The income eligibility limit for applying for a house purchase loan was increased to &euro;36,800 for a single-income household. In the case of a two-<Col N="1028"/>income household, both incomes are assessed in determining eligibility on the basis of a formula whereby two and a half times the main income and once the second income cannot exceed &euro;92,000. My Department will continue to keep the terms and conditions of this scheme under review.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department is involved in extensive discussions with a number of leading private lending institutions with a view to their providing mortgage finance, subject to their normal lending criteria, to applicants who have been allocated an affordable housing unit for purchase under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004 or the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. To date, agreement has been reached with Bank of Ireland Mortgage Bank. Discussions are ongoing with a number of other lenders and I anticipate that these will be successfully concluded in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s overall housing strategy is to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers. A range of measures implemented by the Government has focused on increasing the supply of residential land through investment in infrastructure, using land more effectively through higher residential densities and the introduction of a range of measures to expand the capacity of the planning system. Arising from this strategy, 2004 was a further record year for house completions, which totalled 76,954, an increase of 11.8% on 2003. Approximately 500,000 houses have been built over the past ten years, representing over 30% of the Irish housing stock.</P>
        <P>This increased supply, supported by Government measures, means the market is supplying houses in many parts of the country at affordable prices. In addition to measures to support a market response to the unprecedented demand, a range of targeted affordable housing measures has been promoted by the Government. We announced further measures last week to accelerate the delivery of affordable housing. These included the establishment of the affordable housing partnership and the advancement of AHI projects on a number of sites through land swaps.</P>
        <P>As part of the broader delivery of housing nationally, all local authorities will review their land management strategies to maximize the availability of land for their own housing programmes, voluntary and co-operative housing, <Col N="1029"/>housing partnerships with the private sector and to secure more active use of brownfield land and derelict sites.</P>
        <P>The Government has also responded actively to increased levels of social housing need by expanding social and affordable housing output. In the current year, the Government is allocating record levels of funding to local authorities for their social and affordable housing programmes. The total Exchequer capital and current funding available for social and affordable housing in 2005 will amount to &euro;1.3 billion which represents an increase of 20% on 2004. Total capital spending on social and affordable housing output in 2005, inclusive of non-Exchequer financing, will amount to almost &euro;2 billion.</P>
        <P>In order to ensure a systematic and integrated approach to the use of these resources, local authorities have, at my Department&rsquo;s request, developed new five-year action plans for social and affordable housing. I believe that the preparation of these plans will sharpen the identification of priority needs, and help to ensure a more coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including those to be provided by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. My Department is giving strong encouragement to local authorities to press ahead with the implementation of these action plans, which are being underpinned by very substantial levels of Government funding. To underpin the multi-annual approach in the action plans I have secured financial envelopes for the next five years.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 the needs of 86,000 households have been met, taking account of local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under both social and affordable housing measures. Overall, in 2005, it is anticipated that the needs of in excess of 13,000 households will be met through the same measures. In addition, it is anticipated that a number of households currently in private rented accommodation will transfer to the new rental accommodation scheme now being introduced. These households will continue to be accommodated mainly within the private rented sector.</P>

        <P>Under the Derelict Sites Act 1990, local authorities have a range of powers to deal with derel<Col N="1032"/>ict sites within their functional areas. It is also open to Kildare County Council to seek to have Kilcock prescribed as an urban area within the meaning of the 1990 Act, for the purpose of applying a derelict site levy to relevant properties.</P>
        <P>The disposal of local authority property is primarily a matter for the authority concerned. I have no information concerning the future use of the library site to which the Deputy refers.</P>
        <P>A total on ten sites in Kilcock were designated for the purpose of the town renewal scheme, which was introduced in 2000 with the aim of revitalising the built fabric of smaller towns throughout the country. Under this scheme, which expires on 31 July 2006, tax incentives are available in respect of residential and commercial development within these designated areas.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Studies have not been carried out in Ireland on the possible link between levels of radon gas in homes, schools or workplaces and various forms of cancer.</P>
        <P>Epidemiological studies have shown that naturally occurring radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer and that the incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers. However, it is not possible to attribute any one case of lung cancer to radon exposure. Therefore, it is currently not possible to distinguish the impact of radon gas in any particular area from the impact of other carcinogenic substances that may also be present, most notably tobacco smoke.</P>
        <P>To date, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has carried out 776 radon measurements in homes in County Kildare. Of these, 41 were found to be above the national reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre, with the highest level being 1,114 becquerels per cubic metre. As part of a nationwide survey of schools carried out at the request of the Department of Education and Science in the period 1998 to 2001, the RPII measured radon gas levels in 126 schools in the county. Of these, 24 schools had radon levels above the national reference level in at least one room. The Department of Education and Science has provided funding for remedial measures in all schools affected. The RPII has also carried out radon measurement in 12 workplaces in Kildare. One of these workplaces was found to have radon levels above the national reference level of 400 becquerels per cubic metre for workplaces. I should mention that as the RPII is not the only organisation carrying out a radon measurement service, the actual number of workplaces that have been measured may be greater.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On 23 January 2003, the European Commission issued Ireland with a reasoned opinion to the effect that the &euro;20 fee for the making of a submission on a planning application which requires environmental impact assessment is contrary to the public participation provisions of Directive 85/337/EEC on environmental impact assessment, EIA. A reply issued to the European Commission on 16 May 2003, responding to each of the points raised in the reasoned opinion and setting out our contention that the imposition of a &euro;20 participation fee is not in conflict with the provisions of the directive.</P>
        <P>The European Commission lodged an application with the European Court of Justice on 17 May 2005 initiating proceedings against Ireland on this matter. My Department is examining relevant papers. I have no plans at this time to amend the concerned regulations which reflect an approach endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>It is matter for the European Court of Justice to schedule a hearing on this case and my Department does not yet have information on when this will take place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of local authorities operate a scheme whereby elderly persons who own an existing house can apply for a local authority tenancy and sell their house to the authority at a reduced market value. The scheme allows elderly persons to move to accommodation better suited to their needs, generally with access to better services. At the same time, it provides the local authority with access to under occupied family type housing for renting to families on their waiting list. The operation of such schemes is a matter for individual local authorities. It is understood that neither Sligo County Council nor Sligo Borough Council operates this scheme. It would be necessary for local authorities that wish to operate this scheme to include its provisions as <Col N="1035"/>part of their scheme of letting priorities for local authority housing. The making or amending of schemes of letting priorities is a reserved function of the elected members of individual councils.</P>
