      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 34, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Last week, in the course of Private Members&rsquo; business, we had the opportunity to address comprehensively developments in the peace process, and the agreed motion received the overwhelming endorsement of the parties in this House. Without restating the text of that motion, it is clear that we all want to protect and develop the achievements of the Good Friday Agreement and to continue to work to secure its full implementation.</P>
        <P>The agreement must form the basis of a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. The Government&rsquo;s proposals published in December addressed the key issues that we had identified as being necessary to make progress. Regrettably, however, we could not secure agreement on two key issues: an end to all forms of paramilitary and criminal activity, and decommissioning.</P>
        <P>The Northern Bank robbery brought into sharp relief the need to address and resolve these key issues if trust is to be restored. That was the emphatic message that the Government conveyed to the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership when we met in January. The same clear message was imparted by Prime Minister Blair and it was the message that both Governments conveyed publicly after we met in Downing Street on 1 February.</P>
        <P>At my meeting with the Prime Minister, I raised with him the issue of an apology for the Conlon and Maguire families and I am grateful to him for his prompt response. I also raised our concerns about the British response to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of the early 1970s and separate questions have been tabled on this issue. The Prime Minister and I will continue to meet as and when necessary.</P>
        <P>The two Governments published the latest report from the Independent Monitoring Commission whose representatives I met recently. The conclusions drawn by the independent commission concur with the intelligence available to both Governments concerning the Northern Bank robbery and other incidents in Northern Ireland. The findings of the report underline the clear need for the issue of IRA paramilitarism, including all forms of criminal activity, to be resolved satisfactorily once and for all.</P>
        <P>At my most recent meetings with the parties, we discussed recent developments and possible ways of moving the process forward. Both I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will continue our contacts with them in the period ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Following the publication of the Independent Monitoring Commission&rsquo;s report, has the Taoiseach spoken to Prime Minister Blair about it? Has the Government considered the findings of the report and, if so, what action does it propose to take?</P><Col N="1201"/>
        <P>Has any evidence or information been given to the Government about the brutal murder of Robert McCartney in Belfast? Has the Government considered any action it might be able to take to assist in the detection of those responsible? I welcome the statement by the president of Sinn F&eacute;in asking that persons who might have any information about this matter should relay it to the authorities. That is to be commended. The nature, timing and brutality of this murder and the fact that there are allegations that the persons responsible were able to return to the public house and clean the place out forensically mean that this is a crime of the most serious type. The Taoiseach may wish to respond to those two points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government considered and discussed the IMC report last Tuesday, before its publication. These reports are normally given to both Governments some days beforehand. Obviously, the report highlights the need to keep the implementation process on track and to continue with all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, even if it takes some time to make progress on the political issues, given the impending local elections and possibly the Westminster elections.</P>
        <P>As regards the McCartney killing, the PSNI has refused to comment on the basis that the investigation is ongoing. Therefore, there have been no reports or intelligence on this matter, other than what has been in the media. As the Deputy said, the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Gerry Adams, has repudiated the killing in very strong terms, and has said that people who have reservations about assisting the PSNI should give any information to the family&rsquo;s solicitor or any other authoritative person or body. The chief constable of the PSNI stated that it was not a crime by some political group in furtherance of its objectives but that it involved people who belong to illegal organisations. That is as far as he went.</P>
        <P>The issue for us, as we prepare for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, is to take the issues on which progress has been made and, over the next few months, make as much progress on them as we can. We hope to have a substantive agenda for the conference, which the Secretary of State, Mr. Paul Murphy, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comments. Mark Durkan, the leader of the SDLP, called for the reconvening of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation so that persuasive discussion could take place in an atmosphere that would lessen tensions arising from recent difficulties. Has the Government considered this? Will the Taoiseach agree to this? Mr. Durkan&rsquo;s call was echoed by me and others in the House last week.</P>
        <P>Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform reported on the activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau in respect of recipients and beneficiaries of the illegal proceeds of paramilitary <Col N="1202"/>criminality? The CAB has done a fabulous job in tackling crime in general by sitting on drug barons and confiscating their assets. Will the bureau be given the resources to deal with the beneficiaries of paramilitary criminality?</P>
        <P>The <i>Limerick Leader</i> reported this week, probably following reports in the Sunday newspapers, that the McCabe issue might be revisited. Will the Taoiseach reiterate that this issue is off the table and, in his own words, that he does not see it coming back on the table again?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the questions in reverse order. There is no change in the position on the latter issue. I can see that people want to nail things down to the last degree. I do not have a changed position. I do not want to engage wordsmiths on this but it is off the table and that is it.</P>
        <P>On the Criminal Assets Bureau, assets accumulated through criminal conduct by persons involved in paramilitary organisations are among those that have been investigated in recent years. In particular, many of the cross-Border cases involved people with past or current paramilitary links. A major joint initiative between the law enforcement authorities, North and South, has been undertaken, which has resulted in joint investigations on both sides of the Border. The CAB has worked with the Assets Recovery Agency and, in some cases, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland customs in carrying out processes in parallel in both jurisdictions. Assets have been frozen in both jurisdictions and a number of people face charges.</P>
        <P>The legislation used by the CAB was amended in the past few days to allow criminality outside the jurisdiction to be taken into account and to allow the bureau to work more closely with the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland. These changes will help the CAB to examine assets with a paramilitary origin. The bureau keeps its resources under review in light of its workload but I understand there is no difficulty currently in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I will have to consult the chairperson. It is a long time since we met. I have an open enough mind if we can frame a helpful, constructive and useful agenda. If, in the few months prior to the British election, it turned into a criticising match, it would not serve any purpose. Perhaps the convenors could examine this. The Deputy will recall the difficulty in the forum&rsquo;s previous life was not alone the non-attendance of the Unionist parties, but their comments outside it, which were not always useful. If we can have a constructive agenda, I have an open mind on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I return to the ghoulish murder of Robert McCartney? The Taoiseach seemed to suggest that although the information in the public domain is that this savage killing was carried out by members of the republican movement, they were not on a mission sanctioned by <Col N="1203"/>the republican movement. Is that not the point, that this type of thuggish behaviour is being used to control communities in Northern Ireland? It is at least as offensive to me as robbing the Northern Bank that domination and sway is held over certain communities by sheer intimidation. In these circumstances, according to what is in the public domain, a number of people went back to the pub, took out the video tape that might be of use in prosecuting these terrible offences &mdash; Brendan Devine was also seriously injured in the circumstances &mdash; and cleaned the place forensically, as adverted to by Deputy Kenny. Is this Tony Soprano style killing not sufficient reason alone for the democratic parties and the two Governments to break the power of the republican movement in controlling paramilitary activity, even when not on an officially sanctioned job?</P>
        <P>I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about the story that appeared in <i>The Star. </i>It was reported that the wife of one of the prisoners convicted for the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, apparently a councillor in County Cavan, said, more or less, that the Taoiseach did not know what he was talking about and that she was satisfied that her husband would be released early. Will the Taoiseach address that?</P>
        <P>Is the provision the Taoiseach announced previously in terms of the side agreements with Sinn F&eacute;in and representation in the Oireachtas also off the table in the current context?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct on the McCartney issue. Anything that involves people using heavy-handed action is wrong. I want to remain consistent with my statements. The PSNI refused to comment on the basis that the investigation is ongoing. The only two statements the Chief Constable has made on this, or that have been passed because they were in the public domain and were not in any way confidential, are that it was not a crime by some political group in furtherance of its objectives but it did involve people who belong to an illegal organisation. Regardless of whether they belonged to an illegal organisation, a crime like that, where a person is stabbed to death and another &mdash; Brendan Devine &mdash; badly injured, is horrific. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s comment. The Chief Constable also said there had been intimidation of people who might be able to help the police. He said &ldquo;might be able&rdquo; and was not very firm on that. Police who carried out searches in the area were attacked by stone throwing youths. There were widespread reports in Belfast that senior members of the IRA were involved and the crime was cleaned up afterwards. As I said to Deputy Kenny, the PSNI has not given detailed reports to us on these matters.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte and others on Northern Ireland, that in many ways some of these issues are more serious from the perspective of the Nationalist com<Col N="1204"/>munity than a bank raid. A bank raid does not affect people as much, other than the two families affected by the robbery, but this kind of behaviour does. That is the reason we need an end to criminality. I agree with that. I do not wish to wind these things up again but the point we have been making is that it is not just a question of money or petrol. A person has been stabbed to death and that is much worse. That is not to say the other acts are not bad, but it is much worse that somebody is dead. That is the reason and motivation for wanting to see an end to all these for everybody&rsquo;s sake, not least the people in Nationalist communities who are being affected in this particular instance.</P>
        <P>On the McCabe issue, those responsible have release dates and will be released when those dates are reached. That is the position. Some of those dates are soon and some of them are not, &ldquo;soon&rdquo; meaning in a few years&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>I have given no more thought to the question of Oireachtas representation. Naturally it would be a good development were we to achieve a comprehensive agreement, and we should still be able to do that although it would be in the context of a comprehensive agreement. It was only ever considered when the parties looked at this in the context of the Agreement back in 2001 and early 2002. It was on the basis of us having normality, and I hope we will return to that situation. I do not see a difficulty in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach expect any evolution in this impasse, although I do not think one can have evolution in an impasse? Are there likely to be any developments between now and the British general election? How does the Taoiseach see the way forward? In particular, will he give a commitment to the House that he will involve the SDLP more centrally from here on? He is as familiar as I am, or more so, with the manner in which the SDLP feels it has been essentially excluded from the real negotiations. Given that party&rsquo;s democratic credentials down through the years, it deserves better than that.</P>
        <P>In terms of an earlier reply from the Taoiseach, has the Criminal Assets Bureau been asked to investigate the issue of republican funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As to where we go from here, a number of issues are being dealt with. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is preparing the agenda for the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We are trying to get as comprehensive an agenda as possible. At this stage that is the only forum in which we can progress matters with the British Government, and we want to progress a number of issues. Many issues in the various processes have been stalled or delayed and we want to try to make progress on them.</P>
        <P>The care and maintenance issues of the North-South bodies are still outstanding. Useful work is taking place in that regard even though it is progressing more slowly than we would like. We <Col N="1205"/>still intend driving these matters forward. Co-operation is ongoing on a number of aspects regarding police oversight. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in Northern Ireland next week for meetings on that matter. Other Ministers are involved in their individual areas of co-operation. We can usefully do a number of things.</P>
        <P>We will continue to make as much progress as we can within the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The Government remains committed to the Agreement and to the principle of parallel consent that underpins it. That principle creates a problem in that if trust and confidence are not built up, one cannot do many of the things one would wish to do. This has been the difficulty since the assembly collapsed. Since then we have endeavoured to pursue three major initiatives, namely, the joint declaration, the sequence of the autumn of 2003 and the document of 8 December, which address the outstanding issues, namely, decommissioning, ending paramilitary activity, completion of the policing project and ensuring stable institutions. We will continue to try to make whatever progress we can, to engage with all the parties and see what work we can do even if, as Deputy Rabbitte suggested, we are unlikely to get back to the comprehensive agreement in the next few months. Everyone accepts that position but it does not mean we will do nothing &mdash; we can continue to engage.</P>
        <P>The most recent negotiations failed because agreement could not be reached on the transparency elements of the process of arms decommissioning because the IRA was unwilling to commit itself to clearly and definitively ending criminal activity. Nevertheless, the good side was that both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in signed up to the many political aspects of the comprehensive agreement, including the policing provisions, which I do not want to lose because we worked on them from the talks at Weston Park. We now have agreement on the issue, which is a significant and encouraging element. We got close to resolving many of the issues.</P>
        <P>I understand that among the assets investigated by the Criminal Assets Bureau in recent years have been those accumulated through criminal conduct by persons involved in paramilitary organisations. The CAB has our absolute support in dealing with those issues and for its activities in that regard. I do not know what are its achievements but it is involved in activity and is co-operating with the Assets Recovery Agency in Northern Ireland. Progress is being made in terms of these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I was glad to hear the Taoiseach recognise in his contribution the difference between a stabbing and a robbery and state that a physical assault is worse in terms of a &ldquo;moral league&rdquo;, if one can call it that. However, did he really mean to refer to the bank robbery as showing the problem with the peace process in sharp relief, a statement which surprised me? Does he <Col N="1206"/>agree that the punishment beatings show the problem in sharp relief too? Perhaps he needs to put the two issues in the same phrase at least if he is making a reference to such a key issue or event.</P>
        <P>Does the Government clearly distinguish between a conflict resolution process and a post-conflict situation? There has been some mixing of the interpretation of the two concepts which does not help us to reach the point at which we have a resolved conflict. Will the Taoiseach explain the Government&rsquo;s view on the matter given that it appears different Ministers might have different views on whether we are engaged in a conflict resolution process or a post-conflict situation?</P>
        <P>Given that the Good Friday Agreement, which all Members wholeheartedly support and want to see implemented, is stuck on strand one, can strands two and three be given any hope of proceeding as quickly as possible in the areas of justice, human rights, cross-Border institutions and so on in order to give hope to people who are yearning and grasping for whatever hope can be engendered?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I acknowledge that it is not the Government&rsquo;s decision but the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view is important in regard to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Does he support the proposal to reconstitute the forum so that not just the parties in this House or the Government but rather all parties, including the SDLP, other constitutional parties and all those in civic society who have a role to play, could be involved in pushing forward our agreements rather than our disagreements? Can this be implemented as soon as possible given the sense of despair which is beginning to grow in respect of the whole process?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I said earlier that the bank robbery in Northern Ireland brought into sharp relief the need to address and resolve the key issues if trust is to be restored. That applies to assaults on people or other aspects which damage the process. I think everybody agrees with that.</P>
        <P>I do not want the forum to meet if there is no great purpose in doing so. If people believe that forum meetings with an agreed agenda can help towards the goal of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, let us hold them. Otherwise I am not sure there is a purpose in doing so. If the convenors want to discuss holding meetings which would be worthwhile, I have an open mind on that.</P>
        <P>I apologise for not replying fully to Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question regarding the SDLP, which Deputy Sargent also touched on. I do not feel that people are excluded from discussing any issue. In terms of the process in Northern Ireland, if one does not meet people on almost the same day as one meets someone else, people feel excluded. That is the nature of how things happen, with somebody or some small parties feeling excluded. It is not possible to meet everyone together. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="1207"/>and I do our best and have done over the years to keep closely in touch with the parties. In the period up to the end of 2003, the parties felt excluded because they thought we gave all our time to working with the two parties which were then in the key positions, the UUP and the SDLP. That situation changed last year to include the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in so naturally we gave a lot of time to them. We did not do so, however, to the exclusion of the other parties.</P>
        <P>I take the point and I assure the House that we do our best to keep all the parties involved all the time. The difficulty is that round table discussions, which would make my life much easier, do not work because for obvious reasons one cannot get people around the table. Over the years some parties, by and large not the Nationalist parties, have contributed more than others to that problem, but I will not get into that. That is a difficulty. Mr. Blair and I have tried on many occasions to organise round table discussions, but someone fails to turn up and the story then revolves around that, which does not help the process.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte is right that the SDLP has played a huge positive and constructive role in the peace process at all levels over the years and we have never deliberately left it out of the process. We treat the smaller Unionist parties and the Alliance Party similarly because we take an even-handed approach to dealing with the situation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach to note my abhorrence and that of Sinn F&eacute;in of the brutal murder of Robert McCartney, and our absolute rejection of this terrible deed. I repeat the call of Gerry Adams for people to assist the family in any and every way they can in its quest for truth and justice in this case.</P>
        <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in an interview in<i> Irish News </i>last Friday, 11 February, the Chief Constable of the PSNI, Huge Orde, was asked if the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership knew about the Northern Ireland bank robbery and he replied that he had no idea? How does the Taoiseach square that with his own claims? He has supposedly based his opinion heretofore on PSNI information. His view is that the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership was in some way involved or conspired with others to carry out the Northern Bank robbery. I have addressed this issue with the Taoiseach previously. Is it not clear from all that has been said by the former Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, the former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and now by Hugh Orde himself, that there is no basis to the charge, which is political and without any basis in fact? I appeal to the Taoiseach calmly to <Col N="1208"/>recognise and appreciate the importance of clarity on this specific issue.</P>
        <P>Has the Taoiseach raised with the British Government the admission by a representative of MI5 at a British House of Commons committee meeting that it had planted electronic listening devices at the Connolly House offices of Sinn F&eacute;in in Belfast? The Taoiseach will recall that we raised this matter in the House at the time. There was some dismissal of the claims that we made. However, they have been vindicated, and I believe the Taoiseach was present when the apparatus was returned at the Leeds Castle engagement in which I also participated.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that the institutions were brought down by the British Government regarding another so-called &ldquo;spying&rdquo; allegation which is, as yet, unproven? One of the parties to the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government, through its arm, MI5, has admitted it was directly involved in eavesdropping on another party to that Agreement and the ongoing discussions and negotiations, the party I represent. Has the Taoiseach raised the issue? Does he agree that its acknowledgement now is very damaging and that he should insist to the British Prime Minister that it must never be repeated?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge what Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has said about the murder of Mr. McCartney, reiterating what the president of Sinn F&eacute;in, Gerry Adams, has said. That is helpful. On Connolly House, I recall raising the issue on the day in September at Leeds Castle when the device was handed over by the Deputy and his colleagues. We raised the matter then and made it clear that the idea of using bugging devices anywhere was totally unhelpful. As the Deputy will recall, it was not admitted at the time, when the British professed to have no knowledge of it. I will have to check with the Secretariat to follow that up, but we conveyed our abhorrence at the use of such tactics by MI5 or MI6 on the day.</P>
        <P>I read the interview with Hugh Orde last week. He is not a politician, and he made his professional assessment very clear when he met the British Prime Minister and me in the presence of the Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, and some of my colleagues. Of course, the difficulty for me is that the only way that I can get intelligence &mdash; the reason that I refused to make it up earlier today &mdash; is when it is presented to me with a categoric assurance. Then one must either say nothing about it, which is what I did many times last year, or one must express it, which is what I did in this instance this year. That is the position, and I cannot change that unless either one or both individuals does so. The more I say about it, the worse I make it, so I will say no more.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, to this day in both Protestant and Catholic areas, loyalist and republican paramilitary organisations, leaving aside major criminal acts, have a heavy hand on their respective communities, <Col N="1209"/>interfering with the democratic rights and free expression of groups and political organisations opposed to them? This is manifested in many invidious ways, even in terms of making it difficult to book community halls for meetings or distribute leaflets freely. The Taoiseach appears to have ignored that in the talks, at least until the time they broke down. I put it to the Taoiseach that his Government and the British Government have been somewhat hypocritical in that they have been quiet on this issue but also on major criminal jobs, for example, the Makro and Gallahers robberies, which many believe were carried out by republicans, because talks were still going on. When they broke down, however, they jumped all over the IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in over the Northern Bank job.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Northern Bank robbery, there are not many people in Belfast who do not believe the IRA did it, but as a member of the Socialist Party, a small party whose members North and South slog around from door to door in winter and summer to get small amounts of money to fund our political activities, I do not recognise the legitimacy of any group to kidnap and rob to back political activity. Will the Taoiseach agree, however, it is extremely dangerous to go down the road of mere assertion of guilt by senior police officers or indeed the International Monitoring Committee instead of producing proof and is not a precedent with which we want to go forward? Will he agree that proof and evidence should be brought forward, that trial and convictions should follow and that the idea, for political reasons, of assertion of guilt should not become a norm? On the killing of Robert McCartney, those who did that bestial act should be put on trial but can the State guarantee the safety of those who can come forward to give evidence to do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the issue of exclusion, will the Taoiseach agree that, with the benefit of hindsight, it was a tactical mistake to allow the agenda for the talks which were abruptly terminated before Christmas to be set by the parties of the extreme? Moderate parties such as the SDLP, the UUP and others, which were the main architects of the Good Friday Agreement, were virtually excluded and sidelined. The DUP is on record as having pledged to wreck the Good Friday Agreement, and I do not know whether Sinn F&eacute;in signed it. Will the Taoiseach agree that in future negotiations a more central and meaningful role should be given to the parties of the centre which were the architects of the Good Friday Agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Deputy Joe Higgins&rsquo;s question first, if we follow the process over a number of years, and I say this in a serious way, it was a process of trying to get away from a situation where people on all sides were being killed almost nightly and where there were incidents of maiming, burning and other serious <Col N="1210"/>issues, and trying to build a peace process. That was done. We then tried to build co-operation at the interfaces, de-escalate the tensions of the marching season, stop the number of shootings and beatings and all of those issues. Over the years, the effort incrementally was to change all those positions and when one position was completed, we moved on to the next series of offences. It is true that as we were going through the process year by year, we were making progress incrementally. Other issues were overlooked because there was a question over which acts were the most serious or vicious, and their effect on people&rsquo;s lives and homes.</P>
        <P>In recent years we argued about trying to make progress in respect of policing and this was something we achieved in December. We made such progress because if there was no policing in communities, people were taking the law into their own hands or using what they believed to be corrective action against youths in their areas. The only way to deal with the problems in such communities was to have a proper police force. That was why we invested so much effort into policing.</P>
        <P>The issue of acts of completion is outstanding but, as with moving towards the end of criminality, we are making a great deal of progress in respect of it. These were the final matters on the list and the Deputy is correct that action was forthcoming in respect of some issues. If we had tried to take action on all of them at the same time, we could never have been able to so. It was not that they were ignored to the extent that nobody cared about them, it was merely the case that progress had to be made in other areas.</P>
        <P>I hope that Northern Ireland will some day soon reach a position where, as is the case in the normal world of law and order and respect therefor, people will feel free to give evidence and prosecutions will take place. I will not comment on particular cases but, unfortunately, there is intimidation by loyalists and republicans of witnesses in many cases. This may also occur in criminal cases, in which those involved may not be affiliated to either side. That creates difficulties and may lead to evidence not being produced. I could cite many cases in which this type of behaviour takes place.</P>
        <P>As regards acts of completion and everything that has been said since 8 December, the process in this regard did not start on that date. Since autumn 2002, we have been discussing acts of completion in terms of what these mean and how they will be achieved. I acknowledge the huge amount of work carried out in March 2003, October 2003 and during all 2004 was about those issues. It is not the case that these matters arose after 8 December.</P>
        <P>On Deputy McGinley&rsquo;s point, we were accused in 2003 of devoting all our time to the SDLP and the UUP and not dealing with other issues, except in respect of issues with which they were not involved. I refer here to matters of decommissioning where these parties could not play a role because they did not have anything to <Col N="1211"/>decommission. Last year we were accused by others of not being involved as much. That was because the Good Friday Agreement ordained that &mdash; this was decided by the people &mdash; the two largest parties should bring together the Executive. We have, however, always tried to be inclusive and will continue to be so in respect of the SDLP and every other party.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 92 together.</P>
        <P>As regards the future of Aer Lingus, I reject any claims that there has been a delay on the part of Government to progress the matter. It is important that any decisions we reach about the company&rsquo;s future are correct and take account of the nature of the sector, the company business model, the needs of the economy and the views of stakeholders. In that context, as the House is aware, the Cabinet sub-committee and the Government considered the future of Aer Lingus in December last. Arising from that consideration, it was decided, in line with the terms of Sustaining Progress, to initiate a process of consultation with ICTU to assist in reaching an understanding on the airline&rsquo;s future funding requirements. In that regard, I met representatives of ICTU on 16 December 2004. Since then there has been intensive engagement between Aer Lingus and ICTU&rsquo;s financial advisers on the issue and I expect the process to conclude very shortly. When the process with ICTU is completed, I will reflect on its outcome in consultation with ICTU prior to making a further submission to Government on the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>On the second terminal issue, it is the policy of the Government to encourage as wide a range as possible of reliable, regular and competitive air services to and from Ireland. The central tenet of this policy is the belief that a strong, competitive <Col N="1212"/>and efficient network of air links is vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</P>
        <P>Passenger traffic through Dublin Airport is forecast to grow from last year&rsquo;s level of more than 17 million passengers to 30 million by approximately 2018. New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside and including further terminal capacity, will clearly be needed to cater for this growth. The issue at this point is how best to provide that additional capacity to meet passenger growth.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at the airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. A report in 2003 by a panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey assessed the independent terminal concept taking account of 13 &ldquo;expressions of interest&rdquo; submitted to my Department on the development of an independent, competing terminal at Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>I recognise that an early decision is desirable in respect of this matter so that, regardless of how it is provided, adequate terminal capacity will be in place at Dublin Airport when required to meet the growth in passenger traffic. I am in the process of finalising proposals which I will bring to Government shortly. My objective in putting proposals to Government will be to ensure the provision and operation of terminal capacity on an efficient and cost-effective basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept the Government&rsquo;s treatment of Aer Lingus is inexcusable at this stage? It was the injudicious remarks of the Minister for State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, when he said there was no urgency for a decision, which precipitated the loss of the senior management at Aer Lingus and which now means that effectively very few options remain open for the restructuring and refinancing of the company. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, promised a decision before Christmas. At Christmas he promised there would definitely be one before January, and still there is no decision.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that recently at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, the lame duck chairman of Aer Lingus said the company must have a decision on financing early in the first half of this year. Is that decision going to be made by the Government and when is it going to be made? Negotiations with Airbus and Boeing have dragged on. The critical moment approaches when an order must be placed. Where is the money to come from? Aer Lingus is being greatly disadvantaged as a result of the way it is being treated by Government and decisions must be made. I believe the Minister accepts that, but why are they not being made? What are the barriers in the way of making a decision? Is there tension within Cabinet or what is going on? Is the <Col N="1213"/>Taoiseach afraid to upset someone? Why has no decision been made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-driving this agenda forward. I said I would bring the matter to Government before Christmas. I did and told the Deputy and others afterwards that because of the Sustaining Progress arrangements, I would immediately engage with the stakeholders involved in the national wage agreement and with the ICTU in particular. I have done that. There has been considerable engagement, both at my level and between officials. The ICTU has its own experts reviewing the financial situation. I have told the Deputy that I expect that process to be completed shortly. I want to go to Government on the issue of Aer Lingus and to conclude it quickly. However, I want to do it by way of partnership involving the sharing of information and knowledge so that no stakeholder involved in the process feels excluded from knowing the basis on which a decision is being made.</P>
        <P>As regards the terminal, I am happy to inform the Deputy and the House that there has been excellent engagement on this issue both at my level and through officials over recent weeks and months. I fully accept, as does the Government, that clarity and decision needs to be made immediately on the terminal issue. The numbers clearly indicate we must have a second terminal at Dublin Airport. I want to see that decision and I expect to go to Government shortly with my proposals. We are coming to a conclusion on the matter with all the stakeholders.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1215"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>To some extent the Minister has answered my question, but not quite all of it. Does he agree that numbers are growing at an alarming rate at Dublin Airport? In 2004, 17.4 million passengers went through the airport, an increase of 8% on the previous year and 350% on 1990 when the figure was approximately five million. Dublin has one of the fastest growing airports in Europe. There are two solutions. I am glad that the Minister agrees a second terminal is needed while indicating it may be coming on stream shortly.</P>
        <P>Has the Government considered opening the airport at Baldonnel to commercial or passenger traffic. That would take much of the pressure off the north side of County Dublin. It is adjacent to the M50 motorway and it would make sense. Rather than channelling 17.5 million passengers through north County Dublin every year, it would make much sense to consider opening Baldonnel to commercial traffic.</P>
        <P>If a second terminal is opened at Dublin Airport, will it be an independently owned airport or a mixture of State and private ownership?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy has said, the numbers are growing massively. That is a mark of the economy&rsquo;s success in terms of trade and tourism. I have not considered the issue of Baldonnel at this stage. My focus has exclusively been on expanding capacity at Dublin Airport by providing a second terminal. I believe, as does the Government, that it is vital for future economic development. Whatever happens with other airports will be a matter for consideration later. I am not considering that issue at the moment, rather I am specifically considering&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister ruling out Baldonnel?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must not be interrupted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not considered it at this stage. I am focused entirely on the issue of providing the second terminal. I hope to be in a position to go to Government shortly to sign off on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the terminal, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, announced that a decision would be made on the second terminal. The Minister mentioned the possibility of a competing terminal. Is it possible, given the present structure of the Dublin Airport Authority which provides not only a terminal but also other services, to have real competition where another terminal competes with the existing one which also provides these shared services? Is it not leaving one of them in a dominant position? Is it possible to have that type of competition arrangement and has the hiving off of the terminal from the Dublin Airport Authority been considered?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1216"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy raises an important question. Clearly, it is an important issue to be considered in the context of the infrastructure at Dublin Airport and how an airport functions. From the point of view of the passengers and the 90 airlines using the airport, we want the most competitive and cost-efficient terminals, including the existing one. That forms part of the consideration on how we ensure that.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 91 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to develop a metro for Dublin with a link to Dublin Airport. The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department a detailed business case for a metro from the city centre to Dublin Airport while Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted proposals last July for an integrated rail network in the greater Dublin area. These proposals include the electrification of the Kildare, northern and Maynooth lines, a DART service to the airport off the northern line and an interconnector tunnel linking Heuston Station to the docklands to enable greater integration of rail services.</P>
        <P>I expect to put proposals to Government in the near future for a ten year transport investment framework in the light of the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of agreement in principle to a ten year capital investment envelope for transport. This plan will set out a comprehensive investment strategy for the greater Dublin area within the policy framework established by the document published by the Dublin Transportation Office, entitled A Platform for Change, and will take account of the proposals referred to above.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not looking for a history lesson. We all know what proposals are there. I asked for the Minister&rsquo;s thinking on the proposal. What does he believe is the best way of serving the northside and the airport in particular? Does the Minister accept that the northside has lost out badly in transport infrastructure, in spite of hav<Col N="1217"/>ing a northside Taoiseach? Will the Minister give priority to serving the northside and Dublin Airport? What is his current thinking on the alternative proposals? On the one hand, there is the prospect of having a metro to the airport, serving Ballymun <i>en route</i>. On the other hand, there is a proposal by Irish Rail to take a spur off the DART line. When is the Minister likely to bring firm proposals to the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy. There is no doubt that north Dublin is in serious need of a transport solution. I dislike the way it is often presented as an airport solution, because that is not the full capacity of what we should be delivering. There is the issue of the population base and the location of the metro, as well as the opening of further land for housing development. We need a transport solution for north Dublin.</P>
        <P>This ten year envelope changes the perspective that I can bring to transport solutions for Dublin and the rest of the country. That is why the Minister for Finance announced this in his budget speech. The issues outlined in my response and those raised by the Deputy are on the desk. I want to make sure we pick the best of everything, but not in isolation. There has to be connectivity between all of the elements. We have to look at the connectivity between central Dublin, its suburbs and surrounding towns like Kildare, Maynooth and Drogheda. The different solutions, such as the metro, the interconnector and electrification of the lines, are all on the table.</P>

	<P>If Deputy Ryan was in charge, they would be sitting there for the rest of his life. I want to conclude this. Since the budget speech, we have been involved in putting these solutions on the table. I also want to have real costings.</P>

	<P>I expect to go to the Cabinet sub-committee on this issue next month.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The former Minister with responsibility for public transport, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke, promised us a metro seven years ago. She abandoned a Luas line for the northside in favour of an all-singing, all-dancing metro, saying we would all be riding on it within seven years. We have now lost seven years of planning, while costs have escalated and traffic has got worse. The current Minister is telling us that it is all on the table. The Government went to the electorate with A Platform for Change, which was a lovely map of everything that was going to be built in Dublin. We still have no evidence that any of it is anything other than a figment of the imagination. The Taoiseach stated two weeks ago that the metro was not going to happen as it was too costly. What has happened in the last couple of weeks that the Minister&rsquo;s trusty lieutenant was able to announce yesterday that the metro was going to go ahead? Will it happen? Has a decision been made? If a metro is not to be developed, then what will be developed? We have lost seven years of planning. We have already spent &euro;8 million on establishing the feasibility of a metro. Is it feasible? The Taoiseach stated that it was not. Could we spend the same money building five Luas lines? When will we get a decision? We have had decisions in the past. Do they mean anything when this Minister makes them? Can he give us a timeframe for when this will be built if the decision is to be made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The timeframe will be short. The ten year envelope was only announced in the budget speech in December. I have been involved in intensive preparation and I intend to go to Government at the first available meeting in March to put all these proposals before it. That is a reasonably short timeframe in respect of my tenure in office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not all start when this Minister assumed office. It started seven years ago when the promise was made on a metro. Where is it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy wants me to answer the question, then I will do so. Does the proposal of the development of the metro and the many other proposals present solutions for north Dublin? The answer is that they do. However, I want to get the best solution, which is that which marries all of the different proposals together. We do not want to cherry-pick the sexy metro as a solution to everything. There are issues relating to interconnectivity with Dublin, for the DART and the lines from Maynooth, Kildare, Drogheda <Col N="1219"/>and so on. There are issues relating to capacity on the existing lines and stations. When I announce these proposals on behalf of the Government, I will face Opposition Deputies who will ask these questions. I want to make sure that my proposals can be delivered and are not idealistic.</P>
        <P>I accept what the Deputy said about my Minister of State. I am blessed to have such an enthusiastic Minister of State. His commitment sometimes overruns with enthusiasm. Some of his recent pronouncements to the Fourth Estate are just guess work and are not based on any fact. I am sure he will join with me in supporting our proposals enthusiastically when they are made public.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Did he steal the Minister&rsquo;s thunder? We look forward to an early decision. The Minister is answering for his two predecessors who dragged their heels on transport initiatives in the Dublin area. What is the status of the commitment in the programme for Government to provide a full metro serving the airport? The Minister seems to be indicating he is still considering the possibility of a metro. The Taoiseach has stated that it is out of the question. Where does the overall plan for the metro now stand?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a key question. I do not claim to be an expert on public transport. However, some of the issues are clear. If one is to provide the best in terms of maximum capacity on a daily basis, then that presents one obvious solution. If one opts for different solutions, one provides different loading capacities, different levels of capacity and different usages.</P>
        <P>As I acknowledged at the outset, the Deputy is correct to state that north Dublin has a clear need for significant investment in a transit system. I have publicly stated as much and there is no question about it. It is ironic that the Taoiseach who is from north Dublin has been so generous to the people of south Dublin in terms of the transport solutions which have been provided there. As I tried to explain to the Deputy, it was wrong to present a solution for north Dublin merely as an airport link. Deputies Shortall and Olivia Mitchell have often raised with me issues of spatial planning, capacity, the opening of new land in north Dublin for good quality, good value housing and the need to connect existing residential areas on the northside. One must examine the cost of making such provisions without distorting one&rsquo;s investments in other areas of Dublin and the rest of the country. Many Deputies raise with me the question of the western rail corridor. My aim in the ten-year envelope is to balance all of these competing needs. Clearly, everybody&rsquo;s wish list cannot be fulfilled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister saying the metro is dead?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1220"/>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am saying no such thing until I go to Government early in March to address the Cabinet sub-committee. I will bring proposals to Government which will be considered and, subsequently, made public.</P>
        <P>The ten-year envelope changes the way we can deliver all infrastructure. One can provide for a great deal of parallel development. Where necessary, one can go straight to the planning, tender, design or construction stage. One can set a number of projects in train at the same time though they will be completed at different times. Having to wait until one project is completed before starting the next has prevented us from providing the level of infrastructure required. The new procedures change the basis on which we can move forward in public and road transport provision with a mixture of investment from the State and private sector.</P>

        <Quest>the role his Department will play in the possible planning of new orbital motorways around Dublin; the work which has been done to set out the design, cost and possible timescale for the building of such roads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[5090/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to the concept of a Dublin outer orbital route. Strategic Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area 1999 and the Dublin Transportation Office document, Platform for Change 2000, identified a possible need for a Dublin outer orbital route to link Drogheda, Navan and Naas. More recently, Regional Planning Guidelines for the Greater Dublin Area 2004 made provision for the development of such a route in the medium to long term on the basis that the centres in question would be strengthened by the provision of decent links which do not pass through the Dublin city area.</P>
        <P>A 2001 strategic study commissioned by the NRA concluded that a Dublin outer orbital route had significant merit and was feasible on engineering and environmental grounds. Apart from identifying a possible corridor for an outer orbital, the 2001 report did not consider route options, appropriate road type and costs as it constituted simply a high-level strategic study of the concept. Detailed consideration of these and other issues, including spatial planning, land use, environmental impact and the appropriate type and class of road to be provided, will be the subject of further studies.</P>
        <P>I have asked the NRA to carry out these further studies and consider the proposed route as part of future road infrastructure development plans. The NRA will take into account in its deliberations the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines and the planning and traffic implications of the route for greater Dublin and neighbouring regions. The proposal will also be considered in the context of the ten-<Col N="1221"/>year transport investment framework being prepared within my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>History tells us that if we ask the NRA whether it is a good idea to build a road, it will inevitably say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. As it is a road building agency, its function is to build roads. The Minister&rsquo;s Department should plan transport in this city. I contend we have no planning of a proper transport system for the city as evidenced by the fact that much as one might think of the southside as the land of milk and honey, it does not work because the road system the Government has put in place does not function. I do not want to know what the NRA&rsquo;s answer to a question would be because I know what it would say. I want to know when the Minister&rsquo;s Department will begin to provide joined-up thinking in transport and make a decision as to whether public transport or yet more roads will provide a solution which works.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the plan to widen the M50 to an eight-lane highway will not work, as the Taoiseach acknowledges? Road building cannot solve the transport problems of this city as traffic merely increases as the capacity of a road expands. When will we learn that lesson and begin to invest in public transport instead of roads? When will we stop allowing the National Roads Authority to set the country&rsquo;s transport policy?</P>

	<P>What happens to the ten-year fairytale if the Government is not re-elected, something to which we all look forward? What possible validity can a ten-year plan have when it requires the <i>imprimatur</i> of the people to decide who will be in Government in ten years time? Does the Minister believe there is a need for a greater Dublin transport and planning authority to implement the joined-up thinking to which he referred but which the Government has never addressed?</P>
        <P>The Minister said that before he could present a project to Cabinet, he had to ensure it was robust and would work. Why is he, his Department and the NRA presenting a project to widen the M50 which the NRA and everyone else acknowledges will not work? Why does the Minister contend that public transport projects cannot be presented until every detail has been examined while it is full steam ahead in the area of roads which are prioritised in every instance whether or not they are expected to work? It does not seem to matter that traffic modelling demonstrates there will be absolute chaos on the M50. The solution is another orbital road while the regional planning guidelines refer to a further orbital road beyond that one. When will the Government reject road building solutions and begin to fund public transport? It should be this year rather than in ten years time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 95, 132, 157, 171, 344, 354 and 360 together.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted a business case to my Department for the development of a greater Dublin integrated rail network, the aim of which is to meet the projected demand for rail services in the area into the future. The business case includes proposals to construct a new rail station in the city centre, provide an interconnector tunnel linking Heuston to the docklands, provide a spur off the Maynooth line to the N3 beyond Dunboyne and expand the capacity of the DART.</P>
        <P>My Department is assessing the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann proposed integrated rail network plan and I expect to respond to the company in the context of the ten year transport investment framework being finalised in my Department at present. In the meantime, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has undertaken preparatory work on some of the projects in the integrated plan.</P>
        <P>Phase 2 of the DART upgrade project, to commence later this year and be completed by 2007, involves an upgrade of signalling in the city centre that will result in additional train paths across the loop line bridge and help alleviate existing congestion.</P>
        <P>The company in consultation with Meath and Fingal County Councils has just completed a <Col N="1225"/>feasibility study into the possibility of providing a spur off the Maynooth line at Clonsilla to a point off the N3 beyond Dunboyne. While there are no plans at present to extend this line to Navan, the provision of a park and ride site near the N3 to cater for Navan traffic is being considered. It is now a matter in the next instance for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to decide how it wishes to proceed with this proposal.</P>
        <P>The current technical constraints at Connolly Station mean it is essential that a new station is built in the city centre before the proposed Dunboyne spur is operational or before the additional city centre capacity required for Maynooth and Sligo services can be provided. While the Maynooth service has improved significantly in recent years, following the dualling of the track and the introduction of new rolling stock, projected future demand can only be met by provision of this new station, which would alleviate the current technical constraints and enable increased capacity to be provided.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is examining suitable sites for locating the new station. I have provided &euro;5 million this year for this project and expect a report on progress shortly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>When will there be a decision with regard to the new station at Spencer Dock, which determines the speed of delivery? There is a question mark about whether it will go over or under ground. Can we expect an expedient decision on the matter? It would have a greater effect, especially on the Dunboyne Navan link.</P>
        <P>The Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann study has shown it is viable to open the line to Dunboyne and beyond. Will funding be provided to carry out these works parallel to works in Dublin, so that when Dublin is sorted out the line will be ready to start operating from Meath?</P>
        <P>Will the Department fund a feasibility study &mdash; similar to that carried out with regard to Dunboyne &mdash; into extending the line the rest of the way to Navan? We were told a year or two ago the Dunboyne line would not work. It is now part of the plan and on the agenda. It can be done. This is after a report was completed and a study undertaken, driven at council level then through the Department and on to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. We were proven right in that we have a case for a railway line to Meath. No doubt, the same case will be proven with regard to Navan if the feasibility study is carried out and it is given a chance. It is wrong to banish the link to Navan without proper study and say it is not to be done because it is not on the agenda.</P>
        <P>Navan and areas beyond must be serviced by rail. Navan is part of the greater Dublin region. The Department&rsquo;s spatial strategy states that the success of the greater Dublin region is based on rail. Navan is not mentioned as a hub or a gateway, but linked to Dublin. It is wrong not to provide a rail link and goes against common sense with regard to Government policy. The Government&rsquo;s spatial strategy states we should do it.</P><Col N="1226"/>
        <P>We should at least provide a few hundred thousand euros to complete the study with regard to the rest of the way from the N3 to Navan. Navan will serve north Meath, Kells, Cavan and beyond. A railway line is badly needed to reduce congestion. It will be proved viable. The Department should examine the matter and guarantee funding for the line to be built to Dunboyne. It should make a quick decision regarding the Spencer Dock development. It should certainly speed up matters with regard to Navan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect to hear of progress regarding decisions on the work done by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann regarding feasibility. I have already provided substantial funding for the station. We all agree that we urgently need the station in Dublin. Deputy Olivia Mitchell has spoken on the issue several times. I hope Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will come to a conclusion on the sites it is currently considering.</P>
        <P>With regard to the line from Clonsilla to Dunboyne, I am pleased that both Meath and Fingal local authorities are working with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the issue. They do not have plans at present, but I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point. Navan is an important area and there is no doubt there will be continued growth there. Continued investment in connectivity into Dublin from Navan will probably be required. However, we must start somewhere. We are currently looking at the Dunboyne route being agreed. Clearly there is a logic to follow on from that. I do not deny that, but all things are not immediately possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We accept the line must be built in a phased way. Money could at least be provided and we should encourage completion of the study with regard to extending the link the rest of the way to Navan. It will make the entire line more economically viable. The least we could do is to agree to study the matter and have it ready, so that it can be built when funding becomes available. We do not expect it tomorrow. The feasibility study could be completed. It proved successful with regard to the Cork-Midleton line. Such studies are worth doing. It is not fair to banish the chance of a railway line to Navan without proper homework to prove the case one way or another. That is what happened with the rail review of 2003. It was put to one side on the basis of false figures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s perspective; it is reasonable. When I get the report in progress, I will consider the Dunboyne issue. I will query the next step and ask whether there is any thinking beyond that and whether they will proceed with further feasibility studies on connectivity to Navan. It is a reasonable question, although I cannot promise an instant solution. However, it is a logical consequence if we proceed with the Dunboyne route.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1227"/>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the concept of the extension to the docklands or Spencer Dock, wherever it may be. I hope there will be an early decision, as so many other issues hinge on it. I also support the notion of an interconnector from that station out to Heuston. However, what is the Minister&rsquo;s opinion on the priority that might be given to the interconnector considering it is largely concerned with the important issue of interconnecting and integrating this system? It is mainly about facilitating people who are already off the road, out of cars and into public transport. They travel in from Maynooth or some other direction on a train. In terms of taking cars off the streets of Dublin, their contribution might not be as great as a metro or several Luas lines.</P>
        <P>Given that we are spending &euro;1 billion on a port tunnel to clear the quays, is there a great deal of sense making it our priority to build a tunnel under the quays? Are there other possible solutions that the quays might now present to meet that need? I am only looking for an opinion, not the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is bang on the money in every sense. That is one of the issues with which I am grappling. I have been asking similar questions in recent weeks to try to establish what exactly should be included. Where does one get best value? I do not just mean best value in terms of money, but also in terms of modal shift and getting people out of cars. The interconnector will encourage a further substantial modal shift because it will be possible to bring the trains directly into the centre of Dublin. That is a completely different concept to where we are at currently. That is why the new train station in the city centre is crucial to a whole range of issues, which cannot work without that station being in place.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The interconnector is a good idea and I see what it does. It also adds a route from Heuston, which will not be a direct line. One must do it in a manner that loops and creates further access and egress at different points along the route in and around the city. It adds another dimension to traffic in and around Dublin. It is a very good proposal, although that is all I am prepared to say at this stage. Unfortunately, I have many good proposals from many different sources. However, some are becoming more clear than others in terms of what they can do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Minister give an indication of his priority? Is he giving an undertaking that the northside will receive priority? Within days of his appointment, the Minister talked about joining up the two Luas lines. That is off the top of the head stuff and not helpful in the area of transport. The problem over the years is that there has not been joined up thinking.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister confirm that the north side of Dublin will receive his priority attention in the implementation of the ten year plan? That is criti<Col N="1228"/>cal. I accept that the interconnector is required and that it is a good proposal. However, it will predominantly assist the south side of the city. Will the Minister give an undertaking that he will deal with the problem of providing a major rail link to the north side of the city before dealing with the other projects in the pipeline?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question that there is a glaring deficit in north Dublin and it must be tackled immediately. There is no prevarication on my part on that issue. However, I am in a stronger position than having to concentrate only on that matter. The ten year envelope changes dramatically what I can recommend to the Government and what we can decide to do. We are focusing on Dublin in this debate but there are other huge issues with regard to the west and the midlands as well as Dublin. They are three big sections and each of them requires equal consideration.</P>
        <P>However, the Deputy hit the nail on the head in referring to the interconnector. The issue I am trying to resolve is the connectivity of public transport. I referred to connecting the two Luas lines but what I was trying to illustrate was taken badly out of context. We can have interconnectors or metros and the existing or even expanded Luas lines as well as expanded bus corridors but the paying passenger must be able comfortably to use one mode of transport and switch to another mode. The question is whether it is easy, after getting off one mode of transport, to get on to the other mode of transport to travel somewhere else.</P>
        <P>That type of connectivity is crucial. Regardless of whether one is talking about metros, interconnectors, the Luas, the DART or mainline rail services, all of them must be such that the user of public transport can be confident that wherever they embark on whatever mode of public transport he or she wishes to use, on leaving that mode of transport the passenger who wishes to travel from point B to point C can move to another mode of transport in a seamless way. If one travels into the city on the DART or by mainline rail, for example, one should be able to hop on the Luas or, if travelling to north Dublin, hop on to whatever service will be provided there. That is the challenge. One can continue to provide these services but I am anxious to get the best from all the proposals and much more than just the A to B element of them. I must ensure that the connectivity works and that it is seen to work by the public. However, I agree that north Dublin has a clear need.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister says he has no plans to extend the rail line to Navan. What will it take to change his mind and to start planning for a rail line to Navan? Has he not considered changing his plans in view of the recent EIS on the widening of the M50? It showed that the M50 will not work even if its width is doubled. Regardless of what super highway is provided, there will <Col N="1229"/>be gridlock at the junctions with roads from Navan. Did that not encourage the Minister to change his plans and consider the alternative of providing a rail line which does not get stuck at the M50?</P>
        <P>If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government decided it was not a clever idea to run a motorway through an area of such important archeological and historical interest as the Tara-Skryne valley and decided not to proceed with the project, would that prompt the Minister for Transport to question and change his current plans and consider planning a rail link to Navan? That would provide the connectivity in public transport solutions to which the Minister refers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is willing to come forward with plans if there is a market and a need for&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister have plans for a line?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister provide the funding?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the expansion of that line. I was open in giving my views to the Deputy earlier. I will raise the matter and I have no problem with that. The Deputy made a reasonable point earlier and I will come back to him about it on my next Question Time. I will try to expand on that point and see what the precise position is.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion that the expansion and widening of the M50 will achieve nothing. That is not the case. The Deputy forgets that people in this country, like people in other countries, choose the car as their primary mode of transport regardless of whether we like it. There has been huge growth in car usage in Ireland but Ireland is still below the EU average in terms of car ownership. One can only presume, therefore, that the number of cars on our roads will continue to grow.</P>
        <P>We are trying to do two things. We are trying to create massive improvement in public transport, which the taxpayer has been funding for the past five or six years, and at the same time provide massive improvement in road infrastructure. The difficulty is that neither can be done overnight. There is a lead-in time and a number of years will pass before all the elements are in place to resolve the issues. That is a simple fact. Neither I nor anybody in any other country has encountered a solution whereby one can parachute something in overnight and solve the problems.</P>
        <P>The taxpayer has been funding the huge investment in public transport and road infrastructure and will continue to do so for at least another ten to 15 years. Recognising that challenge, the Government has provided, for the first time in <Col N="1230"/>the history of the State, a ten year envelope to do that work.</P>

	<P>People in this country do not choose public transport because the public transport options are not available to them due to the failure of this and previous Governments to provide them. With regard to setting out plans, the Minister said earlier that he had asked the NRA to consider plans for a new orbital motorway. Why does he not tell Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that he, as the public policy maker, wishes to provide public transport options and ask that body to bring forward a detailed plan of how that would work? Why does the Minister not take a lead and, rather than throwing his hands up in the air and saying people like their cars and that he can do nothing about it, start providing the public transport people desperately want?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Connectivity is a good policy. One of the areas on which the Minister was in dispute with Ivor the terrible when he was first appointed to office was the Luas connection and the possibility of connecting the two lines. The Luas lines have been wildly successful beyond everybody&rsquo;s dreams. They are popular with the public and have been successful in taking cars off the road. They would be even more successful if they were connected. What is the position with the connection? Has the Minister asked the RPA to examine ways of connecting the lines that do not involve going through Trinity College and the like? There are other possibilities and suggestions for connecting the two lines. Has progress been made in selecting a route? A connection would make a big difference, even if it is mainly on the south side of the city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister proceeds with the interconnector, I take it he will not come up with a separate solution for joining the two Luas lines. The interconnector connects those lines. I hope the Minister will not duplicate it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is heavy rail and I am not sure that is the solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister mentioned the increase in the rate of car ownership and said these projects cannot be carried out overnight. However, what could be done overnight to greatly improve the traffic situation is increase the number of buses. Despite the undertaking given in the national development plan, why has not one additional bus been provided for Dublin Bus since 2000? It beggars belief that the Minister would allow that to happen. The local authorities are providing extra bus lanes and reducing the amount of space on the roads for drivers. That is a good approach but it is pointless unless the extra buses are provided.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus cannot meet the demand that exists because it does not have enough buses. This particularly applies to the commuter belt in <Col N="1231"/>Meath, Kildare and Wicklow. There are growing population centres in those counties and there is huge demand for public transport. Residents are meeting public representatives and representatives of Dublin Bus to ask for new services but Dublin Bus is obliged to explain that it cannot provide new services because it does not have the buses. The Government promised 275 buses under the national development plan but only 93 have been provided. Why is that? Why can the Minister not sanction the provision of these buses, which could be on the streets in a matter of months?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the three issues, Deputy Eamon Ryan and I clearly have a different view of the world. We will just have to leave it at that. The only one throwing his hands in the air in the House today, that I can see, is Deputy Eamon Ryan.</P>
        <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell asked me about connecting the two Luas lines. I believe both lines should be connected. I have stated that publicly and I have asked the Railway Procurement Agency to examine the matter. I do not know where the notion arose that the link line would have to go through Trinity College.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was somebody&rsquo;s suggestion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It amazes me that when one makes a reasonably sound statement, somebody hijacks it and talks about Trinity College almost being knocked down to accommodate the Luas line. It was never a suggestion of mine and it has no basis in fact.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness, I know that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nonsense. I do not know where it came from but I can guess. I presume it was stirred up by those not far behind Deputy Olivia Mitchell.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Public relations consultants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Eamon Ryan would know a lot about that all right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>So would the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would and I can stand over everything I have ever done.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s comment with regard to connecting the Luas lines is true up to a point but not entirely so. It depends on how one routes the lines, as well as the stops along the way. The Deputy&rsquo;s point is fair but it does not necessarily mean that one excludes the other; it depends on how one does them. That matter is currently on the table. In terms of operational good sense and capitalising on the success of the Luas, as a point of principle, it would be good for both lines to be interconnected. It would be good for the integration of public transport in Dublin.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Deputy about buses. In recent years, the State has provided major investment in CIE for replacement purposes. I do not have the figures in front of me but we have provided approximately &euro;400 million or &euro;500 million.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the point the Deputy is making and I will come to it but I just wanted to place on the record what we have done. As regards the Deputy&rsquo;s point with regard to CIE, of course I want to continue to invest in CIE and I will do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister not keep the promises he made?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hang on. Of course, I want to provide new buses for CIE and I will do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has not done so and is not doing so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but I also want to examine how Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s operations are run in order to get the maximum value for them as efficient, well-run companies. This concerns how they organise all their current assets. My view is that they can do much more with what they have.</P>
        <P>The second point is that private investment in bus operations around the country has been phenomenal in recent years. There has been a huge investment in such transport capacity. I have met with the social partners &mdash; the unions and company management &mdash; and we have all agreed that the Dublin market needs to be opened up. The trade unions have agreed with that also. We now want to bring to a conclusion what exactly that means. I have views, as do the trade unions and company management, and we are not that far apart.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Cullen is the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, exactly, but I want to be fair and give them the opportunity to make their points. I agree with both Deputies in this regard &mdash; I want to see greater capacity for buses operating in Dublin because that could make a further substantial contribution to public transport.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my predecessor jointly determined in late 2003 to consider the engagement of operators from the private sector in the operation of speed cameras. This consideration responds to a provision in the Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 &mdash; a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library &mdash; that the number of speed checks annually should be 11.1 million and this speed enforcement target could be achieved through the deployment of additional enforcement assets through the engagement of private sector camera operations.</P>
        <P>The engagement of the private sector in the operation of speed cameras would have to be supported by new road traffic primary legislation. A working group representing our Departments and other relevant agencies is examining a range of issues, including the parameters for operation and deployment of speed cameras and the interaction of any private sector operation with other agencies. I understand the working group is due to report shortly. This will allow my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and myself, to consider all the implications that arise concerning this issue. When we have completed that process, we will consider presenting the matter to Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

	<P>The great survivor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Prior to the European Parliament elections in 1979, I recall that the late and much loved Se&aacute;n Flanagan, from my county, announced a £500 million package to save the west. When the truth was discovered, however, the election was over. I notice that at a recent Fianna F&aacute;il meeting, the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, seems to have got a rush of Valentine&rsquo;s blood to the head. He announced a package of &euro;16 billion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;over ten years for transport. The package included a metro line from Dublin city centre to the airport, running underground to Dublin&rsquo;s northside; a second terminal at the airport; an investment in road construction of over &euro;1 billion per year; the reopening of rail services to County Meath at a cost of &euro;156 million; a new rail station at Spencer Dock; and an underground rail interconnector linking Heuston and Connolly railway stations at a cost of &euro;1 billion. What struck me was that at the end of Deputy Callely&rsquo;s contribution, as reported in the newspapers, he said he did not want to pre-empt any decision of the Minister in having this matter brought before the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>He left the loose change in the kitty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Later in his remarks, Deputy Callely said he had ordered reconstruction works to commence at the exit from the Dublin port tunnel that will spit out 6,000 trucks per day. He also said: &ldquo;You will see a visible improvement in this shortly.&rdquo; Will the Taoiseach comment on the Minister of State&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day message? Does the Taoiseach agree with this kind of carry on? Did he hear the Minister, Deputy Cullen, say a short time ago that the figures released by Deputy Callely &ldquo;are just guess work and are not based on any fact&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>We now have a Minister for traffic, appointed by the Government, yet he is making remarks that are not based on facts, merely on guess work. <Col N="1235"/>Everybody knows that travel times have increased dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The average car journey time is now very much more than it was. Arising from that, does the Taoiseach agree with Deputy Callely&rsquo;s carry on? Will the Taoiseach clarify the position in so far as the metro is concerned? Is there any basis in fact for this &euro;16 billion, ten-year programme that has been announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Kenny knows, the Minister dealt with all these questions earlier today. The Government is in the final stages of preparing the ten-year plan which was agreed in the budget. We said we would extend the envelope to a ten-year programme and would examine transport projects in all areas. That brings into play what the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, was referring to &mdash; all the current proposals that have been presented in one form or another. The Government is committed to delivering a 21st century transport infrastructure. There is an unparalleled commitment to the transport sector, including &euro;2.1 billion in Exchequer support this year alone. Obviously, the figure for the ten-year period will be enormous. However, all these matters are under discussion at the Cabinet sub-committee. It is hoped they will be finalised in March and then the Minister will formally present them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for the clarity he has brought to this matter. I have known for years that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is not shy, particularly at Christmas, but I saw his photograph some time ago in the newspaper and he looked like Napoleon in a hard hat when the giant underground cutter broke through at the port tunnel. He proclaimed victory on behalf of the people of Dublin as he single-handedly achieved this wonderful breakthrough. Given that he will be known as the Minster for fantasy in terms of transport, does the Taoiseach propose to speak to him about such wild announcements which are based on guess work? Despite all the remarks he made, he never referred to outside greater Dublin.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on his views regarding an outer relief road for Dublin, which has been mooted for many years? Is there room in these proposals for any other part of the country? For instance, the former Minister for Transport, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, who was equally good at making announcements, stated it would cost &euro;300 million to reopen the western rail corridor between Sligo and Ennis. Will that ever appear at the Cabinet table? What about the south east, south and south west which have not been mentioned by the Minister for fantasy?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1236"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures sound enormous but the five-year plan will cost &euro;10.2 billion. The budget for infrastructure this year alone is more than &euro;2 billion. The levels of expenditure on public transport and the roads programme are enormous.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s important question on the regions, in recent years an unprecedented number of major high quality road projects have been completed. Under the ten-year plan, all the regions will get a fair share of the resources. The final plan must be drawn up but the intention is to build on what has been done in recent years at Port Laoise, Balbriggan, Cavan, Arklow, Donegal, Callan, Nenagh, Blackpool, Croom, Kilmacthomas, Kildare, Watergrasshill, Drogheda, Youghal, Skibbereen, Monasterevin, Ashford, Rathnew, Ballincollig, Cork and Limerick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Mallow northern relief road should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The latest on the south east is that a previously unknown, unheard of and undocumented historical site has emerged in the area but it is hoped that will be resolved. Deputy Howlin will help us to do that. The regions will get a fair share and a plan will be announced next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Just when we had grown accustomed to getting Christmas cards from the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, we will have to prepare for Valentine&rsquo;s cards as well. I am not sure the system will be able to cope with that.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline to the House honestly whether he has any regrets about appointing the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, as Minister for Health and Children? She came into the House on 18 November 2004 and promised to provide 200,000 &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; medical cards and 30,000 ordinary medical cards. The doctors welcomed this, as one would expect, but there were no more discussions with them. The cards could not be provided and the T&aacute;naiste then found it necessary to bring in legislation, which was promised within a few weeks but has not appeared. None of that explains where are the 30,000 ordinary medical cards which were to take effect from 1 January. What has happened to them?</P>
      <P>I refer to the figures of the GMS payments board, which show that more than 8,000 people, comprising 6,296 in January and 2,068 in December, have lost their medical cards. A total of 64,478 people have lost medical cards since before the general election. In case the Taoiseach says it is because they have received great wage increases, I remind him that the threshold for a single person living alone is &euro;153 a week while it is &euro;284.40 for a married couple with two children. This is after the 7.5% increase in the thresholds from 1 January 2005. Did the Minister for Health and Children miscalculate? Did she think that the <Col N="1237"/>simple application of the 7.5% increase would result in 30,000 additional medical cards?</P>
      <P>More than 8,000 fewer people have medical cards than were promised. How much more will we accept? People in pain and suffering on paltry incomes are not able to get a medical card and more than 8,000 have lost theirs in the past two months alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>At the beginning of the year, 1,145, 083 people were covered by medical cards, which is just short of 29% of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>It used to be 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct. The health boards continued last year with their management review of the medical card database, which has been a factor in reducing the number of medical cards. The T&aacute;naiste made that clear in the House recently. This exercise last year removed approximately 104,000 cards from the medical register for various reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BreedaMoynihanCronin"><NameTxt>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</NameTxt>
	<P>What reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is taking steps to ensure people on low incomes can visit their general practitioner and bring their children without being put off by cost.</P>
      <P>We expect 230,000 more people to benefit this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>When?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of 30,000 will receive the traditional medical card and 200,000 will get the doctor visit cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>They are being short-changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A short Bill is needed, which must be passed in the House shortly. The T&aacute;naiste hopes all the cards will be circulated before the end of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is such a short Bill, why is it taking such a long time to emerge? It has nothing to do with the provision of 30,000 traditional medical cards. What is the point in repeating statistics? More than 8,000 fewer people have medical cards and there is no sign of the T&aacute;naiste changing that.</P>
      <P>How can the Taoiseach say this Minister is performing? She lost the chief executive of the Health Service Executive and she has presided over the robbing of people in nursing homes. She was not present last night when 1,500 people attended a protest demonstration about the condition of Wexford General Hospital nor was she present last week when 795 people met under the disability banner to protest at the useless nature of the Disability Bill. Her predecessor, Deputy Martin, may have done nothing except commission consultancy reports but she is going backwards. No chief executive has been appointed, no <Col N="1238"/>&ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; medical cards have emerged while 30,000 medical cards that were promised have not been delivered and cards have been taken from more than 8,000 people.</P>
      <P>The accident and emergency service is in crisis but the Minister did not forget to increase the charge for this service by &euro;10 or increase the drugs refund threshold or increase bed charges by &euro;10 from 1 January but she forgot to deliver medical cards, negotiate with the doctors and to prevent the loss of the chief executive of the health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

Naas hospital is doing very well as the Deputy knows. His colleague, former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, put that in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Stagg should know this is his leader&rsquo;s question and he is not entitled to ask a supplementary question or to comment. The Taoiseach, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He was not interrupting. He just wanted to congratulate the Government on Naas hospital. There are also all of the other <Col N="1239"/>developments. In the accident and emergency area this year we have a planned programme to put almost &euro;70 million into improving those accident and emergency areas that are deficient. We have also put significant additional staff into these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about his prodigal Minister, sitting beside him, the Minister for Transport, particularly in the context of the EU Commission report today about Irish women being at greatest risk of poverty in the European Union compared to other member states. It is important to examine how we use public money. Has the Taoiseach anything to say with regard to the loss of public money such as money lost on electronic voting machines, &euro;52 million, and storage of &euro;680,000 per annum, rising to &euro;1 million if we include maintenance, for machines which it seems will never be used? I raised the issue of the escalating costs for the upgrade of the M50 previously. Over a few months the costs have risen from approximately &euro;200 million to &euro;800 million, an enormous increase. Also, should a PR consultant effectively charging twice as much as a rival PR consultancy company be hired? On the issue of public money &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is entitled to ask a question on one topical issue only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is all about one topic, public money. The Ceann Comhairle knows well that asking about the Minister who oversees that spending is asking on one topic. How can the Taoiseach say that the Minister is exonerated when Mr. Dermot Quigley&rsquo;s report states there is no comprehensive inventory of work done under the PR contract in question, that monitoring and recording of the work done was not satisfactory, and in the case of a number of areas of work, as well as support work at various international meetings, he was not convinced that the services were fully within the scope of the contract? Is the Taoiseach serious when he says the Minister is exonerated? Is he going to lay out criteria to ensure we do not have a repeat of this debacle? Will he set out criteria with regard to foreign travel for consultants, fund raising by consultants for their ministerial employers and for the hiring of consultants? Will he set out performance indicators to measure achievements and performance? Will the Taoiseach put these measures in place and ensure we do not have a repeat of this debacle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the question about the Quigley report and the Standards in Public Office Commission report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about the outcome of the Quigley report and what the Taoiseach intends to do?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1240"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The subject of controversy raised by the Deputy has been examined in detail by two separate bodies. There is nothing to suggest that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, acted inappropriately in the matter in question. The House knows that when we drew up the terms of reference, care was taken to ensure that nothing would be done to pre-empt any investigation the Standards in Public Office Commission might decide to carry out.</P>
      <P>By and large, Mr. Quigley was asked to address the issues relating to the procurement process and he concentrated his inquiry on that area. His report, which is in the public domain, shows that while there are issues we must improve on in the procurement process, the Minister did nothing wrong. The Standards in Public Office Commission found there was no basis on which to undertake an investigation.</P>
      <P>With regard to what I intend to do, I have already stated that we will introduce new procedures to deal with these issues. The Cabinet has discussed and almost finalised these matters and the new procedures will be announced shortly. I hope this will alleviate the pressure with regard to this issue and tighten up the procurement system. The Department of Finance must also examine some aspects of the issue raised by Mr. Quigley. It will do that as part of a review it will undertake on procurement generally. We will follow up on the two aspects raised by Mr. Quigley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach mentioned the Standards in Public Office Commission. I am not surprised it found no <i>prima facie</i> case, given that the Quigley report was quite rushed in the sense that the Taoiseach asked for it to be back on his desk before the D&aacute;il reconvened. The Standards in Public Office Commission had a long debate on the issue. I imagine the members did not all agree on the position, but the commission put a position into the public domain.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think the investigation done was comprehensive? Is it acceptable, given that it was just dealing with procurement? It did not deal with other pertinent issues such as whether a consultant should be able to conduct fund raising for a ministerial employer or some of the issues raised somewhat obliquely in the Quigley report.</P>
      <P>Following on previous investigations carried out by the Taoiseach, is it any wonder there is not much comfort in him saying he will vet appointments made by other Ministers? Are we to expect the Taoiseach to look up every tree in County Waterford, or wherever it happens to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to investigate the merits or otherwise of an appointment? Would it not be better for him to concentrate on the Standards in Public Office Commission putting in place regu<Col N="1241"/>lations and criteria that would ensure it would know what it had to do and could do its job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Again, the Deputy is raising two points. I do not intend to examine every aspect of it. The Government discussed the matter and we have agreed to incorporate guidelines into the Cabinet handbook in this area. These guidelines will apply, particularly in the PR or communications area, where there is a significant element of direct service to a Minister, or where a Minister suggests a name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy or contract. What will happen is that the Secretary General of the relevant Department will be required to inform the Secretary General to the Government who will arrange, if necessary, for the Cabinet secretariat to inquire about any aspects of the proposed procurement that it considers necessary. I hope an inquiry would not be necessary as the procurement process will be strengthened. The Department of Finance is already dealing with that.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy of whether somebody with a contract to a Minister should be involved in fund raising is a wider area. If anybody has a Government contract, should he or she be debarred from political activity and debarred from a significant sector of the State? If some company such as PricewaterhouseCoopers had a contract with the Department of Finance, should everyone in the company be debarred from the system? I do not think that is what we are talking about. The issue concerns whether somebody works directly for a Minister, or works directly in a Minister&rsquo;s office. What we are doing is changing the regulations to deal with that area. Broadening out in a wide area is where this problem started. We have investigated the issue and two bodies have examined it. Mr. Quigley has made suggestions for change, both in the procurement process adopted by the Department of Finance and in our Cabinet handbook. We have taken action on both.</P>

	<P>Before calling on the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, I wish to make a brief comment. Although it does not arise today, in view of the relative lack of clarity in the procedural rules concerning a motion to move the writ for a by-election, I wish to make two points. First, I am allowing the motions to be moved on short notice, in accordance with precedent whereby the four day notice was not insisted upon by a number of my predecessors.</P>
      <P>Second, where arrangements for taking a motion for the issue of a by-election writ are included as a proposal on the Order of Business that day, the motion should be taken after and not before or during the Order of Business. In taking the motion after the Order of Business, the Deputies&rsquo; right to move the motion is not being denied but I feel the House should be afforded the opportunity to make its own arrangements for taking the motions as it sees fit before the motion can be taken. This means the proposal on the Order of Business would be taken first and would accord with our modern practice of organising business in the D&aacute;il.</P>

Kildare North has benefited in the past eight years particularly from the strong voice that Mr. McCreevy represented in Government on behalf of the people of the constituency.

      <P>The Government looks forward to going to the people of Kildare North to ask them in a sensible way whether it is in their interest that they face <Col N="1248"/>the prospect of not being represented by a Government Deputy for the next two and a half years, given the enormous contribution their outgoing Government Deputy made in the past seven or eight years. I believe the people will give a resounding affirmative answer to us in reply to that question.</P>
      <P>Based on Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s record and that of the Government, we are anxious and willing to have our record tested at this time. The only two people who will outwork us on this election campaign are Deputies Durkan and Stagg, whom I am sure will be out day and night working hard for their prospective running mates for the next general election.</P>

	<P>All the indications are that Deputy Stagg is already out running for one of the new brooms which Deputy Rabbitte has brought forward, whom we wish well in their first electoral contest. I was amused by some of the commentary last night about the prospect of the Government deferring this by-election and the Opposition being very anxious to get out there and show the substance of the Mullingar accord, as it lowed with the other livestock in that area.</P>
      <P>I was a by-election candidate who had to wait for six months when the then Government, composed of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, decided that the people of Laois-Offaly could wait for more than six months before it was prepared to take on the motion at that time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to see Deputy Stagg has concluded his canvass for this evening and has returned to the House. From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, the people of Kildare North have an opportunity to decide if three Opposition Deputies will serve their purposes over the next two and a half years or whether they would like to have a Government representative to add to their two distinguished Members from Fine Gael and the Labour Party. We will choose our candidates and we will go forward with a real charter of achievement which was accomplished by my predecessor in the Department of Finance, the long-serving Deputy, Mr. McCreevy.</P>
      <P>During the course of the campaign I will be in the happy position to refer to many of Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s achievements, which have benefited not only the constituency but the country as a whole. To be able to go into a by-election on the basis of reducing unemployment, which is now down to 4.2% of the total workforce &mdash; some 86,000 out of work of a total of 1.8 million &mdash; is an unprecedented record for any Government.</P>
      <P>When one examines the package of tax reform, those who go to work, very many of whom live in Kildare, are better off.  Since Fianna F&aacute;il returned to Government in 1997, it has reduced the live <Col N="1249"/>register by 2,840, notwithstanding that there has been an increase of more than 27,000 in the population of County Kildare. This is another indication of the huge impact this Government has made to the benefit of the people who live in Kildare North as part of the wider community and a country which is the most successful economy in Europe.</P>
      <P>Eminent companies such as Intel, Hewlett-Packard and others have made a record investment in the constituency, exemplifying the modern economy we are building. Mr. McCreevy has a great deal more credit to take than he has ever sought, or has been given him by his opponents in this House, for the enormous changes for the better which have occurred in Kildare since he took the reins of representation in 1977.</P>
      <P>Since then, important investment has been seen at Naas General Hospital, which issue Mr. McCreevy took up after the rainbow coalition looked on helplessly for three years. There was huge investment in the national roads programme and in non-national roads. Investment in public transport, which was a nil figure during the rainbow coalition, was resumed. All of these issues are an indication of Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s impact and influence. Quite apart from the fiscal and financial policies he brought forward on behalf of the Government in successive budgets and which improved the disposable income of working men and women throughout the country, including in his own constituency, these are indications of the impact for the better he made for the people.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Since his leaving office and taking up his post in Europe, one is aware of the enormous admiration for Mr. McCreevy across the party political spectrum; an admiration not replicated for many of us in this House in terms of the esteem and respect in which he was genuinely held for his openness and forthrightness and independent-mindedness. Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats will field two eminently suitable candidates for selection. The merits of our opposition will be extolled by Opposition Deputies this evening as this campaign begins. However, it cannot be contradicted that, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy for Kildare North, Mr. McCreevy was throughout his career a person who made a positive impact and a difference to thousands of people in the county of the lily-whites. We will produce a winner from the Government benches as this campaign begins as a result of the writ being moved.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that the Government has agreed to hold the two by-elections on 11 March. The objective of my party was principally to exercise our traditional prerogative in moving the writ for the Meath by-election. Since I made that announcement on Sunday, most of the indications were that the Government would vote down the writ. I am pleased therefore that in conjunction with the Labour Party, the Government has reconsidered and is now ensuring that the electorates in Meath and Kildare North will have their Oireachtas representation brought back to 2002 levels within a month. In fact, as the boundary commission has recommended that both constituencies will be entitled to an extra seat at the next general election, it is important that the electorates be given the opportunity to fill these seats at an early date.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who like myself is the product of a by-election. In his case, I remember canvassing in Ferbane, where I did not get too many votes, and where the by-election in question was, I think, on the same day as the European elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that right? It was not clear to me at the time. I am glad the Deputy has figured it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I also remember that after the Inchydoney meeting and the thinking that took place at it, the feeling was that the former Deputy McCreevy, then Minister for Finance, who in fairness was always his own man with his own view, was to be removed from the Cabinet or could stay there and be demoted. He was then dispatched to the relative safety of the European Commission where he could no longer be a thorn in the side of some backbenchers, because there was a per<Col N="1251"/>ception that Fianna F&aacute;il was suffering as a consequence of his being Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>In Kildare, Fine Gael has chosen as a candidate councillor Darren Scully, a young man with a very bright future. He is a first-time elected member of Naas Town Council, a young father acutely aware of the needs of north Kildare. No more than anyone else contesting a by-election, this is a difficult time for him. His mother passed away only last week, always an extra burden for any candidate of any party to bear.</P>
      <P>Since the vacancy was announced last July, Fianna F&aacute;il seems to have had some difficulty in the constituency and I am glad that as a consequence of the Cabinet meeting today, it has decided to hold its convention on Thursday. I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who has some relations in the contest, so let the party decides whatever it wants to do. I am sure stories will be told about the selection. However, I expect that the combined strength of the Fine Gael and Labour parties in north Kildare will ensure a victory in this case for the alternative Government.</P>
      <P>I will speak only once in this debate. In respect of Meath we recognise the scale of the challenge. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, is director of elections. I know that over the last 50 years, Fianna F&aacute;il got an average of 47% of the vote in Meath and that the lowest it ever got was 42%, in the 1997 general election when John Bruton was Taoiseach. Given that performance, in fairness to the Fianna F&aacute;il party over the years there is a considerable difficulty for anyone in trying to take that Meath seat. However, Shane McEntee is an exceptional candidate and the people of Meath are fair-minded. In the previous general election they gave two seats to the Fine Gael party and we intend, with an outstanding candidate, to fight this by-election very competitively, to win and to put the credentials of Shane McEntee before the electorate so that it will restore the balance as it did through its general election vote in 2002.</P>
      <P>Both constituencies, making up as they do one of the fastest-growing conurbations in the country, epitomise all the difficulties now faced by modern constituencies on the edge of greater Dublin in terms of commuter travelling times and pressure on housing, mortgages, schools and health services. The Government has failed appallingly in so many of these areas, which is why it must contend with massive public meetings where frustration and anger are expressed by people. The Government members will feel that is they canvass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Are they the meetings the Deputy organised against the M3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who made the point the other day that he wanted long days for the by-election. The <Col N="1252"/>people of Meath are well able to make up their minds on the quality of the candidates, whether the days be dark or bright.</P>
      <P>As far as Fine Gael is concerned, this by-election will be fought strongly but fairly. I will make two points. Given that 11 March is a Friday and given the extreme commuting difficulties faced by people in north Kildare and Meath, the Government should arrange to keep open the polling stations for the maximum time, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., to allow for that. Apathy is the great difficulty in elections these days. It is difficult to make politics exciting in a time of economic prosperity. I hope that across the electorates of Meath and Kildare North, people will register their protest at the concerns flowing into our offices regarding how the Government has failed to deliver. From the Fine Gael perspective, I hope that Shane McEntee in Meath and Darren Scully in Kildare will register their protest votes against the Government on those issues, and in respect of the quality of the candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

I got along very well with him but intend to get along even better with the next Member to be elected in Kildare because I expect it will be a colleague of my own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Darren Scully, a young candidate running for election to the D&aacute;il for the first time, has a great deal to offer and is a fine public speaker. Without any doubt he will be an excellent D&aacute;il Deputy after the by-election.</P>
      <P>The by-election will give Government Deputies an opportunity to visit County Kildare which is a microcosm of the country, in particular the east of the country. They will see the lack of adequate schools, hospital and health services, and policing in terms of the numbers of garda&iacute; promised before the previous general election. They will see the failure to deliver. They will see the number of pre-fab schools, primary and secondary, throughout the constituency. It is disgraceful that in this much-vaunted economy, children exist in such primeval conditions. That is something from which the Government Deputies will learn. They will be able to examine our roads, another <Col N="1253"/>area given Government attention recently in terms of the billions it expects to spend on them. They will be able to see the roads and potholes and that every by-road in the place a disgrace.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government will be very welcome in the constituency, since they will be able to see their own work at first hand. They will also be able to see the disgraceful housing situation, with 3,500 young families on the housing list, many of whom have been sitting there for the last seven years. They will be there for another seven years unless the electorate in Kildare decides otherwise, as I believe they will.</P>
      <P>It will also give an opportunity to both Ministers and backbenchers on the Government side to come forward and see the commuter traffic passing through County Kildare, with people heading far into the country to where they must buy houses, travelling 50, 60 or 70 miles morning and evening to and from work. It will give a great opportunity to Government Deputies to see the effects of this decentralisation at first hand. They had not planned it, except by way of squeezing the young population out of their houses. It will give Ministers and backbenchers an opportunity to see the number of applications for medical cards and rent support that has been refused recently. Seriously ill people have sought rent support and been refused in this much-vaunted economy.</P>
      <P>It will give Ministers, Ministers of State and backbenchers a chance to come to County Kildare and see the results of their handiwork. They will see at first hand that all is not as they present it. It will not be a time for spindoctors but for reality. Reality TV is about to come of age, and I have no doubt that Darren Scully will be victorious, something that I will do my utmost to ensure.</P>
      <P>We should pay tribute to those other candidates in the race. There is no doubt that they are people of integrity, and that will be seen in the course of the election.</P>

I have no idea what all the fuss was about or why such bogus excuses were advanced for not running the elections.

	<P>I am glad that they have now come around to our view. I join with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in wishing former Deputy Charlie McCreevy well. I have no idea what he means when he says that Mr. McCreevy made such an impact that it is a shame he is gone. <Col N="1254"/>We did not send him anywhere; it was the Government that shafted him. If he were making such an impact, why did you send him to Europe? It is a complete mystery to the rest of us.</P>

To do that, the Minister will first have to produce a candidate. If he follows the pattern of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in Meath and gets the wrong candidate the first time, now that the election is under way, he will find great difficulty in changing horses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to promote the credentials of our young candidate, Councillor Paddy McNamara, who was elected at the top of the poll in his area. He is a lecturer dedicated to public service. The only reason the Government parties did not make their minds up until this morning is that they did not want to confront the people, given their experience on the last occasion. It is entirely bogus to send Ministers and Ministers of State out to say they do not want the election because it would disrupt the business of the D&aacute;il. The Taoiseach has just scampered off; he disrupts the business of the D&aacute;il at will. If he had his way, he would close it down entirely. The number of days the D&aacute;il sits was never fewer, and now we find that an extra week has been added to the Easter recess, for no reason that we have been told. There was no consultation between Whips on the issue. The Government simply went ahead and did it.</P>
      <P>It is entirely spurious to say a by-election would disrupt the legislative programme of the D&aacute;il. It would do nothing of the kind, and Ministers know that. The reason is that people want to talk to <Col N="1255"/>the Government about prices, hospitals, medical cards, child care and transport. It is all very well for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to say the boom has created significant extra jobs, as it has for a dozen years. There are more people at work, but they cannot get there.</P>
      <P>We get a fantasy package from the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, who claims we are to invest &euro;10 billion. It reminds me of what happened at Ballymascanlon before the general election. The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced a package of &euro;7.7 billion for the health services. Not only did that never happen; the much-extolled Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, had written to the same Minister three weeks before to say that there was no question of any additional funding being made available. That letter was subsequently published in the national news media.</P>
      <P>The last time I heard of Deputy Callely being busy was when he announced at Christmas that he had intervened with National Toll Roads to stop the 20% increase on the toll bridge. I came over it last night and paid the extra 20%. If Deputy Callely has the same success in delivering the upgrade and investment needed for transport to Kildare, I am afraid the outlook for the county&rsquo;s hard-pressed commuters is very bleak.</P>
      <P>I will resume my seat in favour of my colleague, Deputy Stagg. The one thing the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has said that she is standing by is the Hanly report. I know there is collective amnesia on the Government benches about it, but the people of Kildare should know that if the Minister for Health and Children is standing by it and the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers are standing by her &mdash; I do not want to make that presumption &mdash; the accident and emergency department in Naas is gone. The people of Kildare should know that. I will return to the question.</P>

	<P>The vacancy in Kildare North was created by my personal friend and political opposite, former Deputy McCreevy. He was a good friend of mine, and I wish him well in his banishment to Europe. Appreciation has been shown on the Government side for him, and it was a pity that it was not shown before he was shifted out, since he certainly did not want to go. That is well known there and everywhere else &mdash; it is certainly well known in Kildare.</P><Col N="1256"/>
      <P>For the information of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I have been canvassing with our candidate, who was selected without difficulty, since last November and not merely for the last few minutes. I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to accede to the demand of the Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, and others that the by-election be held in Kildare North without further delay. Given the disarray in Fianna F&aacute;il ranks in the constituency, it is understandable that they were anxious to put off the day of reckoning for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>The disarray to which I refer is well known. The two Fianna F&aacute;il front runners refused to tog out and withdrew from the field of play altogether. Subsequent attempts by Fianna F&aacute;il headquarters to impose a candidate of its choice was and is resisted by the other potential candidates in Fianna F&aacute;il and to make matters worse for Fianna F&aacute;il, the front-runner among the others lives, works and operates politically seven miles outside the Kildare North constituency. He is the likely successor.</P>
      <P>The real reason Fianna F&aacute;il sought to delay the by-election in Kildare North was that it was not ready, it had no candidate and it was in disarray. However, despite the disarray in Fianna F&aacute;il ranks, the combined pressure from Labour and Fine Gael forced the Government, including Fianna F&aacute;il, to cave in and agree to an early date for this election. This is a good day for democracy in general and especially for Kildare North. The electorate will now get the opportunity to pass judgment on the litany of failures and broken promises in my constituency of Kildare North.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party did not have the same difficulty as Fianna F&aacute;il in finding a candidate. In October last year, the Labour Party selected poll-topper Councillor Paddy McNamara as its standard bearer to contest the Kildare North by-election. Paddy is a young married professional who has been togged out and campaigning since then. He has identified five major issues that are of serious concern to the citizens of north Kildare, problems arising from false promises and under-provision &mdash; they are transport, education, child care, housing and health.</P>
      <P>In each of these vital areas of policy and service provision, the Government has failed to deliver or keep its promises. Trains are packed to danger point. New tracks and carriages have not materialised as promised. Pregnant women can no longer travel on trains because of the crush. Promised buses have not been purchased. An extra 15 buses were intended for north Kildare under the Government&rsquo;s plan and they have not been delivered. They would make a huge difference to the morning queues in Celbridge, Maynooth, Leixlip and Naas. The M50 is a modern instrument of torture or very expensive parking lot and all we get are promises of more of the same or worse, as the Taoiseach told us.</P>
      <P>Paddy McNamara found our education system to be in a state of crisis. There are prefabs at every school in north Kildare, both secondary <Col N="1257"/>and primary, but some schools cannot get funding for prefabs from the Government. In Sallins, for example, 50 pupils who were otherwise eligible to do so could not be admitted to primary school this year. In one school in Naas, the entrance age is six years because there is no room to take the pupils. All we have got are houses from massive zoning, mainly by the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors at Kildare County Council level, without the required infrastructure being put in place. Child care and health were two other issues mentioned by my colleague.</P>
      <P>Our candidate, Paddy McNamara, is togged out and ready for action. I now invite Fianna F&aacute;il to find its best man or woman and give him or her a jersey. We should have no more delays. The referee&rsquo;s whistle has been blown and I am confident that at the end of the game, our man, with the co-operation and assistance of the other parties in opposition, will take the seat in Kildare North.</P>

I welcome the opportunity to put on the record the good wishes of the Green Party for the former incumbents, Charlie McCreevy in Kildare North and John Bruton in Meath. I have no doubt they will be missed in many ways but the people of Kildare North and Meath now have an opportunity to review their situation and look to the future. The Green Party will contest those by-elections with that sentiment in mind.</P>
      <P>A by-election is often seen as a barometer of the Government&rsquo;s performance. I have no doubt that will be the case on this occasion and to that extent the Government has good reason not to want these by-elections and try to postpone them for as long as possible. It has been flushed out, however, and we now have a date of 11 March. Given that the Government is squandering a great deal of taxpayers&rsquo; money on projects that do not give any benefit and widen the gap between rich and poor, as well as increasing the debt on future generations from the point of view of energy and environmental degradation, these by-elections will be a serious acid test for the Government.</P>
      <P>A by-election is an opportunity to make a real difference and in the case of our party, which has six TDs, an additional representative, or ideally two, would bring us up to the level where we would be recognised as a group. The dynamics in the D&aacute;il would clearly change in that regard. That <Col N="1258"/>is serious motivation from our point of view to have a successful outing at these by-elections.</P>
      <P>Our candidate, Councillor J.J. Power, representing Naas and County Kildare in general, is somebody whom I look forward to working with, as I have done in Kildare North. Apart from being a family man and an elected councillor, he is someone who is very highly regarded by the people of Kildare. Fianna F&aacute;il will know him well, given that he has a long family tradition in politics, but the Green Party is his chosen party and I know he will highlight the problems which are all too familiar to many people in terms of communities in the area not having proper school, health or public transport facilities.</P>
      <P>Driving from Kildare to Dublin I am aware of the congestion at any time of the day, never mind peak hours, but I also know that opportunities exist to put forward solutions, and many of the Green Party solutions are to do with proper planning, investment in public transport, the provision of local facilities, primary health care and facilities for children. The provision of child care and playground facilities will be warmly welcomed and viewed as a resolution of the problems. I wish Councillor Power well and, on behalf of the Green Party, I hope the by-election will be an opportunity to address all the issues that need to be discussed and that it will be free of the type of in-fighting that sometimes bedevils by-elections.</P>

	<P>I welcome the moving of the writ by the Government in respect of the Kildare by-election. It has been awaited for far too long. The seat should not have been left vacant since last autumn, which is effectively what has taken place. The shenanigans &mdash; there is no other word that can best describe what we have seen over the moving of these writs &mdash; show the dire need for reform of electoral legislation. What is appropriate in this instance is that by-elections should be called within a specified period of the vacancies occurring, and that should be enshrined in legislation. It is the responsibility of the party or the Independent group of the departing Deputy in whatever circumstances, but it should be done within a specified period. The idea that this can go on for a protracted period is simply insulting to the electorate and disenfranchises the specific constituency by rendering it less represented here over a protracted period of time.</P>
      <P>I ask members of Government and those who will form Government in the future to seriously examine this issue as an aspect of electoral reform and ensure that a specified period is laid down in law. These seats are not the property of the parties or the individuals, they are the property of the electorate in the respective constituencies, and what happened here is simply unacceptable.</P>
      <P>If we were to examine the comparison with local government, there can be no doubt in our minds that if a vacancy occurred at local authority level, there would be no such delay. The co-option process, now catered to in local govern<Col N="1259"/>ment legislation, would have been employed, enacted and concluded a long time ago.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Kildare by-election, it is unlikely at this point that our party will contest it. All candidates going forward are taking up an important role and responsibility. Whatever the outcome, I hope the victor will make an important, useful and appreciated contribution in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion. This is an important by-election and a further development of our democratic process. It also shows the urgent need to change Irish society. It will provide an opportunity to support and highlight the case of independent candidates and their important role.</P>
      <P>In this by-election an independent councillor, Catherine Murphy, from Leixlip is standing on her own against the major political parties. She has a great chance of causing a major upset and adding to the number of Independent Deputies in the D&aacute;il. She has been a full-time public representative for many years, working on behalf of the people of Kildare North. She will be contesting the by-election as an independent candidate. Based on her record of public service and commitment to the issues that matter to the community, she is best placed to provide an effective voice for the people of Kildare North in the D&aacute;il. Her track record speaks for itself: she has been a Kildare county councillor since 1991 and a Leixlip town councillor since 1988. She is chairperson of the Kildare Community Network and a member of Kildare County Development Board. She is also a board member of the County Kildare Centres for the Unemployed.</P>
      <P>Councillor Murphy&rsquo;s priorities in the forthcoming by-election are: planning for community need, not private greed, resulting in the building of strong and healthy communities with sports, leisure, education, medical and social facilities; frequent and efficient rail and bus services and expanded taxi services; supporting campaigns for affordable housing and child care; the provision of Garda resources to meet the needs of Kildare North&rsquo;s rapidly growing population; and an increase in Government funding to match the growth in the constituency.</P>
      <P>The by-election is an opportunity for us to show that there are credible independent candidates who are prepared to run. Many Independent Deputies will wish Councillor Murphy well, particularly as she is up against the odds. However, she is an excellent candidate and could prove to be an effective member of this group. If successful, she will bring our numbers in the D&aacute;il up to ten. Members of the public see Independent Deputies as the credible alternative to party political neglect. They see that such Deputies are answerable only to the people, not political parties or vested interests.</P>
      <P>Independent Deputies represent a highly credible percentage of the total numbers in D&aacute;il <Col N="1260"/>&Eacute;ireann. We contribute to all debates in the D&aacute;il, are community based and believe in straight-talking politics, not wasting public money on spin. Independent Deputies have also shown that they can work together, that they can accommodate differences and diversity and that they will always put the people and the country first. Most of us came up the hard way; we never demanded respect, we have always earned it and stuck with the poorer sections of society. That is why I welcome this opportunity to endorse and support Councillor Catherine Murphy.</P>

    <Title>Issue of Writ: Meath By-election.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
      <P LI="1">That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the D&aacute;il to issue his Writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present D&aacute;il consequent on the resignation of Deputy John Bruton, a Member for the Constituency of Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputy English.</P>
      <P>It is an honour for me to open the debate on this motion because, as the House is aware, the voters of Meath entrusted their confidence in my brother, John, over a period of 35 years. That was a major vote of faith in Fine Gael and his service to the constituency.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we have, in Shane McEntee, a candidate who carries on the great political traditions created in County Meath. Shane is steeped in the traditions of the county. His name is synonymous with Gaelic football in County Meath and both he and members of his family have trained teams throughout the county. His family is known for its commitment to many voluntary organisations for a long period and has built up a huge amount of what we term &ldquo;social capital&rdquo;. There is no doubt that County Meath badly needs this because, despite the best efforts of Government over many years, major problems have been created in areas of the county such as Ratoath, Dunshaughlin, Dunboyne and Ashbourne. These places were just villages but have become major centres obliged to absorb huge numbers from Dublin. A similar position obtains in the traditional centres of Trim, Navan and Kells.</P>
      <P>The challenge in the forthcoming by-election is for the people of County Meath to give voice to their frustration with the failure of the Government to address their needs. It is difficult to believe the Government spends three times more on health today than it did seven years ago but that the accident and emergency service is in crisis and that fewer people possess medical cards. In towns such as Ashbourne and Dunboyne there is a complete lack of community and <Col N="1261"/>school facilities to match the pace of growth. The pressures in County Kildare to which Deputies referred earlier are equally apparent in County Meath. Increasing numbers of those who live and vote in County Meath are obliged to rise early, become involved in unendurable commuting difficulties, cope without child care support and fund new schools that are not adequately developed and which lack facilities. The voices of the people to whom I refer need to be heard.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that there was a suggestion from the Government to the effect that the by-election might be delayed. Elections are a great leveller. Everyone is aware of the verdict the people passed on the Government&rsquo;s efforts last year when it was obliged to go before them in the local and European elections. People have not forgotten all that was promised, namely, the end of waiting lists and the fact that first-time buyers would be cherished. None of the promises has come to pass. One can see the extreme pressures caused in counties Meath and Kildare by a lack of proper planning and proper use of the resources given to the Government.</P>
      <P>In Shane McEntee we have the sort of candidate who can give momentum to the need to express what is required throughout County Meath. This is a great opportunity for the people of the county to express their confidence in alternative strategies to address their needs. Many commentators refer to the need to offer an alternative Government and the creation of the basis on which one can be formed. It is to address the problems that counties Meath and Kildare, more than any other, have experienced that such an alternative Government must be forged. This is an opportunity for the parties in opposition to show their capacity to work together to deliver seats in counties Meath and Kildare. I will not spare my efforts in that regard.</P>
      <P>Shane McEntee has already done great work in County Meath. We will deliver a message to the Government, namely, that this country needs change and that it can do so much better than it has done to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the forthcoming by-election in County Meath which I am glad is going ahead. The people of the county and the Opposition had an excellent Deputy in John Bruton. He is greatly missed, particularly in County Meath which has suffered a great deal since the Government came to office.</P>
      <P>We will be campaigning with our excellent candidate, Shane McEntee, whose record stands for itself. His family are well known. He is an upstanding, honest and straightforward man and a hard worker. He has great passion and is stubborn. When he believes in something, he will stand by and fight for it. The three Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies already representing the county do not seem to be fighting for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a discussion earlier with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, in respect of rail services in County Meath. It seemed as it if was the first occasion on which he had heard Navan being mentioned. I wonder whether the Minister discusses Meath issues with them when he is there. I know he is working for the country, but does Meath every get a say at the Cabinet table? Surely the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, can talk to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to secure an update on the Navan line. He did not know that was happening or what was needed but he indicated that he would consider it. I wonder who he sits beside at Cabinet.</P>
      <P>I thought Deputy Johnny Brady and his colleagues would hide when it came to defending the Government&rsquo;s record. Perhaps Deputy Cassidy might give a hand with this election because it will be some challenge. If one accepts the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s point that the outcome of the by-elections will be based on records, I am afraid Fianna F&aacute;il is in for trouble in County Meath. Its record there is terrible. Deputy Johnny Brady must admit this when he goes canvassing. How will he be able to stand on doorsteps where people, four years later, are still waiting for the disabled persons housing grant and are still suffering? I heard him say recently that he has known a woman for the last seven or eight years who still has to leave her house to use the bathroom facilities. What will he say to her when he is looking for the vote? Who was in Government for the last seven or eight years? It was not us. That is the Fianna F&aacute;il record.</P>

	<P>That is a lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>The proof is there. The last time Navan hospital got any investment &mdash; the female medical ward &mdash; was under the rainbow coalition Government. Let us see what it got. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, tried to defend the Government&rsquo;s record as regards Navan hospital. She talked about painting the place and the refurbishment of the accident and emergency department. The accident and emergency department is a cardboard box, a portakabin. To talk of refurbishment is an insult to the people of Meath and they will not forget that.</P>
      <P>I warn anyone coming to Meath to bring a car because one cannot get access by rail. If there is a meeting at 10 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, one had better leave at 7 o&rsquo;clock because there is no guarantee of getting there on time. That is because the Government is failing.</P>

	<P>I will continue when the Deputies are finished. We do not often see that great man, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in County Meath. I hope the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, took the opportunity to inform him, when he was talking to him at the Cabinet table, that we have the <Col N="1264"/>same number of garda&iacute; in Navan as we had 20 years ago. The population of Meath has jumped by 26,000 in the last five years. Navan&rsquo;s population has doubled. One imagines that would justify a few extra garda&iacute;, yet the number has stayed the same. That is indefensible and is pure neglect. Mr. Shane McEntee will have an easy election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to conclude, but I should be given a few extra minutes. I will make one last point. Anyone who is canvassing in Meath should not look to change his or her job while there. To look for a new job in Meath is like trying to find a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There is none there. IDA Ireland jobs have been reduced over the last number of years. Most towns have seen a reduction in employment. A few might be created because of decentralisation moves to Trim but, overall, no new jobs have been created for the people of Meath. The record stands for itself. The Government is failing the people of Meath. They will not forget this in three and half weeks&rsquo; time. We are looking forward to it and the people are looking forward to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Penrose. Today is a good day for democratic accountability and for the people of County Meath and County Kildare. Both the Labour Party candidates, Mr. Dominic Hannigan in Meath and Mr. Paddy McNamara in Kildare, have been campaigning since well before Christmas. Both of them will welcome an opportunity now to put their cases to the electorate. It is quite clear that the Government did not want to have by-elections. It was resistant and was forced to climb down as a result of pressure from the Opposition. Despite the fact that the appointment of former Deputy McCreevy dates from July and former Deputy John Bruton from last autumn, it was necessary to have by-elections to ensure that the people of those constituencies had full representation in Parliament. However, the indication from Government was that it wanted to postpone, delay and avoid the inevitable.</P>
      <P>I thought it ironic when the Taoiseach said that having by-elections would interfere with D&aacute;il business. The Taoiseach, more than any other Member of this House, has tried to ensure that D&aacute;il business does not carry on to its full capacity. Holidays have been extended and he disappears on a Wednesday. In fact, this is the Taoiseach who has no difficulty in providing Government Ministers with an extra week off to go to Cheltenham. It is somewhat rich of him to start to make an argument like this. The reality is these are important by-elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In Councillor Dominic Hannigan, we have the type of candidate who would excel in this House. He would represent the people of County Meath in a new dynamic way that they deserve. He has shown himself to be a man of energy and commitment, somebody who wants to service the people and his own community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker><Col N="1266"/>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to hold off for a minute. I know he has talked a good deal about these by-elections, but he has not said anything. He should let other people talk because these are important by-elections. This would provide the first opportunity since the local elections in June for the people to have their say. I have no doubt that the Government is going to get a rough drubbing, as it did in the local elections. In particular there is a strong case to be made to ensure that the Government is not permitted to hold four seats out of the five. Labour Party Councillor Dominic Hannigan has been campaigning intensively for several months and is in a good position, not just to express the frustrations of the people of County Meath at the Government&rsquo;s shortcomings, but to ensure they are met.</P>
      <P>Some of the issues need to be recorded here. Meath has some of the largest classroom sizes in the country. According to figures obtained recently, there are 5,715 pupils in Meath schools in classes of more than 30. This is despite promise after promise from the Minister for Education and Science to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. Meath has suffered from medical card cutbacks. Since the Government came into power in 1997, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have taken 8,312 medical cards out of the hands of people in need. This is type of issue which needs strong representation. I look forward to Councillor Dominic Hanigan become Deputy Dominic Hannigan in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to go into the nice, fresh lands of Meath as director of elections for the Labour Party and particularly for the candidate, Mr. Dominic Hannigan. He reminds me of myself, when I started off. Many people, particularly from the large parties, wrote me off. They will attempt to do the same to Mr. Hannigan at their peril. He has been campaigning since December. He is young, enthusiastic, vibrant and intelligent, somebody who really wants to represent the people. One has to have the enthusiasm to want to represent the people.</P>
      <P>I have had the opportunity to visit Meath. I do not purport to know everything about it, but I know that some parts of Westmeath have been annexed for the next elections. I noticed that the Minister was in that part of our county last week and I was surprised that Deputy Brady was not there. I do not know why he was not invited, because he is someone who&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Mick Dollard did not want him there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; lives very close to the area. I know he has an interest in the area. Deputy Mary Wallace lives a little further away than that, but she does have relations in Mullingar. Dominic Hannigan&rsquo;s priorities are noticeable on the campaign trail, as they are important to the people of Meath. These priorities include an enhanced rail and public transport service for Meath, an end to <Col N="1267"/>the school and child-care crisis that faces hundreds of families across the county and the upgrading of the hospital facilities and major investment in primary care. We believe in upgrading hospital facilities. We do not believe in photo-opportunities where people arrive and get a photograph taken for the papers. A Minister did that in Mullingar, County Westmeath and then she disappeared, even though the 12 bed unit she visited was closed and would not open for another two months. The people of Meath do not want that kind of thing. It is time to cut out the nonsense where people are treated like fools. This Government is renowned for that and we will be telling them so on the doorsteps. The Government has three representatives in Meath and it does not want another one. It is taking people for fools. I have never taken a person for a fool. I treat people as they are, I treat them fairly.</P>
      <P>We also need intelligent planning where people are put before profit. There are big estates in Navan, Athboy and Trim and I have been in them. Why is planning permission given to developers when they fail to complete estates to the required norms and to the exact specifications of the planning conditions? The Labour Party brought a Bill before the House in the name of Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan that was turned down. Why was it turned down? Dominic Hannigan, as chairperson of the planning committee on Meath County Council, will make sure that those issues are chased without fear or favour. He is someone who will bring the issues to the floor of this House in the same way he has articulated them at Meath County Council.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a young mother on a doorstep in Navan the other day, who was looking after her own mother inside. She told me that her mother gets one day&rsquo;s respite care every year. That is some society about which the Government blows its trumpet. I asked her where the respite care places were in Navan. She told me that there was one. I asked her could she not even get that one but she replied they were lucky they got one.</P>

Where are the respite care facilities? I welcomed the disability legislation, but I have listened to what people are telling me about it. We need to look after such people, people who need social and affordable housing. We need to improve their quality of life. These are the issues that we will articulate in the Labour Party.</P><Col N="1268"/>

Meath will not be taken for granted and there are many issues about which the people feel angry. The Green Party candidate, Fergal O&rsquo;Byrne, has been a campaigner and community worker for many years and knows how the pernicious and rapacious policies on waste have been carried out in an out-of-sight, out-of-mind manner.

I welcome the Government&rsquo;s acceptance of the writ for the Meath by-election. The Sinn F&eacute;in candidate, Councillor Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, has been on the campaign trail for weeks. He is by far the best known and the most experienced candidate in the field. He has a proven record in community leadership in local government and he has played a key role in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s national project for lasting peace and an Ireland of equals. He is chair of the forum which brings together our elected representatives from throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and he has performed in that role admirably for a number of years.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>These by-elections will take place two and a half years into the term of this Government. Undoubtedly, it will be a poll on the Government, not only in Meath and in north Kildare, but throughout the State. County Meath is a prime example of how the State has been misgoverned over the past decade. The long term residents and those who have moved there in recent years are victims of bad planning&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and a lack of planning that has characterised economic development under the Government. The Deputy should be aware of that. The great shortage of affordable housing in Dublin has pushed people into surrounding counties, including my own constituency. Counties Meath and Kildare continue to take up the greatest outflow of people from Dublin. However, the jobs have not followed and this point has been made repeatedly by speakers from the Opposition.</P>
      <P>County Meath has, in effect, become a giant suburb of Dublin from which many thousands commute to the capital every day. There is no proper public transport infrastructure and the roads are unable to cope with the volume of daily traffic.</P>

They demand the equitable and efficient health service they and we have been promised so often and clearly deserve.</P>
      <P>The people of County Meath have not had the representation they deserve. Deputy Brady is a perfect example. If there was ever an example of the need for change in County Meath, the Deputy epitomises it 100%. Recognising that they demand change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Councillor Joe Reilly is the voice of real change in County Meath. I have every confidence that, much to Deputy Brady&rsquo;s heartache, he will take the vacant seat in this corner of the House after the by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I had not realised the moving of a writ could be so exciting. It is a mixture of tributes and party political broadcasts. I pay tribute to the Deputies who have left the House and who were independent-minded individuals. I hope the by-election will throw up a genuine independent candidate rather than someone attached to a party. There are strong independent candidates in both constituencies. While I am pleased the <Col N="1271"/>Government has decided to go ahead and announce a date, I cannot understand what difference another two weeks would have made. A great deal of political capital was made out of something from which there was no need to make political capital. It is now done but it would have been a travesty of justice if County Meath had been left without a Deputy for a long period.</P>
      <P>As Deputy English said, the population of County Meath increased by 22% between 1996 and 2000. It increased by 86% between 1971 and 2002. It increases daily. In villages like Ratoath where the population has increased by approximately 250% there are significant implications for services and people living in the area. The county shares a substantial border with my constituency and what happens within it has serious implications for County Cavan.</P>
      <P>There has not been enough emphasis placed on the M3 project. I would like to know what positions people are taking on the development. Every candidate should be asked about the effect the M3 will have in County Meath as well as County Cavan. It will make County Cavan much more accessible to industry and big business. I will be examining what people have to say on this issue as it cannot be dodged. That it can take half a day to get through County Meath informs our perspective on the project. The issue must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The issue of the hospital in Navan must be considered also. I read in the newspaper today that 11 hospitals had been told not to accept paediatric admissions. Every candidate must address this issue on the doorsteps.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that polling stations will be open until 9 p.m. to facilitate workers and students. Many students who return to the constituency from Dublin will be tired or want to catch up with friends or play football and politics will not be at the top of their agenda. We should consider setting up polling stations in Dublin. There is no reason one station could not accommodate students from counties Kildare and Meath. Students should be allowed to exercise their voting rights from Dublin.</P>
      <P>I want to know if electronic voting machines will be taken out of storage for the by-elections. It is costing a great deal of money to store them.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Connolly proposes the use of electronic voting machines for the by-election in County Meath, he will have the full support of Deputies on this side of the House as well as Deputy English. The system worked excellently before to give us a fast, good result. Fianna F&aacute;il won three seats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a fast result all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael did not do too badly either. The by-election in County Meath is caused by the departure of former Deputy John Bruton. While we were political rivals and at different points of the political spectrum for many years, I take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution he made to politics, County Meath, Ireland and Europe. As I have done previously, I wish him a very successful tenure in Washington as EU ambassador.</P>
      <P>John Bruton was first elected to the House in 1969 as a young man of 22 years. The by-election gives a great opportunity to the County Meath electorate to elect another young man of undoubted ability. Mr. Shane Cassells is an excellent candidate and, despite being relatively young, has a wealth of experience. He was the youngest councillor elected to Meath County Council in 1999 and in 2004 the youngest ever mayor of Navan where he was elected to the town council in 1999.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cassells has served at various levels in the Fianna F&aacute;il organisation during the years and his family has a long tradition in the party and a proud name. While people outside County Meath put the emphasis on the second syllable when pronouncing the family name, we place it on the first. Peter Cassells is Shane&rsquo;s uncle while another served Meath well on playing fields throughout Ireland. His family is very proud of his decision to put his name forward to serve the local community in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cassells belongs to a new generation in Irish politics. It is great to see someone in his mid-20s putting himself forward for election. As we have a young Deputy from the constituency on the other side of the House, it is important to ensure balance on this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be hard to balance Deputy Johnny Brady.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I testify to Mr. Cassells&rsquo; capacity as a councillor. He has shown in the past five or six years immense aptitude for hard work and a great grasp of detail which are invaluable qualities in a modern and effective politician. He will work very hard on behalf of the organisation and the people of the county. He said today that the by-election offered the voters of County Meath a chance to support a new generation of strong representatives who could voice local concerns at <Col N="1273"/>national level. I have no doubt that he will help to capitalise on the unprecedented investment made in the county in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies can see only that a glass is either half full or empty. Deputy Bruton spoke of an alternative to Fianna F&aacute;il. He is looking for an alternative to the massive expenditure on water, sewerage, housing, roads and schools in the constituency since 1997. We have made a massive commitment to roads and motorways in the county as well as schools. I could name schools in every part of County Meath. Almost &euro;10 million has been spent in County Meath in terms of grants from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We are fully committed to the hospital and have invested in it. It is difficult to listen to the truth.</P>

	<P>We have the lowest level of unemployment ever in County Meath. The Government continues to provide infrastructure in the county. Up until 1997, Meath&rsquo;s economic development was hindered by a lack of infrastructure, but we have rectified that and turned it around.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connolly with regard to the issue of the M3. It is time that every Deputy &mdash; and prospective Deputy &mdash; put his or her cards on the table with regard to that issue. People cannot talk out of both sides of their mouth.

	<P Just="Left">Molaim go l&eacute;if&iacute; an Bille seo don Dara hUair.</P>
      <P>T&aacute;im an-sh&aacute;sta go bhfuilim anseo inniu chun an Bille um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il 2004 a chur i l&aacute;thair, Bille a mheasaim a bheith ina thogra reachta&iacute;ochta an-th&aacute;bhachtach. Cuims&iacute;onn s&eacute; athnuachan riachtanach d&aacute;r ndl&iacute; chun a chinnti&uacute; gur f&eacute;idir linn cionta coiri&uacute;la a imscr&uacute;d&uacute; agus a ionch&uacute;iseamh i sl&iacute; at&aacute;&eacute;ifeachtacht agus cothrom agus a chomhl&iacute;onann riachtanais an tsocha&iacute; nua-aimseartha.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; f&eacute;ar&aacute;ilte a r&aacute; go gcrutha&iacute;onn an cheist d&rsquo;athch&oacute;iri&uacute; dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an-l&aacute;idir i measc an phobail. Bheadh d&iacute;om&aacute; orm mura nd&eacute;anadh s&eacute;&eacute; sin. Is gn&eacute; th&aacute;bhachtach de dhaonlathas bunreacht&uacute;il beomhar &eacute; mionscr&uacute;d&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar aon mholta&iacute; a thagann &oacute;n Rialtas agus deirim nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n r&eacute;ims&iacute; gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta Rialtais at&aacute; n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; nuair a bhaineann s&eacute; le molta&iacute; chun &aacute;r ndl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il a l&eacute;as&uacute;.</P>
      <P>Aonta&iacute;mid go l&eacute;ir gur ch&oacute;ir go bpion&oacute;s&oacute;fa&iacute; coirpigh agus gur ch&oacute;ir an tsocha&iacute; a chosaint in aghaidh caire ach t&aacute; bun-riachtanas le cinnti&uacute; go dtugann &aacute;r ndl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il aird do chearta agus shaoirse an duine. T&aacute; me&aacute; chritici&uacute;il le f&aacute;il idir an g&aacute; le haghaidh gn&iacute;omh l&aacute;idir agus &eacute;ifeachtacht ar l&aacute;mh amh&aacute;in, agus le haghaidh caomhn&uacute; de chearta an duine, ar an l&aacute;mh eile.</P>
      <P>Is &eacute; pr&iacute;omh-fh&oacute;cas an Bhille seo n&aacute; an mhe&aacute; sin a lorg. T&aacute; na molta&iacute; at&aacute;&aacute; chur ar aghaidh agam sa Bhille seo chomh cothrom chun a chinnti&uacute; go bhf&eacute;adfaimis, mar shocha&iacute;, aghaidh a thabhairt ar na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in a bhaineann le coirpeacht nua-aimseartha, agus ag an am ch&eacute;anna bunchearta agus riail an dl&iacute; a urram&uacute;.</P>
      <P>Ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile cloistear guthanna &aacute; athphl&eacute; na call&oacute;ide go dt&oacute;gann cearta cosanta an tsocha&iacute; an dara h&aacute;it chun cothroma&iacute;ocht a chinnti&uacute; don amhrastach &mdash; i bhfocal eile go bhfuil an mhe&aacute; gluaiste an iomad i bhfabhar an ch&uacute;is&iacute;. Creidim gur ceist dlisteanach &eacute; seo a chaithfear a phl&eacute; agus t&aacute;im &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh sin sa Bhille seo &mdash; f&oacute;s ag iarraidh nach dtarla&iacute;onn a mhalairt. Caithfimid cosaint in aghaidh na gcothroime a ghluaiseacht an iomad toisc go mbeadh iomrall ceartais mar thoradh ar a leith&eacute;id. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r roimh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta a bhfuilim d&oacute;chasach go n-&eacute;ireoidh as mo mholta&iacute; sa Teach seo maidir leis sin.</P>
      <P>Is &eacute; pr&iacute;omh-chusp&oacute;ir an Bhille um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il n&aacute;&aacute;r ndl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il a thabhairt suas chun d&aacute;ta chun &eacute;ifeachtacht &aacute;r gc&oacute;ras dl&iacute; a fheabhs&uacute; i leith coir a ionch&uacute;iseamh agus a phion&oacute;s&uacute;. Iarrann an Bille seo &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; chumhachta&iacute; na ngarda&iacute; a chur chun chinn chun coir a imscr&uacute;d&uacute;. N&iacute; h&eacute; an cine&aacute;l Bille &eacute; seo a chuirfeadh Aire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus <Col N="1277"/>Athch&oacute;irithe Dl&iacute; ar aghaidh gan pr&oacute;iseas fada agus c&uacute;ramach scr&uacute;daithe. Go deimhin bh&iacute; tr&eacute;imhse ghoir fhada ag an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>Bh&iacute; a bhun&uacute;s i dtuarasc&aacute;il an ghr&uacute;pa sti&uacute;rtha ar &eacute;ifeachtacht agus ar fheidhmi&uacute;lacht an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, tagartha go coitianta mar an tuarasc&aacute;il Gharda SMI. Foils&iacute;odh an tuarasc&aacute;il sin i m&iacute; na Samhna 1997. Fad is a bhaineann s&eacute; le strucht&uacute;r agus feidhmeanna an Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, mhol s&eacute; chomh maith athruithe &aacute;irithe don dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il a shonraigh s&eacute; a chuirfeadh &eacute;ifeachtacht agus feidhmi&uacute;lacht na nGarda&iacute; chun cinn chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le coiri&uacute;lacht. Ghlac an gr&uacute;pa sti&uacute;rtha, &aacute;fach, go mbeadh g&aacute; ann chun impleachta&iacute; a mholta&iacute; a mheas a thuilleadh de r&eacute;ir for&aacute;lacha an Bhunreachta agus an Choinbhinsi&uacute;in Eorpach um Chearta an Duine. Mar thoradh ar sin, bhunaigh an tAire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athch&oacute;irithe Dl&iacute; ag an am, Teachta &Oacute; Donnch&uacute;, gr&uacute;pa saineolaithe chun a leith&eacute;id de mheas&uacute;nachta a shol&aacute;thar agus chuir s&eacute; an tuarasc&aacute;il seo faoi bhr&aacute;id an Aire ag deireadh mh&iacute; l&uacute;il 1998. Ba &eacute; Eamonn Leahy SC, tr&oacute;caire air, a bh&iacute; mar chathaoirleach ar an ngr&uacute;pa.</P>
      <P>Pointe oiri&uacute;nach &eacute; seo chun on&oacute;ir a thabhairt d'Eamonn agus t&aacute; a fhios agam go motha&iacute;onn an Teach na moth&uacute;chain ch&eacute;anna at&aacute; a chur in i&uacute;l agam anseo. Ba thubaiste an domhain &eacute; b&aacute;s anaba&iacute; Eamonn do gach duine, go h&aacute;irithe sinne at&aacute; ag iarraidh a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il &eacute;ifeachtach, feidhmi&uacute;il agus cothrom. T&aacute;imid go l&eacute;ir faoina chomaoin le tuarasc&aacute;il a eisi&uacute;int le molta&iacute; at&aacute; mar bhunchloch an Bhille seo. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
      <P>Mhol an tuarasc&aacute;il roinnt athruithe sa dl&iacute;, san &aacute;ireamh cinn bainteach le cumhacht na nGarda&iacute; chun l&aacute;thair na coire a chaomhn&uacute;, chun bar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh a chur ar f&aacute;il in &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute;&aacute;irithe ag baint le cionta tromch&uacute;iseacha, chun fianaise a urghabh&aacute;il de chionta a dh&eacute;anamh agus chun amhrastaigh a ghabh&aacute;il agus a choinne&aacute;il. Cheadaigh an Rialtas sc&eacute;im ghinear&aacute;lta de bhille a dhr&eacute;acht&uacute;, bunaithe ar Thuarasc&aacute;il an ghr&uacute;pa shaineolaithe, ar an 15 Feabhra 2000.</P>
      <P>Nuair a th&aacute;inig m&eacute; in oifig bheartaigh m&eacute; ar an sc&eacute;im ghinear&aacute;lta a athbhreithni&uacute;. Rinne m&eacute; athruithe don ch&eacute;ad sc&eacute;im agus chuir m&eacute; roinnt fhor&aacute;lacha breise leis, thar agus n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; na cinn molta ag an ngr&uacute;pa sti&uacute;rtha, chun forbairt&iacute; a chur san &aacute;ireamh &oacute; fhoilsi&uacute; na tuarasc&aacute;la sin i m&iacute; na Samhna 1998. De thoradh ar seo, t&aacute; an Bille seo suas chun d&aacute;ta i dt&eacute;arma&iacute; na nithe at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il ag an dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il ag an am seo a shol&aacute;thar. Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; freisin go dteasta&iacute;onn uaim go mbeireann an Bille seo luach reacht&uacute;il chomh m&oacute;r agus is f&eacute;idir sa throid ina aghaidh coire agus ina theannta sin i rith a phas&aacute;iste tr&iacute;d an Teach seo t&aacute; s&eacute; ar intinn agam tuilleadh togra&iacute; a thabhairt ar aghaidh mar leas&uacute; ar an mBille seo. Tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar ais go dt&iacute; na togra&iacute; seo n&iacute;os deana&iacute;.</P>
      <P>Ba choir dom a lua go bhfuilim ag &uacute;s&aacute;id na deise &aacute; chur i l&aacute;thair ag an mBille chun leasuithe t&aacute;bhachtacha, go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; leo, a dh&eacute;anamh don reachta&iacute;ocht airm tine. Cuims&iacute;onn an Bille alt amh&aacute;in cheana ag baint le coime&aacute;d sl&aacute;n <Col N="1278"/>d&rsquo;airm. Beidh m&eacute; ag moladh for&aacute;lacha breise eile chomh maith agus luafaidh m&eacute; iad seo i gcomhth&eacute;acs na leasuithe go ginear&aacute;lta.</P>
      <P>Beidh s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir &oacute;n gcur chuige seo go bhfuil s&eacute; ar intinn agam go l&eacute;ireodh an Bille seo na riachtanais nua-aimseartha go hioml&aacute;n. Seasann s&eacute; don dl&iacute; a thabhairt suas chun d&aacute;ta go forleathan maidir le cionta a imscr&uacute;d&uacute; agus a ionch&uacute;iseamh.</P>
      <P>San &aacute;ireamh ar na bearta sa Bhille t&aacute; cumhacht reacht&uacute;il chun l&aacute;thair na coire a chaomhn&uacute;; cumhacht ghinear&aacute;lta maidir le bar&aacute;ntais chuardaigh a eisi&uacute;int; cumhacht choinne&aacute;la m&eacute;adaithe suas go 24 uair le haghaidh cionta inghabh&aacute;la; roinnt leasuithe don Acht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il (Fianaise Dl&iacute;-Eola&iacute;ochta) 1990, go h&aacute;irithe chun sampla de sheile agus sv&aacute;b b&eacute;il a ath-rang&uacute; mar shampla&iacute; neamh-phr&iacute;obha&iacute;deach; cumhacht an ionch&uacute;isimh a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; chun achomharc a dh&eacute;anamh i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; teoranta, go h&aacute;irithe maidir le point&iacute; an dl&iacute;; for&aacute;lacha ginear&aacute;lta, de chin&eacute;al teicni&uacute;il don chuid is m&oacute;, chun &eacute;ifeachtacht a chur chun cinn in ionch&uacute;iseamh cionta; for&aacute;il ar inghlacthacht na r&aacute;itis ag finn&eacute;ithe, a dhi&uacute;lta&iacute;onn ar fhian&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh n&oacute; a dh&eacute;anann a ch&eacute;ad r&aacute;iteas a aisghlacadh, ina dhiaidh sin; for&aacute;il le haghaidh n&oacute;s imeachta pion&oacute;is seasta maidir le cionta oird phoibl&iacute;&aacute;irithe nach bhfuil trom-ch&uacute;iseach; agus leas&uacute; d&rsquo;Achtanna na nArm Tine a fhor&aacute;lfaidh go mbeidh ar iarratas&uacute;ir&iacute; do theastais airm tine Ceannfort na nGarda&iacute; a sh&aacute;samh go bhfuil loist&iacute;n daingean curtha ar f&aacute;il acu don arm tine sin.</P>
      <P>Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; cheana, t&aacute; cothroma&iacute;ocht le f&aacute;il sa Bhille i leith an g&aacute; d&rsquo;&eacute;ifeachtacht in aghaidh coiri&uacute;lachta agus an g&aacute; do chearta indibhidi&uacute;la &aacute;irithe a choime&aacute;d sl&aacute;n. Toisc an riachtanas go mba ch&oacute;ir &eacute; sin a bheith mar an ghn&aacute;ch bh&iacute; na pr&iacute;omh-thogra&iacute; sa Bhille seo scr&uacute;daithe go mion ag an ngr&uacute;pa saineolaithe. Ba mhaith liom a chur in i&uacute;l don Teach freisin gur lorg m&eacute;, agus go raibh m&eacute; bu&iacute;och as, tuairim&iacute; an Choimisi&uacute;in um Chearta an Duine ar sc&eacute;im ghinear&aacute;lta an Bhille. Thug m&eacute; na tuairim&iacute; sin san &aacute;ireamh nuair a bh&iacute; s&eacute; oiri&uacute;nach. Ba ch&oacute;ir dom a r&aacute; leis, &oacute; foils&iacute;odh an Bille, go bhfuair m&eacute; tuilleadh tuairim&iacute;&oacute;n gcoimisi&uacute;in ar an mBille foilsithe at&aacute;&aacute; scrud&uacute; agam faoi l&aacute;thair. D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; tagairt sa chur i l&aacute;thair seo do roinnt de thuairim&iacute; an choimisi&uacute;in ach de bharr iallaigh ama, beidh orm bheith gearr. Go deimhin is f&eacute;idir iad a phl&eacute; a thuilleadh le linn imeachta an Bhille tr&iacute; na Tithe.</P>
      <P>Ag casadh anois ar shonra&iacute; an Bhille, ba mhaith liom l&eacute;iri&uacute; gairid a dh&eacute;anamh go haicearrach ar na pr&iacute;omh-fhor&aacute;lacha. Baineann Cuid 2 den Bhille leis an imscr&uacute;d&uacute; coire agus l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; molta&iacute; na tuarasc&aacute;la saineolaithe go m&oacute;r mh&oacute;r.</P>
      <P>Is &iacute; aidhm alt 4 n&aacute; chun easnamh sa dl&iacute; coiri&uacute;il a cheart&uacute; ag sol&aacute;thar cumhachta reacht&uacute;la chun l&aacute;thair na coire a chaomhn&uacute;, go h&aacute;irithe daoine a chosc &oacute; theacht isteach sa l&aacute;thair agus trasn&aacute;il air n&oacute; folmh&uacute; fianaise. For&aacute;lann an t-alt seo san &aacute;it ina bhfuil Garda in &aacute;it go dleachtach a chreideann s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; ar bonn r&eacute;as&uacute;nta go bhfuil cionta inghabh&aacute;la d&eacute;anta, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute;/s&iacute; an l&aacute;thair a chaomhn&uacute; go dt&iacute; go mbeidh treor&uacute; tugtha ag <Col N="1279"/>ceannfort Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na chun an l&aacute;thair a chaomhn&uacute;. D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh treor&uacute; &oacute; cheannfort Gharda seasamh ar feadh suas go 24 huaire. Ina dhiaidh sin d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh an Ch&uacute;irt D&uacute;iche, ar iarratas &oacute; cheannfort Garda, an treor&uacute; caomhnaithe a leathn&uacute; suas go tr&iacute; thr&eacute;imhse gach ceann de 48 n-uaire. I gc&aacute;sanna iomad&uacute;la d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh an Ard-Ch&uacute;irt an t-ord&uacute; caomhnaithe a leathn&uacute; le haghaidh tr&eacute;imhse gan spriocdh&aacute;ta.</P>
      <P>Baineann alt 5 le bar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh agus leasa&iacute;onn s&eacute; an chumhacht chuardaigh at&aacute; ann anois agus at&aacute; for&aacute;ilte in alt 10 den Acht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il (For&aacute;lacha Ilghn&eacute;itheacha) 1997. For&aacute;lann alt 10 d&rsquo;eisi&uacute;int ag breitheamh na C&uacute;irte D&uacute;iche de bhar&aacute;ntas ag tabhairt cead do Gharda &aacute;it a chuardach le haghaidh fianaise do chionta tromch&uacute;iseacha, cuirim i gc&aacute;s cionta ind&iacute;ot&aacute;ilte ag baint le b&aacute;s duine, n&oacute; dochar coirp tromch&uacute;iseach do dhuine &eacute;igin, pr&iacute;os&uacute;nacht neamhdhleathach, &eacute;igni&uacute;, agus cionta colla&iacute;&aacute;irithe eile. Leathna&iacute;onn alt 5 na cionta cl&uacute;daithe ag alt 10 chun cionta inghabh&aacute;la a th&oacute;g&aacute;il san &aacute;ireamh, is &eacute; sin a r&aacute; gach cion at&aacute;&aacute; phion&oacute;s&uacute; le coime&aacute;d de ch&uacute;ig bliana n&oacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute;. T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-aont&oacute;idh an Teach liom gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an chumhacht chun bar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh &uacute;daraithe a fh&aacute;il ar f&aacute;il go ginear&aacute;lta do na garda&iacute; le haghaidh gach cion tromch&uacute;iseach. Cuirim leis go mbeadh an chumhacht ghinear&aacute;lta a bheadh ar f&aacute;il gan dochar don chumhacht chuardaigh at&aacute; le f&aacute;il i reachtanna indibhidi&uacute;la. Cinnteoidh s&eacute; nach mbeidh aon bhearna ar iarraidh ann, i gc&aacute;s cionta inghabh&aacute;la indibhidi&uacute;la nach bhfuil cumhacht chuardaigh ar f&aacute;il faoina gcoinne i l&aacute;thair na huaire.</P>
      <P>T&aacute;im ag d&eacute;anamh leasuithe teicni&uacute;la eile don alt seo freisin. Mar shampla, t&aacute; cruinneas focail na for&aacute;la &aacute; athr&uacute; chun go mbeadh deis ag an mbreitheamh iarratas a chead&uacute; m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; s&aacute;sta gur cheart d&oacute; n&oacute; di a leith&eacute;id a dh&eacute;anamh ar bhonn de &ldquo;eolas ar mhionn&rdquo;. Seo &iacute; an fhoirmle focal &aacute;&uacute;saidtear i bhfor&aacute;lacha cuardaigh go traidisi&uacute;nta agus de ghn&aacute;th feidhm&iacute;onn s&eacute; sa chaoi go dt&oacute;gann oifigeach Garda mionnscr&iacute;bhinn faoi mhionn, ar a bhf&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; a bheith ceistithe ag an mbreitheamh.  Athra&iacute;odh an fhoirmle sin in alt 10 den Acht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il (Foralacha Ilghn&eacute;itheacha) 1997, agus chomh maith i bhfor&aacute;lacha cuardaigh na nAchtanna a thagra&iacute;tear d&oacute;ibh in ailt 35, 36 agus 37, go dt&iacute;&ldquo;ar &eacute;isteacht na fianaise faoi mhionn&rdquo;. Chuir an fhoirmle focal nua seo roinnt neamhchinnteachta faoi bhun maidir leis an gcleachtas agus n&oacute;s imeachta is c&oacute;ir a ghlacadh agus bar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh &aacute; lorg. D&rsquo;fhonn an t-&aacute;bhar a bheith gan dabht t&aacute;im &aacute; mholadh go bhfillf&iacute; ar na focail at&aacute; curtha taoi thriail agus taoi mhuin&iacute;n &mdash; t&aacute; na hathruithe riachtanacha &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh de r&eacute;ir ailt 5, 35, 36 agus 37.</P>
      <P>For&aacute;lann an t-alt seo freisin gurbh fh&eacute;idir le Ceannfort Gharda S&iacute;och&aacute;na bar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh &eacute;igeand&aacute;la a eisi&uacute;int san &aacute;it nach bhfuil s&eacute; praitici&uacute;il bar&aacute;ntas c&uacute;irte a fh&aacute;il toisc c&uacute;rsa&iacute; dithnis. Cuireann an Coimisi&uacute;in um Chearta an Duine in i&uacute;l ina thuairim&iacute; ar an sc&eacute;im an g&aacute; le smacht brei<Col N="1280"/>thi&uacute;nach ar eisi&uacute;int de bhar&aacute;ntas cuardaigh. N&iacute; d&oacute;igh leis an gcoimisi&uacute;in go bhfuil c&aacute;s d&eacute;anta go bhfuil g&aacute; ann bar&aacute;ntas &eacute;igeand&aacute;la &aacute;&uacute;dar&uacute; ag ceannfort Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Measann an coimisi&uacute;in go bhf&eacute;adta&iacute; na deacrachta&iacute; praitici&uacute;la i mbreithimh na C&uacute;irte D&uacute;iche a fh&aacute;il a sh&aacute;r&uacute; le r&eacute;itigh eile. Aonta&iacute;m go bhfuil smacht breithi&uacute;nach ar eisi&uacute;int na mbar&aacute;ntas an-t&aacute;bhachtach. T&aacute; an fhor&aacute;il sa Bhille a fhor&aacute;lann do bhar&aacute;ntais &eacute;igeand&aacute;la bunaithe ar fhor&aacute;lacha den chin&eacute;al c&eacute;anna san Acht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il (G&aacute;inne&aacute;il ar Dhruga&iacute;) 1996 agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir &eacute; a &uacute;s&aacute;id ach i gc&aacute;sanna iomad&uacute;la. Leagadh b&eacute;im ar an bhf&iacute;ric sin le cinneadh le d&eacute;ana&iacute; ag an gC&uacute;irt Achomhairc Choiri&uacute;il in DPP <i>v.</i> Peter Byrne. D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh deacrachta&iacute; praitici&uacute;la a bheith ag bhaint le teacht ar bhreithimh na C&uacute;irte D&uacute;iche lasmuigh de shu&iacute;onna c&uacute;irte. Th&aacute;inig a leith&eacute;id de dheacracht chun cinn le d&eacute;ana&iacute; i gc&aacute;s sa Ch&uacute;irt Uachtarach &mdash; Dylan Creavan <i>v.</i> CAB. B&rsquo;&eacute; breith na c&uacute;irte sa ch&aacute;s seo n&aacute; nach bhfuil breitheamh in ann bar&aacute;ntais a eisi&uacute;int m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; lasmuigh d&aacute; d(h)&uacute;iche. T&aacute;im ag moladh go r&eacute;iteofa&iacute; an fhadhb seo go reacht&uacute;il tr&iacute; leas&uacute; a thabharfaidh m&eacute; ar aghaidh chuig an Bille seo. Creidim go ndearbh&oacute;idh a leith&eacute;id de fhor&aacute;il, i dteannta an cinneadh soil&eacute;ir in DPP <i>v.</i> Byrne, n&aacute;d&uacute;r &eacute;igeand&aacute;la teoranta na for&aacute;la seo. T&aacute;im f&oacute;s den tuairim go bhfuil an fhor&aacute;il &eacute;igeand&aacute;la riachtanach chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; iomad&uacute;la a thagann chun cinn &oacute; am go ch&eacute;ile, san &aacute;it go bhf&eacute;adfadh fianaise g&eacute;ibheannach a bheith curtha ar ceal n&oacute; scriosta.</P>
      <P>Is &eacute; an phr&iacute;omh-&eacute;ifeacht d'alt 8 n&aacute; chun an uas-thr&eacute;imhse a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; le duine a choinne&aacute;il at&aacute; faoi amhras cion inghabh&aacute;la a dh&eacute;anamh, &oacute;n teorainn eiseach de 12 uair go 24 uair.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; roinnt fhor&aacute;lacha reacht&uacute;la ann a fhor&aacute;lfadh ar amhrastaigh a choinne&aacute;il. For&aacute;lann alt 30 den Acht um Chionta&iacute; in Aghaidh an St&aacute;it 1939 do dhuine gafa a choinne&aacute;il faoin alt sin suas go 48 uair faoi &uacute;dar&aacute;s na nGarda&iacute;. Leasaigh alt 10 den Acht um Chionta&iacute; in Aghaidh an St&aacute;it (Leas&uacute;) 1998 alt 30 den Acht 1939 chun fad&uacute; tr&eacute;imhse de 24 uair faoi &uacute;dar&aacute;s bhreithimh na C&uacute;irte D&uacute;iche a fhor&aacute;il. For&aacute;lann an tAcht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il (G&aacute;inne&aacute;il ar Dhruga&iacute;) 1996 do choinne&aacute;il suas go seacht l&aacute; do dhuine a gabhadh ar chion g&aacute;inne&aacute;il ar dhruga&iacute;, an ch&eacute;ad 48 uair faoi &uacute;dar&aacute;s na Garda&iacute; agus an fu&iacute;lleach faoi &uacute;dar&aacute;s bhreitheamh na C&uacute;irte D&uacute;iche. For&aacute;lann alt 4 den Acht um Cheartas Coiri&uacute;il 1984 do choinne&aacute;il 12 uair faoi &uacute;dar&aacute;s na Garda&iacute;.</P>
      <P>D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh forlu&iacute; idir na hAchtanna aimhrialtacht a chruth&uacute;.

She has just received a waste charges bill from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for &euro;350. The <Col N="1286"/>maximum waiver for which she will qualify is &euro;80, leaving her with a bill which is almost twice her weekly income. She cannot pay it, and there is no case to justify her having to pay it. She is not alone. There are many like her in every part of the country. Theirs is the need the Labour Party is highlighting with this motion tonight. Their need is urgent. They have waste charges bills they cannot afford to pay. In some cases they are facing imminent non-collection. In most cases they are worried sick about it. These people cannot be left waiting while political parties argue over the idea of charging for waste, or the role of waste charges in environmental taxation.</P>
      <P>The Government should introduce a national waiver scheme to address the financial hardship waste charges are now causing for low income households and families. The collection of domestic waste is now charged for in every part of the country, whether the local authority or a private operator provides the service. In preparation for this debate the Labour Party conducted a survey of the waste collection arrangements and charges in 30 of the larger local authorities. Although there are some similarities, the charging system is different in every one of the 30 local authorities surveyed.</P>
      <P>In some counties and towns there are still flat weekly, monthly or annual charges for collection of household waste. Some charge by the bag or bin, some charge by weight, and others have a combination of weight, volume and flat charging. The amounts charged per bag, per lift or per kilogram vary from one county or town to another. No two charging systems are the same.</P>
      <P>The stated annual amounts range from &euro;90 in County Leitrim to &euro;590 in County Mayo. The charge per bag ranges from &euro;3.50 in County Limerick to &euro;9 in County Donegal. It is difficult to estimate an average charge for areas which have a pay-by-weight system, but from the information supplied to the Labour Party the annual average appears to be around &euro;350 to &euro;400. The charges are higher than this in some areas.</P>
      <P>Some people in our society can pay &euro;350 or &euro;400 without even noticing it. The Labour Party does not subscribe to the argument that waste charges should be abolished for everyone, so that those who can manifestly afford to pay can benefit. Many in our country, including me, are prepared to pay a reasonable charge for the waste collection service. We ask only that the service is efficient and that recycling and recovery facilities are improved so that we can reduce the amounts of waste we generate.</P>
      <P>For many households and families the present level of charges is an unfair and unacceptable financial hardship. The sum of &euro;350 or &euro;400 represents more than two weeks income for a pensioner dependent on the non-contributory social welfare pension. That sum is up to &euro;70 more than the weekly income for a couple with four children where the breadwinner is ill and the family is dependent on the disability allowance. It represents between 50 and 60 hours of work for a <Col N="1287"/>worker on the national minimum wage of &euro;7 per hour and it is nearly twice the income threshold for a medical card for a couple which is currently &euro;222. It is also above the income limit at which a family begins to qualify for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>
      <P>Even by the restricted criteria used by the State for its various social welfare and supplementary welfare schemes, the current levels of domestic waste charges are unaffordable for low income households. However, these charges are demanded from them and their waste will not be collected if they cannot pay. That is the official position enshrined in legislation. Only a minority of low income households qualify at present for any kind of waiver for their waste charges.</P>
      <P>The survey undertaken by the Labour Party shows that in 21 of the 30 larger local authorities, private companies now collect domestic waste. In the vast majority of these areas, there is no waiver scheme at all. It is now the case in 18 of the 30 councils surveyed that the householder must pay up or keep his or her waste. The survey suggests that 60% of householders who cannot afford the waste charges have no access at all to a waiver scheme, even an inadequate one.</P>
      <P>In a small number of cases &mdash; three, according to the Labour Party survey &mdash; local authorities have made some arrangement with their private contractors for some kind of waiver. However, the legal basis for this appears to be in some doubt. At the end of last year the Attorney General wrote to the manager of Limerick City Council informing him that the continuation of the waiver system was illegal because the service there was private and not run by the council itself. That advice was subsequently amended and I understand there is now some court action in regard to the scheme in that area.</P>
      <P>Even where waiver schemes exist, and these are mostly in the one third of services still run by local authorities, the terms of the waivers are varied, inconsistent and in many cases inadequate. Some councils give waivers to old age pensioners but not to other social welfare recipients. In my constituency, the county manager has changed the waiver scheme so that only a small proportion of the charge is now waived. In none of the areas surveyed is there a waiver for households where the breadwinner is working and is on low income or where there are large family responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is proposing to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that the Government should introduce a national waiver scheme for waste charges that would apply uniformly across the country. The scheme could easily be administered through the social welfare system and through the tax system. The waste waiver could be added as an additional free scheme for pensioners. For others on social welfare and for pensioners who would not qualify for free schemes, the waiver could be paid as an additional payment like the living-alone allow<Col N="1288"/>ance or the fuel scheme. For workers on low incomes the waiver could come as a tax credit.</P>
      <P>The scheme should be designed to take into account the needs of differing family and household circumstances. A family with a large number of children would inevitably have more waste than a single-person household. Large families should not be financially penalised by higher levels of waste charge. Account should also be taken of households with special needs, such as a family member with a medical condition which might give rise to extra or heavier waste.</P>
      <P>There are several advantages to the introduction of a national waiver scheme along these lines. First, it can be done quickly and thereby provide immediate relief now to those whose needs are greatest, rather than obliging them to wait until all issues relating to waste charges and waste management are resolved. Second, it would be easy to administer and would reduce the cost in local authorities of having to duplicate means testing which existing waiver schemes require. Third, the Government could introduce the waiver scheme without having to unravel its current waste management strategy, even though the Labour Party believes there is a clear need to change the Government&rsquo;s approach to the waste issue. Fourth, the national waiver scheme would not be vulnerable to a challenge that it infringes European regulations on charging for waste since it is confined to the &ldquo;ability to pay&rdquo; principle. Finally and most importantly, a national waiver scheme would be fair and would at least ensure that the poorest households do not have to bear a disproportionate share of the country&rsquo;s waste problem.</P>
      <P>In any event, the Government has a particular responsibility to those who cannot afford to pay the current waste charges because it was the present Government which introduced these charges in their present form. The current waste charges arise directly from legislation which was introduced and argued for by the present Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government. The so-called Protection of the Environment Act 2003 was pushed and rushed through this House by former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen.</P>
      <P>The inappropriately-titled legislation, which should perhaps be better called &ldquo;Cullen&rsquo;s law&rdquo;, made five major changes. It removed from elected councillors the power to decide on waste charges and waiver schemes and it transferred that power to unelected city and county managers. Section 52(8) of the Act states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of any order made under any other enactment, the making of a charge in respect of the provision of a waste service and any exercise of the power of waiver under subsection (3) shall each be an executive function&rdquo;. As we all know, in local government, an executive function is performed by the manager, not by the elected council.</P>
      <P>Cullen&rsquo;s law prohibits elected councillors from having any hand, act or part in the making of <Col N="1289"/>waste charges or waiver schemes. Section 52(9) states: &ldquo;A local authority shall not by resolution under section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 give a direction or require any act, matter or thing to be done or effected, where the effect of such direction or requirement would be contrary to or inconsistent with this section and any such resolution purporting to be passed under the said section 140 which contravenes this subsection shall be void&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Cullen&rsquo;s law goes on to oblige county managers and other waste operators to charge the full economic cost of the waste service. Section 43 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 legally obliges the operators of landfill facilities to impose charges and makes it clear that they must charge the full economic cost. Section 43(4) states: &ldquo;The aggregate amount of charges imposed by the operator, in relation to the facility concerned, during the relevant period will be not less than the amount which would meet the total of the following costs (irrespective of whether these costs or any of them have been or will be met from any other financial measures available to the operator&rdquo;. The costs are then listed as: &ldquo;the acquisition and development of the facility&rdquo;; &ldquo;the operating costs&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the estimated costs for a period of 30 years after the closure of the facility of the costs of closure, restoration, remediation and after-care&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A financial resolution which the Government introduced in this House on 18 June 2003 and which, by a vote of 70 to 57, it insisted be passed without debate, gives the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the power to order charges for waste services. Cullen&rsquo;s Law also gives local authorities and other waste operators the power to refuse collection of waste from any householder who has not paid his or her charges.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to remind the House and the public of the provisions of Cullen&rsquo;s law of 2003 because since the last local elections, when Fianna F&aacute;il lost control of most councils, party members and some of their fellow travellers have been busily putting it about that the new waste charging regimes are the work of the Opposition parties which now hold the chairs of local authorities. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>Cullen&rsquo;s law gives the councillors no say whatever over waste charges, it gives the power to managers, it forces managers to charge the full economic cost and if any manager fails to do that, it gives the Minister the power to &ldquo;order&rdquo; the charges and anyone who does not pay the charges will not have his or her bin collected. When that legislation was moved in this House, it was vigorously opposed by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I encourage any person who is seriously interested in the politics of waste charges to read the D&aacute;il debates on this legislation. They are available on the Oireachtas website at <i>www.oireachtas.ie</i>. Second Stage debate was taken on 29 May and 13 and 17 June 2003, Committee Stage took place in the Select Committee on the Envir<Col N="1290"/>onment and Local Government on 19, 20, 24, and 25 June and Report Stage was taken on 1 July 2003.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party argued that the main purpose of the legislation was to increase waste charges to perhaps &euro;700 per annum. We are now well on the way to that figure. We also predicted that the waste charging regime being set up in Cullen&rsquo;s law would result in financial hardship for many households and an increase in illegal dumping and waste burning, and that there would be public health problems arising from uncollected waste. However, the proposals put forward by the Labour Party and other Opposition parties were voted down by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats majority in the House and in the committee.</P>
      <P>It is little comfort to us that we have been proved right in our predictions. However, we are determined to change Cullen&rsquo;s law when the Labour Party is returned to Government. In the meantime, our priority is with those who are on low incomes, whether from work, pensions or social welfare, and who are finding it extremely painful and sometimes impossible to pay the waste charges which were prescribed in Cullen&rsquo;s law.</P>
      <P>That is why the Labour Party proposes the national waiver scheme. I ask the Government, no matter how wedded it is to waste charges, to at least release those who cannot pay. I ask every Member of this House, no matter what his or her views on waste charges or waste management, to at least agree that those who are least able to pay should get some relief now and not have to wait until some undetermined time in the future.</P>
      <P>There are many households in this country which are struggling to get by, which the new economic fortunes have passed by and for which the waste charges represent a bill too far. Among them are people who have always paid their way and who worry about being in debt. These people need relief, and they need it soon. I ask the Government to agree to the Labour Party proposal for a national waiver scheme and I call on all Members of this House to support the Labour Party motion.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Ms Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise in support of the motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Gilmore. Anyone with an ear for accents and who listens to me will have no doubt as to where I am from; I am from Cork city. We do not distinguish between constituencies in Cork city except where we have to, and in this case I have to distinguish, I represent Cork North-Central. I suppose there is no-one in the country who does not know that Cork is designated European Capital of Culture for 2005. That is an honour of which the rest of the country should be proud and of which we in Cork are justifiably proud. We put much work into ensuring the city looked its best for the start of its year as European Capital of Culture. One can <Col N="1291"/>imagine our surprise when on 17 January, after discussions about illegal dumping and how we would manage to keep the city clean, a new regime &mdash; it is a regime &mdash; was introduced without consultation with councillors and without warning by a manager who does not have to stand for election and who does not have a great deal of contact with the ordinary Joe Soap in the street. He seems more content to meet the business community. I have to hand it to him. Cork is looking extremely well. What passed us by for years, the sort of development the rest of the country had, is beginning to happen in Cork.</P>
      <P>On 17 January, the manager in Cork introduced a new regime. From that day people were obliged to pay a flat waste collection charge of &euro;255 and after that a tag price of &euro;3, &euro;5 or &euro;7 per lift. That seems fairly reasonable until one considers that up to 17 January the charge was &euro;355 per year, which took in everything and included a very generous waiver scheme. That scheme was generous because councillors were in charge. They set the charge and determined the waiver scheme. Now it is set by someone who has very little contact with the ordinary public and who does not have to stand for election. As my colleague Deputy Gilmore said, he was given that power under legislation which was rushed through this House.</P>
      <P>From 17 January, bins were all of a sudden not being collected. The following week, rubbish from a household where the bin was not collected was simply put out beside the bin, and so it continued until there was a pyramid of rubbish. That occurred on virtually every street corner and worst of all right in front of Shandon. By means of the Internet and advertising around the world, Shandon is the symbol of the European Capital of Culture for 2005, yet that pyramid of rubbish was right in front of it. That was the photograph taken.</P>
      <P>There are people in Cork, as elsewhere in the country, who cannot afford the annual flat charge of &euro;255 plus the additional weekly tagging. The manager in Cork has decided that an old age pensioner on &euro;171 weekly will have the flat charge waived. However, a person perhaps next door, on disability benefit, less money than the old age pensioner gets, does not have the charge waived. That is why it is essential we have a national waiver scheme. In other areas of the country such as Naas, rubbish collection has been privatised by a council controlled by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats. In that case the manager has decided that because the scheme is privatised, there is no waiver scheme, nor will there be, even for pensioners, those on disability or people with big families and very low incomes. We cannot continue to say we have a policy on waste collection and waste management if at the same time we allow unelected members to introduce mechanisms which will ensure we will have continued uncollected dumping.</P><Col N="1292"/>
      <P>Last week and the week before I got legal advice on the manager&rsquo;s responsibility, an issue I raised at a committee meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I asked if, under the Waste Management Act, the manager was obliged to collect rubbish left for a period of time, and it seems he or she is not obliged to do so because of changes made in 2003 as a result of a Supreme Court decision. Under the Litter Act, however, the manager must collect that rubbish and pursue those who litter.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that when the Cork council manger finishes sifting through rubbish to find evidence of who left it, and a case eventually comes to court, the manager will find that most of the rubbish was put out for collection by people who could not afford either the flat fee or the tags. That is what we will find when such cases come to court. What position will the manager be in then, when the judge says certain people cannot afford to pay the charges, and the manger must collect the litter? The only solution to this problem is a national waiver scheme. I hope the Minister will listen to what we are saying and introduce such a scheme as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this simple, straightforward and humane Private Members&rsquo; motion from the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>The European Union directive published towards the end of 1996 was not acted on by the Government until 2000. The Government then panicked because it was going to fall victim to European Union criticism, so the directive was urgently implemented by all the local authorities countrywide. There was no national structure, guideline or model. Each local authority had to try to put together an individual structure in its own right. The local authorities, of which there are more than 40, came up with different models, costs, charges and methods of collection.</P>
      <P>In my area, covered by Dublin City Council, I have never had a wheelie-bin. I have a plastic bag but cannot get a wheelie-bin whether I like it or not because I live more or less between the canals. Major sections of that area, particularly south of the North Circular Road, are not allowed wheelie-bins. What am I to do in those circumstances? What are people in those areas to do when they see a new charge imposed on them without any additional service? They do not view this as a particularly forward-looking approach to waste management.</P>
      <P>At the same time as having this mishmash and hodgepodge of waste management charges and collections in every local authority, nothing was done by the Government to deal with the principle enunciated by the European Union, namely that the polluter pays. As we all know, the vast majority of waste comes from the industry sector. It comes from building rubble, from certain undesirable farming methods and from excessive manufacturing packaging. The Government has done nothing about that. I hope the Minister <Col N="1293"/>decides to impose the same type of penalties in this regard as on the compliant domestic householder.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Gilmore outlined, Deputy Cullen, when Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, compounded the situation in 2003 by shifting not only the responsibility but also the right to levy a charge from the local elected representatives to the city manager. The operation of the full whack of the charges from January of this year has been an absolute mess. No proper preparation has taken place, particularly with regard to waivers. There were no waivers ready. An Post had not got them from the local authorities in order to send them out to those entitled to them. I spend half my time on the telephone contacting the waste management section of Dublin City Council to tell them that six weeks after the system has been put in place, certain people have not got the waivers to which they are entitled. The answer given is that those involved are trying to process matters. All the processing should have been done prior to the implementation of the schedules but it was not. I have been told that in many cases, certain pensioners, the unemployed or those on disability benefit will not get their waivers until April. In the meantime, they must go and purchase tags. One can only buy them in bunches of three rather than individually, and people are told they will not be refunded. Those people are entitled to a waiver in the first place because of the lack of preparation and the totally unorthodox way in which the whole system was put in place. The result is a great deal of illegal dumping in Dublin Central, my constituency and that of the Taoiseach. Tags are being stolen from plastic bags. People who are not putting their waste into bins are taking plastic bags and dumping them in an area where uplift is by plastic bag only. Great abuse of the system is taking place. Health and safety issues are not being dealt with, and of course, even the most compliant taxpayers and householders are extremely annoyed and angry with the manner in which the scheme has been implemented, with the result that there is support for anyone who does not wish to be compliant. A sense of grievance is abroad because of the total mismanagement of the system.</P>
      <P>At least regarding waivers we should have some uniformity or national system whereby the most vulnerable, pensioners, the disabled, the unemployed and those at the lower end of the scale who are entitled to a fair crack of the whip get that. We must do it through a national scheme rather than willy-nilly, which seems to be the only way we are able to do business in this country. The Minister and Government should have examined the issue of incentives. Surely anyone in his or her right mind would start off not with a levy but with powerful recycling incentives. One does not start with a stick but with a carrot, but that has certainly not happened in this case.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1294"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>As pointed out by other speakers, there is a great need for a national waiver scheme. There is no consistency in the effort. Before I come to my point, I wish to say two things. If one looks in the Gallery, one sees that there is no one from the press to report what is happening in this House. That is the issue, and that is why the Labour Party is the authentic voice of the people. I hope that is conveyed.</P>
      <P>I was a member of a local authority for many years. The Minister should note that the Government gave local authorities a rate support grant. It changed it in later years to a &ldquo;local government bond&rdquo;. That is only about 40% of what the Government should be giving the councils. The local manager of Cork County Council said he did not have the finances to give people the waivers it is required to grant because the Government has withheld from the local authority the funding it committed itself to provide in the first instance. For the disposal of refuse to be carried out in an equitable fashion and in line with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle, local authorities must move towards a waiver system without a standing charge. That has become a big issue in my area, and I am quite sure it is the same in many other areas.</P>
      <P>People bought their tags when they could afford to buy them, but now they must pay an overhead charge as well as what they pay under the pay by weight system. That is not on, and that is why I am quite sure this motion will have the support of other parties in the House. Since the inception of the pay by weight system in County Cork in 2004, Cork County Council has insisted on a standing charge as well as one for every kilogram of waste disposed of. That is contrary to the polluter pays principle, as it penalises the householder who endeavours to recycle. The person recycling pays a standing charge as well as the person who does not do so, and the effect is that the former subsidises the latter.</P>
      <P>The most equitable system is one based on weight. That allows the householder to be charged only for what is being disposed of. It facilitates smaller households, especially those consisting of pensioners who do not qualify for waivers. If local authorities were serious about the polluter pays principle, the instigation of a refuse charge based only on weight would encourage each individual to recycle more without penalising those who up to now have endeavoured to recycle most of their waste.</P>
      <P>In the absence of any clear policy in town councils on recycling, the introduction of kerbside collection of dry recyclables must be considered. Local authorities, to keep landfill costs down, must endeavour to give householders the opportunity to recycle waste. Such a policy would be suitable for elderly people in particular who do not have the means to drive to a civic amenity or bring site. This has been mentioned many times by different speakers. It was Fianna F&aacute;il which pressed the button and brought in the system now being imposed on people. It brought in the <Col N="1295"/>service charges with which we now have to contend. The way in which Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Deputies decided in 2003 to transfer responsibility for setting waste charges from elected councillors to local authority managers has led to a significant increase in charges, resulting in financial difficulties for pensioners and families on low incomes. That must be changed, and the only way to do so is to adopt this motion and introduce a proper system giving consideration to those people who depend on an equitable system for the disposal of waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make a brief contribution in support of this motion. In the context of this debate, both in the House and throughout the country, we need a little honesty if at all possible. The reality is very clear. The Government introduced the legislation in 2003 that took the power to set charges from elected members and gave it to an unelected person, the county manager. In my county council area, the vast majority of people have come to a realisation that, in the context of waste charges, they are prepared to make a contribution. However, they will not be taken for granted.</P>
      <P>One of the great problems in this regard is that we will get a situation where the county manager, with the power granted him by the Government, will embark on massive increases in charges of 20%, 30% or 40% annually. That will not be accepted by the electorate. Regarding a uniform waiver system, in Fingal we have a system that works very well. If one does not pay tax, one is entitled to a waiver. In general, that is relatively fair. It can be examined and amended but a major problem is the lack of uniformity throughout the country, particularly in areas where Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats have a majority &mdash; they do not have a majority now so I hope it will not happen &mdash; in that their priority is privatisation. When privatisation takes place, there is no mechanism at local or national level for a waiver. The Minister has the support of the working people to introduce a fair waiver system. The case for such a system is clear. With this motion the Minister has the support of the Labour Party and the other Members of this House. The Minister should deliver on it.</P>

      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(i) notes:</P>
      <P LI="3" FLI="0">that the operational details of waste management services have never been the responsibility of central Government;</P>
      <P LI="3" FLI="0">that local authorities have received record levels of discretionary general purpose <Col N="1296"/>grants from the local government fund in the current year;</P>
      <P LI="3" FLI="0">the very significant investment which has been made by the Government in developing modern integrated waste management infrastructure and services;</P>
      <P LI="3" FLI="0">that the costs of maintaining these services must be met;</P>
      <P LI="3" FLI="0">that many local authorities have availed of the existing statutory provisions which allow for the operation of waste waiver schemes; and</P>

      <P LI="2">(ii) supports the continuing discussions within the social partnership process which seek to identify and address any inequitable impact which the charging system may place on the disadvantaged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">I listened with great interest to the debate. Waste services are perhaps the most quintessentially local of all services. They have never been administered nationally; they have always been determined locally. When the then Labour Party leader, Dick Spring, introduced the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill in 1983, he touched, wisely in my view, on this issue. Speaking in regard to the application of local charges, the then Minister said: &ldquo;There is no good reason why charges should be fixed centrally.&rdquo; The then Minister went on to say that discretion should reside with local authorities and be determined so that &ldquo;account can be taken of what is needed, and what is fair and reasonable, and also of the best means of applying the powers in the local circumstances&rdquo;. At that time the Minister clearly envisaged that different service charges would be raised by different local authorities as was appropriate in their individual circumstances. The then Minister went on to discuss the general issue of waivers or the mitigation of charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy will hold on for a second, I will bring him up to date. I am giving him a history lesson because he spoke about honesty, but it might not be a bad idea if he applied a little honesty.</P>

	<P>The Minister is bereft of ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The then Minister, former Deputy Spring, went on to discuss the general issue of waivers or the mitigation of charges. He made the point that the Bill did not attempt to &ldquo;define the grounds&rdquo; where waivers would apply or &ldquo;to restrict the exercise of this power&rdquo; as this was an area where the decisions might best be based on local knowledge or experience. The Minister&rsquo;s views are as valid today as they were in 1983.</P><Col N="1297"/>
      <P>Indeed, the Minister, when he held this portfolio, was so convinced that local services and the associated charges should be determined locally that he provided in the 1983 Act that centrally imposed statutory restrictions on the level of charges should be removed. In short, the Minister, in the 1983 Act, which was the basis for introducing service charging for water, waste and other services, provided that the issues regarding the non-payment of service charges were a matter for local determination and decidedly not a matter in which the Minister of the day should interfere.</P>
      <P>There was much wisdom in the then Minister&rsquo;s contribution, so much so that 13 years later another Labour Party Minister for the Environment returned to the theme.</P>

	<P>I repeat, there was so much wisdom in the contribution of the then Minister, Dick Spring, who was a good friend of Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s at the time, that his wisdom was returned to 13 years later by yet another Labour Party Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin. In his programme, Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change, the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, recognised the commendable clarity that locally determined charges for domestic refuse collection were &ldquo;an appropriate instrument in waste management policy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The waste management policies in place today are directly built on the policies foreseen in the policy document, Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change, by the then Minister, Deputy Howlin. More importantly, that provided the basic foundation on which the Waste Management Act 1996 was steered through the Houses of the Oireachtas by none other than the then Minister, Deputy Howlin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should give us some of his own ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Tonight&rsquo;s debate is about a fundamental principle, the principle of subsidiarity. It <Col N="1298"/>is a debate about whether local government should be allowed to decide how local services are to be delivered, taking into account local needs and conditions, or whether we should instead look to micro-management by the Minister of the day of these essentially local services.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way in the past eight years in terms of an integrated waste management strategy. The issue of waste charges is a central element in any sustainable waste management policy. Ireland is following an approach adopted by best practice in Europe. The comprehensive policy framework for modernising our approach to waste management was put in place in the 1998 document, Waste Management: Changing our Ways. That policy approach is centred on the integrated waste management approach based on the internationally adopted hierarchy of waste options.</P>
      <P>The policy context was strengthened in 2002 with the publication of Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change. These policy statements will remain the bedrock of waste management policy in Ireland in the coming period. They are designed to achieve, by 2013, the ambitious targets set out in Waste Management: Changing Our Ways, which include recycling of 35% of municipal waste and recycling of at least 50% of C and D waste. Waste Management &mdash; Changing our Ways also set a number of complementary targets aimed at increasing recycling rates, including, for example, a diversion of 50% of household waste from landfill, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill, and the development of composting and other biological treatment facilities. I make these points because these services cost money.</P>
      <P>Progress towards these targets has been very encouraging. In its national waste database report for 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that only 9% of municipal waste was recovered for recycling that year. The figure for 2003 is 28%. The recovery rate of packaging waste is estimated to have increased from 15% in 1998 to 42% in 2003.</P>
      <P>All the indications are that the recycling position has improved even further with the progressive roll-out of two-bin or dual-bin collections. Dual-bin collection is now available to 560,000 households, approximately 42% of all households nationally, and there is the continued expansion of the bring bank network. Over 1,800 bring banks are currently in place compared with 850 only six years ago. The increased network of civic amenity recycling centres is now another reality.</P>
      <P>The expansion in the waste recycling infrastructure has been assisted by significant funding provided to local authorities from the environment fund. A capital grants scheme established in 2002 has provided &euro;50 million so far for 90 projects. However, all this notable development comes at a price. The scale of investment is reflected in the charges which need to be levied by both public and private sector operators. That our waste management costs should be met in this <Col N="1299"/>way has been the policy of successive Governments. I recall that Deputy Howlin, when Minister for the Environment, made the point in the document, Better Local Government, that &ldquo;Unlike charges for domestic water supply and sewerage facilities, charges for domestic refuse collection can be related to usage, and will be an important instrument in waste management policy&rdquo;. Deputy Howlin was correct. The move to pay-by-use charging now being implemented flows directly from that statement. It is dishonest to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>The setting of such waste charges is a matter for the individual local authorities or private operators. The polluter pays principle, which is espoused by so many Members, advocates that the cost of managing waste is met by those who generate it. As in many cases, the reality is that what is preached here is quite often not practised at local level. Historically a system of flat rate charging applied in most local authorities. The switch to use-based charges will reward those who generate least waste and who are most active in recycling. Deputy Gilmore, when appearing on RTE recently, accepted that pay-by-use waste charges are an equitable method of charging for waste services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Was that the programme for which the Minister failed to appear?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy heard wrong. He has selective hearing.</P>
      <P>The objective of pay-by-use charging is environmental in its focus and it encourages recycling. The less waste produced, the lower the charge. The precise charging mechanism in any given area will inevitably be fitted to local circumstances, costs and available technology. I note, for example, that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, on the basis of a motion supported by former Labour Party Minister Niamh Bhreathnach, has opted for a quite sophisticated system with standing and lift charging components and a weight-based element.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is worth recalling that the service provided in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is not in the hands of a private operator, it is in the hands of the council which is dominated by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. I understand the Labour Party changed its long-standing view on the issue of service charging and on that of waivers. Perhaps Deputy Gilmore would like to inform the House of his record in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>My record is absolutely consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

	<P>The Minister, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Others have opted for a combination of a standing charge and a charge per lift, while the humble prepaid tag also has its place.</P>
      <P>The point must be accepted that waste charges generally have increased in line with the exponential increase in the cost of waste management. We have moved from a position where we relied on a large number of poorly managed landfills to one where we are rapidly putting in place modern waste management infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Each individual local authority has the power, where it is the service provider, to make a waiver scheme or to make appropriate arrangements with the private sector, where it is not. In this way local solutions can be tailored to local circumstances with proper application of the subsidiarity principle. In this regard, I again remind the <Col N="1301"/>House of the sentiments of the then Minister, Dick Spring, in 1983 in proposing a legislative basis for waiver type schemes. He explained that &ldquo;decisions must be made on the basis of local knowledge and experience&rdquo;. I fully concur with this view. Local authorities are best placed to decide what is needed to address the differing circumstances that present to them. What is more, they now have the resources to allow them to do so.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are now in a far better financial position than they have been for many decades. This is due in large part to the establishment by this Government of the local government fund. For 2005, I was glad to be in a position to notify local authorities of record levels of general purpose grants from the fund. This year, these discretionary block grants, which authorities can use as they see fit, will amount to a staggering &euro;817 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact is that the Minister is not telling the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This represents an increase of over 9% on 2004, which far exceeds the rate of inflation. It is almost 2.5 times the level of funding provided in 1997, when the parties opposite were in Government. In anyone&rsquo;s language, this represents a tremendous boost for local government and it enhances the ability of local authorities to provide quality services, including the operation of appropriate waiver schemes to their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is misleading the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Repeating the mantra is not in any way to deflect from the truth. The relevant figures are those I have placed before the House.</P>
      <P>In practice, waiver schemes are generally available where a local authority provides the service directly. In general, where services are provided by private collectors, local authorities have not considered it necessary to put any supplementary arrangement in place. There are, however, a number of limited exceptions. Local authorities have the power, in existing provisions, to make special arrangements in the case of hardship if they consider it necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>The motion tabled by the Labour Party calls on the Government to introduce a uniform national waiver scheme, irrespective of circumstances, across the board. It will be clear from what I have said that this approach would be fundamentally in conflict with the thinking of successive Ministers for the Environment, including those who served with distinction from Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s party. I do not believe it would be wise to simply reverse all of that which has gone before.</P>
      <P>I made previous reference in the House to the discussions currently taking place between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and which follow on from dis<Col N="1302"/>cussions with the social partners in the context of the implementation of Sustaining Progress. The purpose of these discussions is to consider whether there is a role for some supplemental arrangement to address any cases of real hardship which may arise as a result of waste charges and which are not addressed by local waiver schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is coming to it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect these discussions to conclude shortly.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a further point, which I think is appropriate in the context of this debate, about the private sector and the way it has operated. In recent years we have witnessed the emergence of an extensive and vibrant private waste management industry working alongside local authorities. This is to be welcomed but it brings new issues to the surface. I am determined to ensure that equity and best practice prevail in the delivery of all waste management services. In this regard, I am unhappy at an apparent lack of flexibility and customer response in the case of some private operators. In cases which have come to my attention, customers feel that their complaints are being ignored, that operators are too inflexible or that they adopt a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude to complaints. This is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Waste management is unique among the commercially provided public utilities in not having a regulator. Regulators were put in place in telecommunications, electricity and gas. When the Waste Management Act 1996 was introduced, no consideration appears to have been given to appointing a regulator. I do not say this to fault the author of the legislation. The concept of regulation was novel at that stage and private sector provision of waste services was in its infancy. All of that has dramatically changed and I am giving consideration to the additional regulatory arrangements that may be necessary to ensure price competition, best practice, good customer service and to guard against monopolistic practices, whether by local authorities or private operators. This will ensure that those paying waste charges can be confident of getting value for money.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that it has never been, nor should it be, the practice for central Government to determine operational matters in regard to waste management. Waste management is one of the oldest services provided by local authorities. Working to national and European Union environmental standards, local authorities should be free to tailor services to local needs. The Labour Party motion would involve an unacceptable degree of interference with this principle which, as already stated, has been articulated by successive Ministers for the Environment, including those from the Deputy&rsquo;s party.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore represents D&uacute;n Laoghaire. The new waste charges in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council were passed without debate last month.</P>

	<P>The Deputy should mention it to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>A 50% waiver might be considered for householders living alone or with dependants, in receipt of one of the following payments: a non-contributory old age pension; blind pension; unemployment assistance. The following persons could qualify for a 50% waiver: householders in receipt of family income supplement; householders who possess a medical <Col N="1304"/>card; or householders in receipt of a small occupational pension. The following persons should qualify for a further 50% waiver, which effectively means a complete waiver: any householder who qualifies for a 50% waiver and who is in receipt of a living alone allowance. To any objective observer that seems to be a generous enough scheme. This was the very proposal Labour Party councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown voted against in 1999 and in 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>They had no say in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

	<P>The Deputy should hang on a second. I have a short period in which to make my points. If they do not suit the Deputy, he can reply to them tomorrow when he is winding up the debate.</P>
      <P>This was a waiver scheme in the context of a publicly delivered waste management scheme by the staff of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in the context of an overall charge of £150 at the time. The Labour Party councillors voted against this. Now they are trying to go back into history and return to the stage when this type of proposal was before them. It is somewhat rich for them to say now that they would love to see this being reintroduced, when they did not have the courage to vote for what they knew to be commonsense, fair and equitable at that time. The irony was that the principle of it had been introduced by one of their own in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1996. It is all very well to introduce legislation with all the fine words and great intentions when one cannot deliver on the ground. That was the constant theme of the Labour Party councillors&rsquo; behaviour in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in the period 1999-2004.</P>
      <P>The next thing that happened was Labour ascended to the chairmanship of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown. On 11 January 2005 a number of resolutions were passed. Among them was a requirement that the Government introduce the waiver scheme. There was nothing concrete in this, just a general idea that the Government should introduce a waiver scheme. Also, every Labour and Fine Gael councillor supported the passing of the resolution. A sophisticated electorate will consider that these parties&rsquo; disavowal of this vote rings hollow. Nobody will believe that on the one hand Labour was against the waiver in 1999-2001 etc. and only voted in favour of all of these measures in 2005 because somebody put a gun to their head. It is also disappointing that in all that period so much progress has been made with waste management in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, with the introduction of bring centres, the green and grey <Col N="1305"/>bins, waste packaging regulations and progress has been made within the green business network and on every step of the way the Labour Party refused to vote in favour of any of these measures. It is no use re-writing history and seeking to go back in time. Matters have changed and people will not believe there is any sincerity in this motion.</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy know what is happening in the city of Cork? Has he been in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I have listened to a great deal of nonsense from that side of the House with regard to waste management. The vast majority of people in Cork city pay their service charges. For years Members opposite opposed every opportunity to bring forward an equitable system. It took Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and some other members of Cork Corporation to make bold decisions with regard to the introduction of a liberal waiver system. The figures show that one third of all waivers nationally were delivered by Cork City Council, so there is an opportunity for local authorities to be flexible in their approach to refuse charges.</P>
      <P>The people of Cork have responded tremendously to the system introduced. A handful of people are actively discouraging others from co-operating with the system passed by Cork City Council. Many people are recycling their waste, paying their service charges and are quite willing to do so. However, a handful of people are intent on disruption and seeking to bring about what must be considered to be a state of civil disobedience in opposing this measure. I do not mind someone highlighting his or her opinions in a chamber, but it is not acceptable to encourage people to dump rubbish on the public highways of Cork city. I would like councillors to condemn this publicly.</P>
      <P>On the question of waste management, there is no doubt that in recent years people have responded. We could not have continued as we were. Cork City Council has taken the lead in this regard and been proactive in ensuring there are proper waste management facilities, bring centres and civic amenities. However, we have a long way to go and I accept that. In recent years, though, tremendous steps have been taken nationally, as well. In 1999 9% of all municipal waste was recycled. The figure is now almost 30% and I am sure that when the figures are published for this year, after the introduction of this system, there <Col N="1306"/>will be a dramatic increase in recyclable waste usage in--&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock"><NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
	<P>How come people from Cork city come to north Cork to dispose of their waste?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>That is Deputy Sherlock&rsquo;s problem, not in my backyard, NIMBY. He has been saying that all his life. However, there is the greater good to be considered as well. Perhaps he should start acting in that system as well.</P>
      <P>On bring sites, I acknowledge great advances have been made. However, we need to be proactive in ensuring that the bring sites are monitored and cleaned up on a regular basis. That is one area in which major advances must be made. In my constituency there was a case recently where the bring sites were not emptied over the Christmas period. People who had brought their bottles, cardboard, plastics and papers with the best intentions, were left with no choice but to take them home again over the Christmas period. That is an area in which we will have to move to ensure that there is a, more than adequate, supply of bring sites and always more space to cater for the volume of recyclable waste.</P>
      <P>In general, this motion highlights the hypocrisy of the Labour Party as regards waste management and trying to bring about a fair and equitable system. If Labour Deputies were responsible they would visit the city council in Cork where there is a generous waiver system in place. A person in receipt of an old age pension does not pay the charge. However, we have ensured that those who can afford to pay will do so and those who cannot will not. That is a very equitable system. The Labour Party should actively encourage waste management charges for those who can afford to pay, so that we can assist those who cannot pay. By its continued opposition down through the years, it has forced many civic minded people to dig deep into their pockets.</P>

In my town, all the parties <Col N="1307"/>got together and dealt with the issue at a local level, as a community should do. However, there were hard men outside the door. One night, they burst in during a debate. The mayor, a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il party, was wearing a yellow shirt and tie and he was accused of being an Orangeman. I think the protest was led by Sinn F&eacute;in that night. There were marches on our streets, with hundreds of people giving out about it. Eventually, logic won out. The logic is that we must have a waste management strategy and that everyone should pay according to their means. When a system exists where someone only pays for putting out the bin, senior citizens reduce their use. They are the best at recycling in Drogheda today, with many of them putting out the bin once every six weeks. They are very happy to do that.</P>
      <P>The problem arises with large families or where many people are living in a home. Many people in that situation and those on low incomes cannot afford to pay. If one cannot afford to pay, there should be a system in place to deal with that. It is a tenet of Progressive Democrats policy and it is something on which we all agree. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to that in his statement. I ask the Minister of State to write to all local councils to state what the Minister actually said, which is that where the service is privatised, the local authority can make an arrangement with the service provider to have a waiver system. Many councils are not aware of that. If that is clarified, it could make a significant difference on how councillors view the issue. I think it was in Limerick that the opposite view was expressed by senior counsel.</P>
      <P>I also want to address the question of a regulator. The Minister spoke about bringing in a regulator to regulate the price of refuse charges. I would not be happy about that as I believe the best regulator is competition. If a company has a monopoly it will apply to the regulator and will get its price increase. The perception is that the regulator gives price increases which consumers do not believe necessary. A regulator for refuse charges is a bad idea. We should encourage more competition and more privatisation.</P>
      <P>Illegal dumping has been mentioned and we are aware of a national strategy on it. One of the problems is that the EPA, which has much responsibility for our waste management and for the enforcement of illegal dumping regulations, is not accountable to the D&aacute;il. We need to make the EPA accountable to the D&aacute;il. We can bring representatives of the EPA before a D&aacute;il committee, but they seem to be a law unto themselves. The EPA can also do what it likes in regard to the issue of the incinerator in Cork. It does not need to have regard to public opinion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. The problem of waste, waste charges and the application of the waiver scheme is always contentious. The issue of waivers con<Col N="1308"/>cerns me particularly with respect to the financial difficulties waste charges can create for pensioners and others on low incomes. As usual, this comes back to an issue of fairness. I accept we cannot continue to produce waste without covering the costs of dealing with it. We cannot continue to bury or export our waste. Recycling and re-use is the way forward. The polluter must pay and many cases have been highlighted tonight where people are known to dump rubbish. With the advent of charges for waste, some people have a tendency to go to the countryside to dump their rubbish. That is happening on a far too regular basis and it must be condemned. We should be far more severe on people who carry out such scandalous activity.</P>
      <P>Bring banks and bottle banks have proved very successful. Some local authorities have dumps overflowing with bottles, clothes, papers and so on. Local authorities should be to the forefront in setting an example for the community. There is a realisation across the country that we want to keep our environment clean. In South Tipperary County Council, we have run a tidy schools competition. There is a special prize-giving day which is extremely successful. It sends out the right message to young people, who look forward to the day when their school can receive a small token of appreciation for being kept tidy. This creates a healthy environment for our younger people and is something that should also be encouraged nationally by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The theory that the polluter must pay, like all good progressive tax systems, must be based on the ability to pay. Large families, the sick and the elderly sometime struggle to pay waste charges and we cannot ignore them. There is a problem when the service is provided by operators and people in vulnerable situations cannot avail of such private operators. It is very unfair that they have to pay the full amount and we need to tackle that. If this motion does nothing else tonight it should highlight that situation. We need to look after the old and vulnerable people who looked after the environment in more difficult times. I fully support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>We are debating the principle that the polluter pays. We all accept this principle, but there is such a range of operators and charges throughout the country that there is a great variation in the existence and type of waiver system. The key concern is that the polluter-pays principle fails to take into account the ability to pay the charge with resulting difficulties for low-income households. This has been especially true in recent years as charges have increased dramatically.</P>
      <P>There are currently two methods to reduce refuse charges. These are tax relief provided by the State and waivers or partial waivers provided by local authorities. The waivers depend on each local authority as no national guidelines have been set out by the Department of the Envir<Col N="1309"/>onment, Heritage and Local Government. An example of this farce exists in my constituency at Baylough on the Roscommon-Westmeath border. As the white line down the middle of the road through the village is the county boundary, older people or those on the minimum wage on the right hand side are entitled to a waiver while those on the left are not. There is no assistance of any kind for refuse charges for those on the left. On the left hand side of the road, the charge for refuse collection by a private contractor is approximately &euro;100 per annum more expensive than on the right hand side where the waiver system is already in place.</P>
      <P>There is no waiver scheme in place in my county because the collection of refuse was privatised in the late 1980s or early 1990s. The current charge for refuse collection is approximately &euro;368. This flat-rate charge is one of the highest in the country and does not take into consideration people who recycle their refuse. Private contractors have approached Roscommon and Galway County Councils on a number of occasions to discuss the introduction of a waiver, but no assistance has been forthcoming. The local authority in Roscommon claims it does not have available to it the resources to fund a waiver. The authority has focused on the area of hardship and contends the matter should be addressed by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. When one contacts that Department or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the buck is passed back to local authorities. The Minister of State has done that again this evening. I note that last year in Sligo, the manager of the borough council stated that it was illegal to introduce a waiver scheme. There appears to be a great deal of ambiguity on the matter.</P>
      <P>While the State makes support available through tax relief, it is only beneficial to those in employment who pay income tax. Those who rely solely on social welfare payments cannot benefit. While those who have an income receive a 20% discount, those who cannot afford the charge, such as pensioners, get nothing. In other words, the most vulnerable in society receive no assistance from the Government. People in low-paid employment may not be entitled to tax relief due to their low level of income. We must put in place <?oasys _dc28-?>a similar system to the one which exists to provide mortgage relief and VHI cover whereby tax relief is applied at source. Such a system would also benefit the self-employed who must currently wait for up to two years to obtain the relief.<?oasys _dc0-?></P>
      <P>We must put in place a sensible national waiver scheme and establish a decent level of recycling facilities. Facilities to recycle are not widely available, especially for people in isolated rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. As one who lives in a Border area, I am more aware of illegal dumping than anything else. While the activity is <Col N="1310"/>not relevant to the Bill, I mention it in passing. I raised in the D&aacute;il the other day the fact that last week illegal dumping of oil waste took place in Monaghan once again. This cost Monaghan County Council &euro;500,000 in 2004 and is potentially lethal.</P>
      <P>The waiver system is not available in Monaghan though there is a relief system from which it is extremely difficult to benefit. I pay tribute to McElvaney Waste and Recycling Service which introduced the first weigh-in system in Ireland. The company belongs to my Fine Gael colleague, Councillor Hugh McElvaney. The year before the company introduced the system each customer produced 1.25 tonnes of waste. After one year, that was down to less than 0.75 tonnes, a 40% reduction. Of that reduction, 55% was related to blue bin, or kerb-side collections while some went to home composting. The cost to the consumer was reduced considerably as customers paid only for what waste had to be collected. The county manager in Monaghan introduced a charge for 2004 of &euro;125 per tonne, but competition from landfills in Cavan and Louth forced a reduction to &euro;115 per tonne in 2005. I question the need for a regulator when open competition is so effective.</P>
      <P>The waiver system is important. The special hardship scheme has not worked in my county. Only last night a constituent called me and was crying because she had no idea if the scheme would apply to her. She said she lay awake at night worrying about the cost of waste. That is not what we want and it is not characteristic of a fair community. Waste charges should be realistic.</P>
      <P>I support the comments of Deputy Hayes regarding teaching about waste in schools. We have the same programme in Monaghan where it is wonderful to see schools bringing ideas home to people and encouraging them to recycle. The rate of increase in the number of bottle banks in County Monaghan, which is the highest in the country, demonstrates how teaching can be of benefit in the context of recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>I come from Westport which is one of the tidiest towns in Ireland and has won the tidy towns competition on many occasions. It came second last year in the overall competition and was deemed Ireland&rsquo;s tidiest large town.</P>
      <P>The issue tonight is not about waste, however, it is about who can afford to pay for a refuse service. I have a suggestion for the Government. I thought it had developed a new social conscience when it went to Cork and Father Healy came to talk to its members. In the recent budget, the Government lectured the House and told us there was a new socialist party in the country. While the Government says it has moved over with the Labour Party, it has failed to prove as much in its actions. Pensioners earn &euro;179 per week but the cheapest refuse service in Westport is &euro;300. While there is a 50% waiver for pensioners, it is not right that they must still put aside a full week&rsquo;s <Col N="1311"/>pension to pay for a refuse service. The issue is not one of keeping towns, villages or the country clean, it is one of fairness.</P>
      <P>We have free schemes for fuel, electricity supply and telephone services. Any elderly person benefiting from a free scheme should have his or her refuse collected for free whether it is by the public or private sector. I heard Deputy Crawford refer to local authorities. Some are good and do their best to promote the environment and provide bins and bottle banks while others make no effort. The latter authorities are delighted to have as much refuse to collect as possible to allow them to earn more revenue. While they tell us it costs a great deal to collect refuse, who monitors their claims? Refuse collection has been the greatest money-making racket for local authorities across the country. They never had as much money and never found it as easy to collect. In this context, it is wrong to penalise people on pensions.</P>
      <P>A waiver scheme should be introduced which functions like the free schemes to provide free refuse collection to pensioners. They are the people who put this country where it is today. How can a person on &euro;179 per week be expected to put money aside to pay heavy refuse charges to local authorities? We must be realistic and fair to protect the vulnerable people in society. We must not talk about it, but take action. Local authorities do not care about the elderly or anyone else as long as they get their money. When the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, spoke about all the money he gave local authorities this year, he failed to tell the House that most of it will, among other things, be absorbed by inflation and used to pay for benchmarking.</P>

	<P>I asked for this debate on foot of last week&rsquo;s revelations regarding the variation in cost of storage of electronic voting machines. It costs in excess of &euro;658,000 per annum to store the machines throughout the country. That was all very well, until Deputy McGrath discovered there is a difference in a variety of costing depending on the county in which the ballot box is situated. In some places the costs are exorbitant, in other places they are not so much so. Top of the list are counties Sligo and Leitrim where there is zero cost for storage and insurance of the machines. This is very welcome. In County Louth, the storage cost is less than &euro;2 per ballot box, while in County Waterford it costs over &euro;271 per machine per annum. That is unacceptable and there is great public concern regarding this issue.</P><Col N="1312"/>
        <P>We heard that a returning officer, I think in County Dublin, has billed the State for tens of thousands of euro for the storage of these machines &mdash; this returning officer happens to be in partnership with his daughter. That is not acceptable. It is similar to a county manager contracting labour into his workforce. One cannot be a manager and at the same time supply services. That is the kernel of the issue.</P>
        <P>Deputy McGrath has done much work with regard to the issue. He wrote to the returning officers throughout the country and received an answer from one of them today. The Deputy cannot be here this evening and he asked me to relay this. The reply states that the Deputy&rsquo;s letter has been passed on to the organisation which represents returning officers in the State. In other words, there is no transparency and openness from the individual returning officer to whom he sent the letter.</P>
        <P>We need accountability and transparency with regard to this issue. Serious questions arise. If the legislation regarding standards and ethics in public office does not cover this situation, perhaps it ought to be looked into by this House to ensure greater transparency and openness surrounding such matters.</P>
        <P>This issue must be investigated fully. All the facts of how and why there is yet another problem with the how the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government handles the issue of electronic voting machines must be known. I am amazed at the Department&rsquo;s brass neck in informing Deputy McGrath that it did not seek detailed information on ownership of premises used by returning officers for storage purposes and does not have this information on a comprehensive basis. Surely if the returning officers worked in partnership with local councils, they would be able to find a place that would meet the requirements of the machines and would store them much cheaper and effectively.</P>
        <P>The Minister should outline for the House exactly what the Department and the Government intend to do with regard to the matter. Is the Minister comfortable with the practice of allowing council officials store these machines in property that they own? Why is there no central storage facility for the machines that could save taxpayers&rsquo; money? Will the Government commit to progress in this regard? Does the Minister believe the current raft of ethics legislation, which seemingly does not cover this area, might be in need of upgrading?</P>
        <P>This is another body blow for the electronic voting project. Apart from the lack of a verifiable voter audit trail, there is a lack of public faith in the system and a lack of clear direction from the Department. Again, we have a complete lack of transparency with regard to the issue. People are most amazed and concerned about the absolute waste of public money and lack of transparency and openness surrounding these issues. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On foot of the Government decision in February 2000 to introduce electronic voting and counting and subsequent decisions with regard to the phased roll-out of the project, my Department has been tasked with developing and delivering the project in conjunction with returning officers. Voting machines for the two pilot polls were delivered in 2002, while the remaining order for the planned nationwide roll-out of the system was placed in early 2003 for delivery later that year.</P>
        <P>Consequently, my Department wrote to all returning officers in January 2003 asking them to make appropriate arrangements for storage of the voting equipment in advance of delivery of the equipment and giving indications of the approximate space needed. The key requirement for the storage of the voting machines and ancillary equipment is that the premises are dry and not subject to damp conditions. Returning officers were asked, in the first instance, to consider whether existing storage facilities were suitable for electronic voting equipment, to inquire, with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, as to alternative storage premises in public buildings, such as local authority offices or courthouses, or, failing that, in other suitable accommodation locally.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials, such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments, stationery etc. has always been a matter for returning officers who are statutorily responsible for conducting elections and referenda. Accordingly, similar responsibility rests with them with regard to the storage of electronic voting machines and equipment. With significant investment being made in modernising the electoral system, returning officers were entrusted with the task of procuring suitable dry accommodation for the electronic voting machines and ancillary equipment.</P>
        <P>In view of returning officer responsibilities and the statutory independence of their function, my Department had no involvement in the procurement processes. Nevertheless, summary information on storage costs and arrangements was received in the Department from the returning officers. Four returning officers were able to avail of storage facilities in their local courthouse free of charge. However, due to lack of space, the majority of returning officers, namely 24, had to source alternative accommodation with the average costs working out at just over &euro;27,000 per annum.</P>
        <P>The total annual cost for storage of electronic voting equipment, including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates, heating etc., is &euro;659,000, including VAT. In some instances, storage comprises only an element of the rental costs, with some returning officers taking the opportunity to acquire modern accommodation for storage, the training of polling staff and other electoral administrative duties. This was a necessary step for health and safety reasons and as former accommodation in courthouses and local auth<Col N="1314"/>ority premises was gradually becoming unavailable.</P>
        <P>There are ongoing costs for storage of existing ballot boxes and other manual election equipment. An intended consequence of electronic voting is that the requirements of the Office of Public Works and the Government Supplies Agency to maintain large elections stores facilities, containing stationery, polling information cards, ballot boxes and other related items would no longer exist.</P>
        <P>In addition to storage cost information, six returning officers supplied details of ownership of the storage premises and this information was presented to the House in reply to Deputy McGrath last week.</P>
        <P>To get more comprehensive data on storage arrangements, my Department has written to all returning officers seeking further information on storage and insurance arrangements, including specific data on ownership and compliance with public procurement requirements. I will make this information known to the House once these returns are received and collated.</P>
        <P>I am confident my Department and the Department of Finance will continue to work with returning officers to ensure the necessary storage facilities are provided as economically and cost efficiently as possible. The fundamental point is that the system is continuing as it has always been.</P>

	<P>The case I wish to raise concerns a young man from Tallaght. He was assaulted in Dublin&rsquo;s Temple Bar. Such an assault is probably a parent&rsquo;s greatest nightmare. The young man went into town for a drink and was assaulted and left for dead. If a tourist had not spotted him and put him into the recovery position, the young man would have died. He was in a coma for a considerable period. While he was in the coma his parents were unaware of where he was, which added to their worry. They eventually found him.</P>
        <P>The family were told there would be a care plan for the young man, which would start with hospitalisation. When he came out of the coma he was violent, which I am told is quite common in such cases. He is still being treated in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital. The care plan was to start with hospitalisation and proceed to rehabilitation, speech therapy and going home, after which it was hoped he would return to work. Both of the young man&rsquo;s parents work and there are younger children in the family. During the time the young man was in a coma, the parents took time off work. It amounted to a considerable period. The young man was assaulted on 9 January and it is now 15 February.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that the next step in the young man&rsquo;s recovery is rehabilitation but the parents have been told there is an eight to ten week waiting list for rehabilitation. There is pressure from the hospital authorities on the parents to take the young man home. However, they believe they are unable to look after him. Although the nightmare <Col N="1315"/>is over to some extent, the parents are at their wits&rsquo; end. They are under pressure to take the young man home and, indeed, they want to do so. In fact, they took him home last weekend for a couple of hours. He watched the match but when asked after the match what teams were playing he could not remember. He is clearly in need of more help. There is also difficulty getting the young man up and down the stairs in the family home to use the toilet and so forth.</P>
        <P>If the young man remains in hospital, he will regress. He has progressed in leaps and bounds but the difficulty is with the rehabilitation process. There is nowhere for him to go for the next step of his recovery. I have written to the Minister for Health and Children, the health executive, the hospital and the rehabilitation hospital. I have received responses outlining all types of difficulties. However, the parents are seeking help. I told them I would raise the question in the House. The parents believe the system is failing them because the next step in treatment is not available for their child.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will have good news for this family. I have described this situation as a nightmare but it is one that could happen to any family. The reply I received from the hospital stated that rehabilitation should be the next step. It also outlines the hospital&rsquo;s concern that the young man will regress if he is left in the acute hospital environment. It is clearly a difficult case and is something that could affect any family.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify the matter relating to the provision of rehabilitation for Mr. Alan McCarton.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for rehabilitation services.</P>
        <P>The Department has made inquiries into this matter. The National Rehabilitation Hospital has confirmed that Mr. McCarton has been referred to it for assessment and it will endeavour to facilitate him as soon as possible. The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of admission to the hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and is determined solely on the basis of medical priority.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the health funded services in the disability services sector have advanced greatly over the last number of years. It is also acknowledged, however, that further work is required in the coming years. In December 2004, the Government was in a position to announce on budget day a special disability multi-annual funding package with a total value of close to &euro;900 million over the years 2006 to 2009. This funding is being dedicated now for the period until 2009 to ensure the delivery of these high <Col N="1316"/>priority disability services. This package includes guaranteed additional current spending of almost &euro;600 million. The Government has also agreed to allocate &euro;300 million out of the revised capital envelope to these high priority disability services.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the new funding package will go to the health sector where it will be invested in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities and mental health services. It will focus, in particular, on the provision of extra residential, respite and day places, extra home support and personal assistance and extra places in community based mental health facilities.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this matter to plea that the remit and scope of the Standards in Public Office Commission be extended. Both the Quigley report and today&rsquo;s Standards in Public Office Commission report show that existing standards are set extremely low. To clear the air, there must be fundamental reform of the Standards in Public Office Commission to ensure the Government is accountable and transparent and to ensure decisions are made in a clear and understandable way.</P>
        <P>Reforms are necessary to ensure that when a Minister puts pressure to have somebody employed on an urgent basis, it will be a matter of public record. Details of such contracts must be made public the moment they are signed. People deserve to know what is happening. It is not good enough that somebody can work on a lucrative contract for a Department while, at the same time, also being involved in serious fundraising in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency. There is a clear conflict of interest. Investigations to date have shown there is a need to reform the legislation on ethics in public office and the standards in public office legislation. We must ensure the commission is given more clout and that where there is impropriety or the perception of impropriety there will be an investigation.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister outline the instances in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government since the Government took office where contracts have been awarded as a matter of extreme urgency without regard to the normal tendering process? The Taoiseach should lay before the House the various instances where such contracts have been awarded by each Minister so the air can be cleared on this matter. With regard to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, was there a difficulty in external communication prior to Deputy Cullen taking office in mid-2002? Was there a crying need to employ a consultant to look after the Department&rsquo;s public relations?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government consider putting in place measures to ensure companies or individuals that have substantial contracts with Departments are precluded from political fundraising for the Minister overseeing those Departments? There is a conflict of interest if those individuals are working by <Col N="1317"/>day for the Department and volunteering to work for the Minister by night. That has to be addressed within the legislation.</P>
        <P>I wonder if the Minister will ensure that an up-to-date register of consultants is kept and that their terms of reference are a matter of public record? In light of the recent investigations by the Standards in Public Office Commission, will the Minister consider putting clear criteria in place for foreign travel by consultants engaged by the Department?</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach have any plans to extend the scope and remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission? I would like to know whether there are criteria in place for the engagement of public relations consultants by Departments and, if so, may we have a copy of them? It certainly leaves me scratching my head to know that there was a reputable firm of public relations consultants, Drury Communications, working on a significant contract for the Department, yet the Minister in his wisdom saw fit to engage another consultant on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, that was later subjected to a clear tendering process.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that a consultant engaged on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and then ratified through a tender process was in a key position when it came to awarding another lucrative contract for the dissemination of information regarding electronic voting.</P>
        <P>All in all, there is still a murky aspect to this affair, elements of which remain to be addressed. I want the Government to address them. The affair reflects badly on the Minister, Deputy Cullen, on the Taoiseach and on the Government. The Government should shed light on an issue that is important to the proper carrying out of its work. It is crucial to ensure that the Government is held accountable and that the Government is in touch with the people rather than remaining arrogant and aloof in its deliberations and actions.</P>

	<P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s Adjournment matter calls for the scope and remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission to be extended. As the House is aware, the Standards in Public Office Commission has extensive powers to investigate matters under the provisions of the relevant legislation, in particular, sections 4 and 7 of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.</P>
        <P>There are no plans at present to extend the scope and remit of these powers of investigation. In the course of Deputy Cuffe&rsquo;s contribution I did not hear any concrete proposal as to how they should be extended. The operation of the Act and any representations in regard to its scope and remit, are kept under review at the Department of Finance, subject at all times to the independence of the Standards in Public Office Commission in the exercise of its functions.</P>
        <P>I note that the Deputy has not made any specific proposal about the scope and remit of the Act &mdash; only a general aspiration that it should be extended. The Minister for Finance will certainly consider any specific proposals that might be <Col N="1318"/>made but there is no indication available to him that the existing legislation does not provide adequate powers for the commission in this regard.</P>
        <P>In summary, there is no specific indication that the scope and remit of the Standards in Public Office Commission require extension. However, this is relatively recent legislation and a relatively new statutory body. In monitoring the commission&rsquo;s operations, the Department will be receptive to suggestions, including suggestions from the commission itself as to how its operations and effectiveness might be improved.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe raised a number of matters concerning the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. I must point out to Deputy Cuffe, however, that these matters have been canvassed extensively in the Quigley report. Many of the questions Deputy Cuffe has raised were dealt with and answered by Mr. Quigley in his report, which was requested by the Taoiseach and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas some time ago.</P>
        <P>As regards the other matters to which the Deputy referred, he can elicit the information in the normal way through tabling parliamentary questions.</P>
        <P>Deputy Cuffe raised one other matter fundamental to the operation of democracy here &mdash; that is, his suggestion that persons who are not public servants should be precluded from engaging in political activities. I certainly do not agree with that. It is yet another example of the tendency of the Green Party to try to manufacture a political stage that will only convenience them, and to say that everyone else should get off the stage.</P>

      <sTitle>Schools Amalgamation.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter concerns an eight-year battle we have had in Tuam to have St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and St. Jarlath&rsquo;s College amalgamated. I raised this matter on 28 October 2004 and I have the impression that I am speaking to the wind but I will continue to bring up the matter until I get an answer. I do not intend to go back through the history of the proposed amalgamation of the colleges. Suffice to say that it all started eight years ago and the plan was considered to be in the best interests of the school-going fraternity in both colleges. It was the best step to take from an educational viewpoint but why has it taken eight years to get to this stage? I hope the Minister of State will have some facts for me this evening.</P>
        <P>On the last occasion, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealt with my query on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. Having raised the matter last October, I met the new Minister for Education and Science, together with other representatives from east Galway. We were led to believe then that we would soon be told what would happen.</P>
        <P>In common with every other project, I was informed at the time that the 2005 allocation &mdash; this wonderful, multi-annual programme the Government has to cover all the evils in school buildings &mdash; would be announced early in the new <Col N="1319"/>year. It was announced but this amalgamation was not mentioned. Some Deputies in east Galway seem to believe it is only a matter of days or weeks until this amalgamation receives the go-ahead. I sincerely hope they are right but as an opposition spokesman with a particular interest in this amalgamation, I am far from satisfied with the speed at which this matter is being handled.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister of State explain the current status of the amalgamation? Is it true that departmental personnel are currently examining the schools&rsquo; structures? Is that happening as we speak? Will the approval to proceed to the planning and subsequent stages be announced next week, next month or next year? There appears to be a body of opinion, shared by some of my colleagues in east Galway, that the amalgamation will be announced in a few days. I cannot understand why it was not announced in the 2005 allocations, which were unveiled last month. At a meeting before Christmas, my colleagues and I informed the new Minister of the current situation. God knows, after eight years all the information on the detailed work that should have been done must be available.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with the roof of St. Patrick&rsquo;s College. It is a technical matter but a sum of money was made available for roofing repairs. However, I understand it has now become apparent to both the Department and the school authorities that the money should be spent in a different manner to that first approved by the Minister. It would make a huge difference to the school if it could be expended in a slightly different way. That is enough for me to put on the record because I assume the departmental officials know exactly what I am talking about. That is important.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, agreement was reached some time ago on the rationalisation of post-primary education provision in Tuam. Agreement has been reached with the relevant trustees to form a single boys <Col N="1320"/>and a single girls school, each to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 700 pupils. The vocational school is not part of either amalgamation process.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The school planning section of the Department of Education and Science has agreed with the management authorities of both schools involved in the amalgamation that the optimum plan to address the accommodation needs of the single school, which will result from the amalgamation, is to extend facilities at St. Jarlath&rsquo;s College and to refurbish the existing facilities. The objective is to ensure facilities at the new school will serve the needs of the school community well into the future.</P>
        <P>The project at Tuam has been assessed and assigned a band 1.4 rating in accordance with the revised prioritisation criteria published earlier this year following consultation with the education partners. This band rating will positively influence the timescale for delivery of this project. Officials in the Department are in regular contact with the school authorities to progress the detailed preliminary work necessary to facilitate this large-scale building project.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Education and Science recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme, which provided details of 122 major school building projects countrywide. This announcement is the first in a series that the Minister plans to make in the coming period on the schools building and modernisation programme, which will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships; an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme; schools whose projects will further progress through the design process; and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>
        <P>The Deputy would like St. Jarlath&rsquo;s to fall into the latter two categories. I assure him that the needs of St. Patrick&rsquo;s and St. Jarlath&rsquo;s are being considered in this context and I will convey his comments to the Minister. It is difficult to read between the lines on these projects but a number of people may look on this proposal too optimistically. While further phases must be undertaken, the last phase to be announced will be the most significant. Progress will be possible during the year. I note the Deputy&rsquo;s frustrations and I will speak to the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 108 together.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004, the board of the Dublin Airport Authority has a statutory mandate to do everything necessary to give effect to the restructuring of the State airports.</P>
        <P>The Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities were incorporated in October 2004 and in line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, these two new authorities will, in due course, own and operate their respective airports once sufficient distributable reserves are available to transfer the relevant assets.</P>
        <P>Prior to the assets of Shannon and Cork airports being vested in their respective authorities, their boards are charged with preparing to assume full responsibility for the management and development of their airports. They are also empowered to undertake functions delegated to them, on an agreed basis, by the Dublin Airport Authority. Each of the airport authorities is also required to prepare comprehensive business plans for their airports.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the 2004 Act, the transfer of assets to Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities cannot take place earlier than 30 April 2005 and, thereafter, a phased approach will allow one of the new airport authorities to be vested first, that is, Shannon Airport, while Cork Airport will be vested once sufficient distributable reserves have been built up within the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>Both I and the Minister for Finance must be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork Airport Authorities before the assets of the airports are vested in those authorities. The formulation of <Col N="1322"/>comprehensive business plans by the new boards will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness. The business planning process has been initiated with a view to meeting the requirements of the State Airports Act.</P>
        <P>Since its incorporation in September last, the Shannon Airport Authority has been considering, under the overall stewardship of the Dublin Airport Authority, a range of measures for the future successful development of the airport on a sustainable basis. The airport authority has stated that these measures include initiatives to promote traffic growth through Shannon Airport together with measures to address the airport&rsquo;s cost base. It has been recognised for some time that costs in Shannon Airport are high relative to comparable airports and that this is an issue that needs to be addressed to position the airport to be able to continue its valuable contribution to business, tourism and the regional economy generally of the mid-west.</P>
        <P>I expect that arrangements for implementing rationalisation can be agreed through consultation between management and union representatives. The authority has made it clear that it is looking to engage with trade union representatives on its proposals and that it is expected that any necessary staff reductions can be achieved by means of voluntary early retirement or voluntary severance schemes. The objective is to develop a long-term sustainable business at Shannon Airport, which is a major feature of the thinking underlying the State Airports Act 2004.</P>
        <P>As to Cork and Dublin, it is a matter for the relevant airport authorities to assess on an ongoing basis the measures necessary to ensure that the airports can operate in a financially sustainable way.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the new boards of the three airport authorities will successfully meet the challenges ahead. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry.</P>

        <Quest>the process which his Department is engaging in to establish the ten-year transport investment plan proposed in budget 2005; the analysis which has been undertaken to help prioritise projects; and the planning guidelines which are being used to provide a background to the investment decisions that are being made.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>In his recent Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance agreed in principle that an extended ten-year capital envelope was appropriate in the case of investment in transport. This reflects the reality of the long lead-in times required for design and planning as well as the substantial construction periods required for major capital projects in the transport sector. It also provides clear and concrete evidence of this Government&rsquo;s determination to provide our First World economy with a first-rate transport system.</P>
        <P>The ten-year transport investment framework will identify the investment and outline the measures required to develop further all elements of national transport infrastructure, address existing bottlenecks and capacity constraints, enhance quality, optimise the use of the network and make prudent advance provision for future economic growth. It is not possible to outline the specifics of the draft plan pending its consideration by the Cabinet infrastructure committee and by the Cabinet itself.</P>
        <P>The ten-year framework will take account of the substantial changes over the last 15 years or so. We have seen large increases in our population, wealth and employment. Economic growth has led to huge increases in the amount of goods being transported as well as strong growth in car ownership levels, increased travel demand and increases in the numbers of people and goods passing through our airports and ports.</P>
        <P>The ten-year framework will also take account of the linkages between transport and land use and spatial planning so that we can develop a transport system that contributes to sustainable development in all its dimensions &mdash; economic, social and environmental. The plan will be fully informed by and will support the policies set out in the national spatial strategy. It will also take account of the regional planning guidelines adopted during 2004 and will be informed by and support a number of regional land use and transportation strategies for the cities, such as the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s long-term strategy, A Platform for Change, and the Cork area strategic plan. I am also considering whether the development of this draft framework will fall within the scope of the strategic environmental assessment directive.</P>
        <P>My officials have been engaging with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office, and the expertise and inputs of these agencies have been significant in helping to identify broad lines and priorities for programmes to be undertaken under the auspices of the new framework.</P>
        <P>The current five-year investment envelope for transport investment is &euro;10.2 billion over the 2005 to 2009 period. The precise financial parameters for the period to 2014 will be subject to final agreement with the Minister for Finance and the Government. Details of the draft plan are being <Col N="1324"/>finalised and I will be bringing it to the Cabinet infrastructure committee early next month.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of destination signposting is a matter for the relevant local authority in the first instance. The traffic signs manual 1996 sets out directions given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95(16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 regarding the provision and use of warning and information traffic signs, including directional information signs. A copy of the manual is available in the Oireachtas Library. The manual contains advice for road authorities in relation to the provision of directional signs on national routes. The policy on content of all advance directional signs on national primary routes is to display the terminal destination of the national route plus terminal of spur route.</P>
        <P>The recognised terminal destinations listed in the traffic signs manual for national primary road N2 are Derry and Dublin and, accordingly, destination signage on routes leaving Dublin indicate Derry. My Department is pursuing a comprehensive review of the present traffic signs manual in association with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Consultants have been engaged to prepare a new manual. The issue of the format and content of destination signs will be considered in the context of this review. The example referred to by the Deputy in relation to Donegal raises a wider question as to the signing of destinations and this will be the subject of particular examination in that review.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 150 and 154 together.</P><Col N="1325"/>
        <P>As I have indicated previously, I have met the key stakeholders in public transport and welcome the consensus that both State-owned and private bus companies have valuable roles to play in delivering future public transport needs. The overall objectives of public transport policy are to ensure the provision of a well-functioning, integrated public transport system which enhances competitiveness, sustains economic progress and contributes to social cohesion; to ensure the provision of a defined standard of public transport at reasonable cost to the customer and the taxpayer; and to ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of the accelerated investment in infrastructure and facilities necessary to ensure improved public transport provision.</P>
        <P>A key element of our public transport system is the bus market. The Transport Act 1932 provides the statutory basis for regulating the bus market. This Act is outdated and is in need of reform. It is a commitment of the Government to replace the Act with a modern regulatory framework which achieves a more open, effective and competitive regime.</P>
        <P>The public transport market is an expanding market and I am committed to reforming measures to provide opportunities for both public and private companies to deliver increased public services and to ensure the taxpayer and the customer gets a high quality of service and best value for money in line with our overall objectives. I want to see more people using a better and more extensive public transport network. In this context, it remains my intention to establish an independent national public transport procurement and regulatory body to,<i> inter alia</i>, procure socially necessary bus services, licence commercial services and regulate fares.</P>
        <P>Officials in my Department continue to meet stakeholders regarding their views on how to reform the market within the framework I have set out. When I have had an opportunity to consider these views, I will decide how best, in a spirit of partnership, to give effect to reform of the public transport market.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 119 together.</P>
        <P>I announced on 21 October 2004 that the operational height of the Dublin Port tunnel will not be changed. My decision was based primarily on safety grounds but cost and time delays to the opening of the project were also factors. The Dublin Port tunnel, therefore, is being completed as planned and will have an operational height of 4.65 m.</P>
        <P>It is the view of Dublin City Council and the NRA that the Dublin Port tunnel will facilitate almost all the HGV traffic currently using Dublin Port. Two vehicle height surveys of HGVs using Dublin Port, one by the Dublin Port Company and one by the National Institute of Transport and Logistics, indicate that between 0.6% and 1.7% of HGVs entering and leaving the port exceed 4.65 m.</P>

        <P>I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is finalising an engineering feasibility study of the proposed Glounthaune to Midleton section of the line. It appears that there are no insurmountable engineering difficulties and the company will proceed to the public consultation phase shortly. An application for a railway order will follow under <Col N="1328"/>the terms of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001. The feasibility study will identify the projected cost of reinstating the line and will establish a timeframe for the project. The project will be financed by the Exchequer, EU funds and by special contribution schemes, established by the local authorities in Cork.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The planning, design and implementation of national roads improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the relevant local authorities concerned &mdash; in this case Westmeath County Council. I assume the Deputy is referring to a recent newspaper report compar<Col N="1329"/>ing the cost of the upgrade of the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4-N6 to the estimated cost of the Kinnegad-Athlone section of the N6.</P>
        <P>I understand from the NRA that the report was inaccurate in a number of respects. The Kilcock to Kinnegad section is a full motorway with provision for the addition of a third lane in the median should that be necessary in the future. The Kinnegad to Kilbeggan section is a standard dual carriageway. Typically, there is a construction cost difference, using standard costings, of over &euro;2 million per kilometre between these two road types. This alone would generate a difference in costs of at least &euro;80 million between the two road types for a 39 km motorway.</P>
        <P>The amount of private finance assigned in the newspaper report to the Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme for the purpose of calculating the per kilometre costs was overstated by over &euro;40 million and the length of the Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme was understated by 4 km which would cost approximately &euro;35 million to construct. The combination of these amounted to an overestimate of &euro;120 million.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme costs include provision for maintenance and reinvestment throughout the 30 year concession period and no such maintenance or life-cycle reinvestment costs apply in the tender price for design and build schemes. The Kilcock-Kinnegad scheme will require the construction of a toll plaza. Allowing for a three year construction period tolls will be payable over 27 years.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that all national road schemes are procured by means of a competitive tendering process in accordance with national and EU tendering and procurement regulations and the Kilcock to Kinnegad PPP contract was subject to rigorous evaluation and the conclusion reached by independent financial advisers to the NRA was that it represented excellent value for money.</P>

	<P>The West-Link bridge toll agreement, concluded in October 1987 between the then Dublin County Council and NTR, provides that the toll company, NTR plc, has until the expiry of the agreement in the year 2020, the exclusive right to toll traffic using the West-Link bridge. A buy-out of NTR&rsquo;s rights has not been considered having regard to the potential cost involved, the possible implications for the funding of the upgrade of the M50, and the limited contribution the removal of the toll plaza would make to the reduction of traffic congestion overall on the M50.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 122 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of median barriers on national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, having regard to best practice in road safety and EU standards for safety barriers of this type.</P>
        <P>The position generally in regard to the provision of median barriers on national roads is that: median barriers are currently being provided on all new motorways and dual carriageways irrespective of the median width; and median barriers are being retrofitted on all existing inter-urban motorways and dual carriageways irrespective of median width. This work is expected to be completed by mid-2005 with the exception of the M50.</P>
        <P>In the specific case of the M50, the NRA had originally intended to provide median barriers in the context of the upgrade project which is due to get under way, subject to An Bord Plean&aacute;la approval, on a phased basis in late 2005 for phase 1 and in 2006 for phase 2.</P>
        <P>However, in light of a tragic crossover accident on the M50 in late 2004, in which a young woman lost her life, the NRA reviewed the position in <Col N="1331"/>relation to the M50 and have now decided to proceed with the erection of crash barriers on the M50 with the aim of having the work substantially complete or underway on all sections of the motorway by the end of 2005. This approach will achieve the permanent installation of crash barriers on the motorway at a significantly earlier date than was previously anticipated.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 153, 347 and 364 together.</P>
        <P>The relevant provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2004 that establish a new system of speed limits based on metric values were commenced on 20 January 2005. The changeover process involved the provision of more than 58,000 traffic signs depicting the application of speed limits across the country. The new traffic signs that were provided prior to 20 January indicate the locations at which the default speed limits provided for in the 2004 Act apply or the locations at which special speed limits that had been determined special speed limits already made by county and city councils apply in lieu of default speed limits. The power to apply special speed limits has been vested in the elected members of county and city councils since the passage of the Road Traffic Act 1994.</P>
        <P>The determination of what speed limit should apply at particular locations in lieu of a default speed limit is a matter for the elected members of city and county councils. The Minister for Transport has no statutory power to issue instructions or directions in this regard.</P>
        <P>Through section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 determinations relating to the application of special speed limits made by county and city councils under the previous legislation are deemed to continue to apply. The application of the new special speed limit of 30 km/h could not have been applied from the date of the changeover to metric speed limits in view of the fact that <Col N="1333"/>its deployment may only be pursued through the provisions relating to special speed limits under the new Act.</P>
        <P>Section 9 of the 2004 Act sets out a new process for the making of speed limit by-laws by the elected members of county and city councils. The range of options available to county and city councils in relation to the deployment of special speed limits has been expanded by comparison to previous legislation. It also provides that the Minister for Transport may issue guidelines relating to the making of special speed limit by-laws.</P>
        <P>With the commencement of the provisions in the Road Traffic Act 2004 relating to speed limits generally with effect from 20 January 2005 and the completion of the programme for the provision of the traffic signs necessary to support the actual changeover, county and city councils are now free to embark on the process of making new special speed limit by-laws.</P>
        <P>The deployment of the new 30 km/h special speed limit may only be pursued in accordance with provisions in guidelines that I am empowered to issue under section 9. Draft guidelines are being prepared at present and my Department is currently engaged in a consultation process with county and city councils. That process will be completed in the coming weeks and I will then issue the statutory guidelines to the local authorities on a formal basis. Within a matter of weeks therefore, local authorities will be in a position to pursue the full range of initiatives available through special speed limit by-laws including the provision of appropriate low speed limits in the vicinity of schools and other high risk locations.</P>

	<P>It is expected that all the projects in the public transport sector, which are being funded under the national development plan, will be completed. Projects completed to date have been done on time and within budget. The very significant Exchequer allocation to my Department in respect of the provision of transport infrastructure clearly demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s strong ongoing commitment to the NDP programme and to maintaining a high level of investment in infrastructural projects. Over &euro;2.4 billion has been spent from Exchequer and EU funds to date, with public transport capital expenditure for this year at &euro;486 million.</P>
        <P>Services on the two Luas lines, the green line from Sandyford to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the red line from Tallaght to Connolly Station are operating to wide public acclaim since June and September 2004, respectively. The Railway Pro<Col N="1334"/>curement Agency, RPA, the body with responsibility for the Luas project, has assured me that the Sandyford and Tallaght lines will be completed within the &euro;775 million budget, as notified to the Government in December 2002.</P>
        <P>The national development plan provides for a substantial investment in the upgrade of the national roads network over the period 2000-06. Significant priorities within the national roads programme are the upgrade of the five main inter-urban routes, linking Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dundalk with Dublin, to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard, the construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel and the M50 and major improvement works on other national routes throughout the country. While the completion of this upgrade programme will extend beyond 2006 and will cost more than estimated in 1999, good progress is nevertheless being made in implementing the ambitious NDP upgrade programme.</P>
        <P>The current position in relation to the upgrading of the five major inter-urban routes is that the M1 is expected to be fully complete by end 2006. Work is complete on major projects on the N7, Kildare, Monasterevin bypasses and Limerick southern ring road phase 1, and the N8, Cashel and Watergrasshill bypasses. Work is underway on the Kilcock-Kinnegad section of the N4-N6 on the Dundalk western bypass on the M1, on the Fermoy bypass, N8, and on Naas Road widening, N7. Work is expected to start this year on such major projects as, the Dundalk to Newry section of the M1, Kinnegad-Athlone on the N6, phase 1 of the M50 upgrade and Waterford city bypass.</P>
        <P>Completion of these projects will eliminate many of the major bottlenecks on these routes. Good progress has been made also on upgrading routes other than the major inter-urban routes. Major projects completed in recent years include bypasses of Rathnew-Ashford, Ballincollig and Youghal. Projects under way or due to start in 2005 include Ennis bypass, Sligo inner relief road, Monaghan bypass, Mullingar bypass and the N55 Cavan bypass.</P>
        <P>In addition, it is expected that compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements for the remaining projects in planning on these routes will either be approved by, or be before, An Bord Plean&aacute;la by early 2005.</P>
        <P>In relation to the national roads programme overall, it should be noted that since 2000 a total of 47 projects, nearly 330 km, have been completed. Work is in progress on 20 projects, almost 200 km, and another eight projects, 140 km, are at tender stage with a further 12 projects, 167 km, through the statutory approval process.</P>
        <P>The first round of approved projects was completed on time and within grant allocation. Projects selected for grant-aid under the second round have recently been approved and will be announced shortly.</P>
        <P>It will be clear from the capital investment framework and the budget commitment to a ten year transport capital programme that the <Col N="1335"/>Government is fully committed to maintaining investment at high level and to the transformation of our transport networks.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>A key element in improving bus performance has been the provision of quality bus corridors. So far, there are nine QBCs in operation in the Dublin area &mdash; Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, north Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown. It is proposed to complete a number of projects in the course of 2005, accounting for a total of about 40 km in length. However, the sections of new QBCs that will be completed in 2005 depend on the outcome of public consultation and tendering processes.</P>
        <P>I have allocated &euro;40 million to the traffic management grants scheme for 2005. The QBCs account for a significant proportion of the fund<Col N="1336"/>ing under this scheme, which is administered by the Dublin Transportation Office. The specific amount to be allocated for QBC projects has not yet been finalised by the DTO steering committee. Therefore, these projects are also dependent on funding being provided.</P>
        <P>The capacity of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann has been significantly expanded, particularly at peak times, with capacity increased by almost 25% in recent years. I understand the management of Dublin Bus is currently examining ways of maximising utilisation of the existing bus fleet in light of the significant investment made to date under the national development plan, including investment in other modes and the ongoing changes in demand patterns for Dublin. In this context, it would be premature to make any decisions on further investment in additional capacity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the concept of a Dublin outer orbital route. Both the strategic planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area 1999 and the DTO&rsquo;s, Platform for Change 2000, identified a possible need for a Dublin outer orbital route linking Drogheda-Navan-Naas. More recently the regional planning guidelines, RPG, for the greater Dublin area 2004 also provide for the development of such a route in the medium to longer term on the basis that these centres would be strengthened by the provision of good links between them without having to pass through the Dublin city area. A 2001 strategic study commissioned by the NRA of a Dublin outer orbital route concluded that such a route had significant merit and is feasible on engineering and environmental grounds. As a high level strategic study of the concept, the 2001 report, apart from identifying a possible corridor for an outer orbital, did not consider route options, appropriate road type and costs. Detailed consideration of these and other issues including spatial planning, land use and environmental issues and the appropriate type and class of road to be provided will be the subject of further studies.</P>
        <P>I have asked the NRA to carry out these further studies and to consider the proposed route as part of future road infrastructure development plans taking account of the national spatial strategy, the regional planning guidelines and the planning and traffic implications of such a route for the greater Dublin region and neighbouring regions. The proposal will also be considered in the context of the ten year transport investment framework presently being prepared within my Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I made no request to National Toll Roads to review its decision to increase toll charges at the West Link Bridge. The West-Link toll agreement, approved in principle by Government in October 1984 and concluded in October 1987, provides that the tolls can be increased in line with inflation. The maximum toll that can be charged at West-Link is updated each year by reference to the consumer price index. More specifically, the maximum toll from 1 January of any year is calculated as the aggregate of: the base tolls, as set out in the toll scheme by-laws, multiplied by the consumer price index for August of the preceding year divided by the opening index, as set out in the by-laws, and VAT at the prevailing rate on the amount derived pursuant to subparagraph (a) and the resulting amount is rounded to the nearest 10 cent.</P>
        <P>This is the mechanism followed to determine annual maximum toll charges. Subject to the tolls being within this maximum limit the setting of tolls is a matter for NTR. It is open to NTR to apply lower toll charges should it so decide for commercial, or other reasons, as has been done by the company in the case of heavy goods vehicles.</P>

	<P>The programme for Government provides for the continued support of the six regional airports including Knock Airport and my Department provides a range of financial mechanisms in support of this objective. Knock Airport benefits considerably through a range of direct and indirect support mechanisms, namely, capital grant assistance towards essential infrastructural improvements under the BMW regional operational programme of the NDP, the allocation of assistance towards marketing, safety and security related expenditure incurred by the airport and scheduled flights supported by the PSO programme.</P>
        <P>Under the NDP capital measure, my Department has provided &euro;2.337 million in grant-aid towards essential infrastructural improvements at the airport since December 2001. The primary purpose of the NDP measure is to provide grant <Col N="1338"/>assistance to facilitate the continued safe and viable operations at the airport. As to the recent expansion plans submitted by the airport company, those proposals have been evaluated in the light of the existing approach to grant assistance to regional airports. I will shortly announce the next round of capital grant allocations under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the role that the airport can play in stimulating more balanced economic development for the north-west, my Department will continue to assist Knock Airport as it develops into the future. However, any capital expenditure allocation of Exchequer funding to Knock and the other regional airports will be in line with the existing policy of prioritising those projects that are required for safety and security reasons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year CIE applied for a fares increase for 2005 for each of the operating companies averaging 8%. Following a detailed examination of the application and the financial position of each of the companies, I agreed to a fare increase which would yield a 3.5% increase in revenue to CIE. This in effect meant that most Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath fares increased by 5 cent or 10 cent and a range of increases applied across the board in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann fares depending on journey distance.</P>
        <P>The annual subvention to the CIE companies is paid in respect of the provision of socially necessary but non-commercial transport services. The subvention has been increased annually by 5% since 2001. I am satisfied that the increase in fares yield, together with the 5% increase in subvention and cost improvement measures being undertaken by the companies are adequate to enable CIE to maintain the financial stability of the group.</P>

	<P>The offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay currently comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system. The amount of the on-the-spot fine applicable to this offence is &euro;19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences. Where a person does not pay the on-the-spot fine and is subsequently convicted in court of the said offence he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;800 for a first offence. The maximum fine for a second or subsequent offence is &euro;1,500 and in the case of a third or subsequent offence committed within a 12 month period &euro;1,500 and-or a prison sentence of up to three months.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system already applies to the offences of exceeding a speed limit and non-compliance with seat belt regulations. The original amount of the fixed charge will automatically increase by 50% where payment is not made within 28 days of the date of the original notice.</P>
        <P>Regulations to provide for the roll-out of the fixed charge system to the majority of traffic and parking offences, including the offence of parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay, are currently being prepared by the Department of Transport in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I indicated in the D&aacute;il during the passage of the Road Traffic Bill before Christmas that I intend that the level of fixed charge for the offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay will be pitched at a level that will be significantly higher than the fixed charge for other parking offences. The operation of the fixed charge system is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda. I understand that it is expected to have the new system available during the second quarter of 2005. Regulations to support the extension of the fixed charge system to a range of offences, including the offence of illegally parking <Col N="1341"/>in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay will be put in place.</P>

	<P>The question of whether to impose a specific maximum height standard for vehicles is being considered by my Department at present. In December 2004 I initiated a wide consultation process on the matter with the publication of a discussion document and an invitation to interested parties to make submissions. As outlined in the discussion document, a range of factors of national importance such as business competitiveness, rail safety, environmental and quality of life issues, protection of existing infrastructure, and the need for certainty in planning for future infrastructure investment, will influence the decision.</P>
        <P>By the closing date of 28 January, 41 responses to the discussion document had been received in my Department. I will now carefully consider these responses and all the factors mentioned before I make a decision in this matter.</P>

	<P>A disproportionate number of cyclists&rsquo; fatalities are through collisions with heavy goods vehicles. Developments at EU level will result in new heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, having to comply with higher standards in relation to the fields of vision of drivers. In November 2003, the EU adopted Directive 2003/97/EC, which provides for an extension of the field of vision to address the issue of blind spots. The directive harmonises the rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision, including mirrors and camera-monitors, on motor vehicles and of vehicles equipped with these devices. These enhanced requirements should lead to a reduction in fatalities and serious injuries involving pedestrians and cyclists due to the driver&rsquo;s inadequate field of <Col N="1343"/>vision. The directive requires all new HGVs entering into service from 26 January 2007 to meet the revised standards for field of vision set in the directive.</P>
        <P>The Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, has a strong commitment to the improvement of road safety and has taken a number of initiatives in recent times to improve safety awareness with regard to the more vulnerable road user such as cyclists and school children.</P>
        <P>On a more general basis, the National Safety Council has been mandated with responsibility for road safety advertising and education. The council has developed safe cycling leaflets to promote the use of reflective clothing and safe cycling practices. The council also issues road safety advice through the media on a regular basis and generally refers to the vulnerability of cyclists in order to make both cyclists and drivers aware of the importance of road safety.</P>

	<P>In 2000, an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, was formed consisting of representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, National Parents Council, public transport operators and local authorities in order to initiate some pilot safer routes to school schemes in the greater Dublin area. The DTO carried out a review of the pilot programme in 2004 and I am currently awaiting recommendations from the DTO based on the results achieved.</P>
        <P>There were initially six schools involved in this pilot programme. Four continue to be actively engaged in the programme. There are a number of other schools engaged in independent schemes, both inside and outside the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>I am aware that the DTO has received some applications for funding for school safety measures, which are being considered in the context of the overall budget for the traffic management grants scheme administered by the DTO. The steering committee of the DTO is currently finalising the 2005 allocations from this scheme. Whether funding is made available in 2005 for safer routes to schools initiatives is a matter for the DTO steering committee.</P>

        <P>However, if the council is unable to accept the Parliament&rsquo;s second reading, then the conciliation procedure may be invoked with a view to finding a compromise.

	<P>The north-west region is served by two airports, Donegal Regional Airport and City of Derry Airport. The Government has a long-standing policy of assisting City of Derry Airport on the basis that the natural catchment area of the airport includes east Donegal. My Department will continue to support both airports, and air access to the region in general, in keeping with commitments made in the programme for Government.</P>
        <P>The Government recently approved specifications for the next round of contracts under the PSO air services programme. Twice daily return air services on routes linking Dublin with both Donegal and Derry will continue to be subsidised by my Department under the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, Donegal Airport has received almost &euro;1 million in capital grants under the BMW regional operational programme and a further allocation will be announced shortly. Derry City Council submitted proposals for the development of City of Derry Airport last year to my Department, and to the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland which, of course, have the lead responsibility in this area. A report on all aspects of the proposed development, including the extent of works required to make the airport fully operational and compliant with safety requirements is being considered by my Department in the light of consultation with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>While the matter of the provision of bus services in Donegal is for Bus &Eacute;ireann and other private licensed operators to consider on the basis of their assessment of demand, significant improvements can be reported. Stranorlar Bus &Eacute;ireann building was upgraded in 2003, and the upgrade of Letterkenny bus station is now completed. There is increased service frequency on the Letterkenny-Dublin route and on the Donegal-Enniskillen-Dublin route and this month a new service via Dublin Airport was introduced in cooperation with Translink, with ten departures daily serving the airport on the Letterkenny-Derry-Dublin route. Irish Rail and Translink offer the facility to travel by rail from Dublin to Derry, changing at Belfast. I understand that Irish Rail and Translink, the operator of the Northern Ireland railway network, are working to improve journey times by rail.</P>
        <P>The planning, design and implementation of national roads improvement projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the relevant local authorities concerned, in this case Donegal County Council. Major investment in roads in County Donegal includes the completion of the N56 Mountcharles bypass, N15 Donegal bypass, N15 Clar Barnesmore, N13 Bridgend-Northern Ireland Border and the construction of the N15 Bundoran-Ballyshannon bypass, and there are additional major projects in progress and in planning, including the new cross-Border link between the A5 and N15 at Strabane-Lifford. This proposed project will involve the design of a major new bridge over the River Finn and up to <Col N="1346"/>10 km of road linking the strategic N14, N15 and A5 routes. The preliminary design will be completed by mid to late 2005.</P>

	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority has statutory responsibility for regulating the technical and safety aspects of civil aviation and for the provision of air traffic services. In 2004 the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, engaged independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of its operations in the areas of air traffic control and management systems covering the years 2005 to 2010. The review was conducted jointly by international consultants, Airways Corporation of New Zealand and Sofravia, a French company. It was prompted by a number of significant developments and considerations in the air traffic area, including likely changes arising from the implementation of the European Union&rsquo;s single sky proposals, the acquisition by the IAA of an additional block of airspace off the north-west coast to be controlled from Shannon and the completion of a major &euro;115 million investment programme in new air traffic management systems and equipment. This investment included the construction and equipping of new air traffic control centres in Dublin and Shannon.</P>
        <P>The consultants' report was presented to the board of the authority on 28 January 2005. Later that day the report, in full, was presented to the IAA management and to the IAA trade unions. Copies of the report were also forwarded to my Department. Since 28 January the IAA has engaged in a major consultation and communications exercise with its staff. I understand that, following this consultation with unions and staff and consideration by management over coming weeks, a plan of action will then be presented to the board for decision.</P>
        <P>The IAA has indicated that the consultants' report is very positive, that there is no question of compulsory redundancies or compulsory transfers and, where there are implications for stakeholders, these implications will be discussed before implementation. The IAA has also indicated that any changes will be designed to deliver greater efficiencies in the provision of services while at the same time maintaining the highest level of safety.</P>
        <P>My Department will discuss the report with IAA senior management shortly as part of ongoing business review meetings.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to new figures from research carried out by a company (details supplied) that fewer than half of motorists are now driving more carefully as a result of the penalty points system; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that the absence of any high visible Garda fear-factor enforcement, random breath testing and a proper network of speed cameras means drivers believe they will not be caught for road traffic offences; his plans to address this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[4784/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the research to which the Deputy refers. The effectiveness of the penalty points system can be judged primarily on the basis of the contribution it has made to road safety since its introduction. In the first two years since the introduction of the system in October 2002, the number of deaths as a result of road collisions fell by 116 by comparison to the previous two years. The number of road deaths unfortunately increased in 2004 compared to 2003 when we experienced the lowest levels in 40 years. It should be borne in mind, however, that the number of road deaths in 2004 is the third lowest level of road deaths since 1998, the first full year of the road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>Penalty points now operate in respect of speeding, seat-belt wearing, driving without insurance and careless driving. Since the introduction of the system over 209,000 drivers have incurred penalty points. In overall terms the introduction of penalty points has had a very positive effect on road safety and I am confident that the full roll-out of the system will further enhance that effect.</P>
        <P>The intended effect of the penalty points system is to instil greater caution and responsibility in motorists in relation to their driving and to change the driving behaviour of those who repeatedly commit road traffic offences. Indications from the Garda are that, with no reduction in enforcement levels, there has been a significant reduction in speeding detections since the introduction of the penalty point system.</P>
        <P>The new road safety strategy 2004-06 outlines a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over the period in question. In overall terms, measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seat-belt wearing. The strategy recommends the introduction of random breath testing and a network of privately operated speed cameras. Enforcement of road traffic legislation is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and in this context, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently announced plans to create a dedicated traffic corps over the next three years.</P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that Dublin Bus began to transfer buses to Harristown in October 2004 and the depot will be officially opened shortly. Harristown has capacity for 240 buses and the depot will cater for 199 buses immediately. The new garage is required because the Dublin Bus fleet of buses grew from approximately 900 buses in 1997 to 1,062 buses in 2004. Harristown now <Col N="1349"/>enables the company to house all its fleet within the confines of their depots.</P>
        <P>With regard to a further expansion in the Dublin Bus fleet, I understand the management of the company is currently examining ways of maximising the utilisation of the existing bus fleet in light of the significant investment made to date under the national development plan, including investment in other modes and the ongoing changes in demand patterns for Dublin. In this context, it would be premature to make any decisions on further investment in additional capacity.</P>

	<P>The Road Traffic (Ordinary Speed Limits &mdash; Certain Vehicles) Regulations 2005, SI 9 of 2005, made by me on 12 January 2005 prescribe maximum speed limits for certain classes of vehicles from 20 January 2005. The speed limit of 80 km/h limit has been prescribed for vehicles that have accommodation for more than eight passengers, for goods vehicles having a design gross weight in excess of 3,500 kg. and for any vehicle towing a trailer, caravan, horse box, etc. A speed limit of 65 km/h has been prescribed for double deck passenger vehicles.</P>
        <P>In setting the new metric speed limits for these classes of vehicles I made no change to the speed limit policy that had applied since 1992 other than converting the previous maximum limits to the nearest equivalent metric value.</P>
        <P>I made it clear, however, when I announced the vehicle speed limits concerned on 17 January last that I intend to revisit the matter of maximum speed limits for classes of vehicles later in the year. This will be done in consultation with the relevant interest groups.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 and 158 together.</P>
        <P>Proposals are being pursued in my Department to ensure that measures are taken to improve public transport flows and to reduce congestion. The objective of providing bus priority measures is to assist bus operators in meeting their schedules thereby assisting in the achievement of modal shift from the private car to public transport.</P>
        <P>My officials are engaged in discussions with the Dublin Transportation Office, the quality bus network office of Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority to progress how the hard shoulder area could be safely used at congestion hot spot locations on national roads, including those linking Dublin and satellite towns.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible for traffic management in their areas and the progression of bus priority measures involves a sequence of steps such as the identification of congestion pinch points, the carrying out of an engineering inspection of the road at those locations to ascertain the structural carrying capacity of the hard shoulder area and the execution of any strengthening or improvement works necessary. At planning stage, a public consultation process is undertaken in relation to the preliminary design for the bus priority project.</P>
        <P>Pilots of this bus priority initiative are being developed at present at a number of locations, including the northbound and southbound <Col N="1352"/>approaches to Dunshaughlin and at Bracetown between Dunshaughlin and Clonee in County Meath and at various locations on the Naas Road in South Dublin County Council. The operation of the pilot measures will be monitored with a view to having similar measures followed at other suitable locations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>My Department is at present directly engaged in two issues that are relevant to this initiative. In the first instance, it is engaged in consultations with the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the development of special new traffic signs for the purpose of informing road users of the provision of bus lanes in hard shoulders. In addition, guidelines in relation to the deployment of special speed limits are being developed at present. The preparation of the guidelines is one of a number of initiatives contained in the Road Traffic Act 2004 which I brought into operation on 20 January 2005. The Act introduces a more flexible policy for the application of speed limits generally, including the flexibility to apply separate lanes, which may be appropriate at some locations where bus lanes are provided on hard shoulders.</P>
        <P>Where a bus lane is provided on a hard shoulder area it is a matter for the council of the city or county council concerned to decide if special speed limits arrangements are warranted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 167 together.</P>
        <P>The Government strongly pursued the implementation of its first strategy for road safety 1998-2002. The strategy prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents.</P>
        <P>By the end of the period of the first strategy almost all the measures set out were either fully or partially implemented. During the intervening period between the completion of the first strategy and the introduction of the new strategy, my Department and all the agencies concerned <Col N="1353"/>with the implementation of road safety measures ensured that the successful measures brought forward under the road to safety continued to be implemented.</P>
        <P>The primary target of the first road safety strategy was to achieve a 20% reduction in road deaths and serious injuries, by the end of 2002 compared with 1997 levels. This target was achieved in the case of road deaths and was surpassed in the case of serious injuries.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the number of road deaths in 2004 increased compared to the previous year, when we experienced the lowest number of road deaths in 40 years. The increase experienced in 2004 is a cause for concern. However, this should be considered against the background of significant reductions in road deaths in recent years. It should be noted that the number of road deaths in 2004 is the third lowest figure since 1998, the first full year of the road safety strategy.</P>
        <P>The new road safety strategy 2004-06 outlines a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over that period. In overall terms, measures will continue to focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and sea-belt wearing.</P>
        <P>The primary target of the new Government strategy on road safety is to realise a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998 to 2003 period. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is a very demanding target and its realisation would be a very welcome achievement. My Department, the other Departments and agencies involved in the pursuit of road safety policies will continue to positively promote initiatives aimed at meeting that target. I take particular encouragement in the recent announcement by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the establishment of the traffic corps and the enhancement of enforcement resources this will achieve.</P>
        <P>The overall aim of our road safety policy is to bring our record more into line with experience in the better performing states in the EU and meeting the target established in the road safety strategy will also assist in the achievement of the longer term EU target of a 50% reduction in road deaths across the EU by 2010.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of road traffic legislation, including the implementation of Operation Lifesaver is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The number of road deaths increased over the Christmas and new year period in 2004 compared with 2003 and 2002, when a sharp reduction was experienced immediately after the introduction of penalty points. However, the number of deaths experienced during that period has not reached levels which were regularly experienced before the introduction of penalty points. Between 1998 and 2001, the average number of road deaths in November and December was 36 per month. <Col N="1354"/>Since the introduction of the penalty point system, the average number of deaths during those months was 27.</P>
        <P>Comparisons with the best performing countries in the EU can be made by examining the number of road deaths per 1,000,000 population for 2002, the most recent year for which comparisons are available. The road fatality rate in Ireland in 2002 was 96 per 1 million population, which placed Ireland in seventh place in the European Union, of the 15 member states. The best performing countries are the United Kingdom, Sweden and the Netherlands. The fatality rate in the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands is 61, 60 and 61 fatalities per 1,000,000 population, respectively.</P>

        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2004 establishes that the default speed limit on national roads in rural areas is 100 km/h. This provision came into force on 20 January 2005.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each county or city council to determine whether the default speed limit at any particular location should be replaced through the deployment of a special speed limit. Such determinations are made through the making of special speed limit by-laws by the elected members of the council. Such by-laws are made following consultation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and urban authorities in a county and, in respect of proposals relating to national roads and motorways, the consent, in writing, of the National Roads Authority must be obtained to any changes proposed.</P>

	<P>Electronic toll collection is in use on existing toll plazas and will be used on all future toll schemes. Electronic toll collection does not require legislation for its use. However, the electronic toll collection systems in place use a barrier as the main enforcement tool. Toll operators do not consider the existing legislative arrangements robust enough to support a move to barrier free tolling. My Department is working on proposals for legislative amendments to strengthen the enforcement provisions relating to non-payment of tolls in a barrier free environment.</P>

The Commission intends that compliance with the directive will be mandatory in all member states. Ireland is fully supportive of the proposal. When adopted the directive will become one of the separate directives governing the technical standards for the manufacture, sale and initial entry of service of new vehicles. The directive will be transposed into Irish law by regulations made by the Minister for Transport. The effect of the regulations will be that new vehicles that do not comply with the directive may not be registered in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s report, A Platform for Change, provides the transport planning framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area up to 2016 and is being used by my Department to guide the preparation of a ten year transport investment framework. The Dublin Transportation Office has recently commenced preliminary work on updating A Platform for Change. I have asked my officials to ensure that the Dublin Transportation Office, in undertaking this work, focuses on a vision and strategy for Dublin&rsquo;s transport system beyond 2014, taking full account of those aspects of the ten year transport investment framework that are relevant to the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency has not stood down two of its project teams.

	<P>The taxi hardship payments scheme is based on the recommendations and parameters set out in the taxi hardship panel report, as approved by the Government. The report recommended establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The payments range from &euro;3,000 to &euro;15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved.</P>
        <P>The taxi hardship payments scheme is administered by Area Development Management Limited on behalf of my Department. A total of 1,938 applications have been received by Area Development Management Limited under the scheme. Hardship payments totalling &euro;16,349,000 have been approved in respect of 1,412 qualifying persons under the scheme up to 7 February 2005. The maximum payment in any individual case is &euro;15,000 in accordance with the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. A total of 327 applicants did not qualify for a hardship payment and a further 101 application files have been closed where the applicant did not submit the requisite requested information or docu<Col N="1357"/>mentation to facilitate the consideration of his or her application.</P>
        <P>Remaining applications with Area Development Management Limited will be dealt with in the coming weeks. All cases, with the possible exception of any appeals that may arise, will be considered by end March 2005.

        <P>The original agreement was approved in principle by Government in October 1984 and concluded in October 1987. This was a time when the economic outlook was uncertain and funding for infrastructure development was limited. Against this background, the west link bridge agreement funded the provision, upgrading and maintenance of an important part of national transport infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Traffic volumes have changed substantially since the agreement was concluded and the bridge opened to traffic. Traffic volumes and growth were substantially lower, both when the agreement was concluded and up to the mid-1990s, to what has transpired since the mid-1990s. These factors should be kept in mind in assessing the agreement today.</P>

        <Quest>if he intends, as part of the better regulation process, to introduce legislation along the lines of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Regulatory Reform Act 2001 to enable provision to be made for the purpose of reforming all legislation that has the effect of imposing burdens affecting persons in the carrying out of any activity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2004, the Government published the White Paper, &ldquo;Regulating Better&rdquo;, which commits to six principles of better regulation and outlines an action programme to implement these principles. As I stated in answer to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, on 16 November 2004, a better regulation group of senior officials has been established to oversee implementation of the White Paper and to promote better quality regulation across the public service.</P>
        <P>The White Paper does not provide for the enactment of legislation along the lines of the <Col N="1360"/>United Kingdom&rsquo;s Regulatory Reform Act. However, the White Paper sets out the actions that should be taken with respect to statute law reform and the burdens imposed by regulation. A key element is the Government&rsquo;s initiative to update pre-1922 legislation, which saw the publication last November of the Statute Law Revision Bill. This Bill provides for the repeal of 91 Acts dating from before the foundation of the State. These Acts will be removed as they have been identified as unnecessary. As well as the repeal of legislation, the White Paper provides for the greater use of statute law revision tools such as amendment of existing legislation, consolidation of existing legislation into one Act and restatement of legislation in a more modern form.</P>
        <P>Under the 2002 Statute Law (Restatement) Act, four restatements have been certified to date by the Attorney General and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. These include the Sale of Goods Acts, the Defence Acts, the Tourist Traffic Acts and the Succession Act. Several significant consolidation projects are also under way, including conveyancing, consumer legislation, companies legislation and liquor licensing legislation. These are several examples of the regulatory reform measures under way in the Civil Service. Collectively, the Government&rsquo;s activity in this area will help to improve the accessibility of the Statute Book, reduce the burden of transaction costs on citizens and businesses and improve the efficiency of the public service.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176, 177 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for services to victims of abuse. Accordingly, my Department has requested the chief officer for the executive&rsquo;s primary, community and continuing care area to investigate some of the matters raised and to reply directly to the Deputies.</P>
        <P>In the past, my Department did not directly fund or co-ordinate health and personal social services to victims of abuse. Moneys were made available each year, formerly through the health boards, and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years, funding has increased substantially; more than &euro;12 million is now provided annually for the provision of such services. It is now a matter for the Health Service Executive to resource the provision of these services.</P>
        <P>The national steering committee on violence against women recommended the need for additional sexual assault units should be examined by the Department of Health and Children. I have established a committee under the chairmanship of a senior official of the Department to consider the matter. The committee will be representative of the relevant statutory, voluntary and professional interests and will report to me and to the national steering committee as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I had arranged to have lunch with Ms Angela Smith MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office, on the occasion of her visit to Dublin on 9 December 2004 on other business. Unfortunately, on the day, I was obliged to cancel the lunch appointment as I was scheduled to take Report Stage of the Health Bill 2004 in the D&aacute;&iacute;l. I hope to meet her as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>There is a long history of close contact at the highest level and good relations between my Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Belfast. This relationship was boosted by the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council, which enabled a strategic context to emerge for ministerial oversight, support and drive for advancing the designated areas of health co-operation. These areas include accident and emergency services, planning for major emergencies, high technology equipment, cancer research and health promotion. Work continues in these areas towards identifying actions and measures to improve planning, efficiency and service from an all-island perspective. A recent meeting at Secretary General level reviewed progress under each of these headings.</P>
        <P>Practical co-operation between health authorities on both sides of the Border has always been an operational fact of life. A major force and focus for this co-operation is the co-operation and working together project, a cross-Border initiative. Co-operation and working together is an invaluable catalyst for joint working in the Border area. It is ideally placed to identify, initiate and implement proposals for future service development. My Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety recognise the force for joint working represented by Co-operation. Working together we are committed to ensuring the progress of Co-operation and working together. Examples of co-operation at the wider North-South level are the work of the Food Safety Promotion Board and joint initiatives in nursing and midwifery and in specialist medical training rotation schemes. I look forward to the continuation of close working contacts with our Northern Ireland counterparts.</P>

	<P>Following receipt of legal advice on the matter, my Department issued an instruction to each former health board on 9 December 2004 to cease imposing any charges on fully eligible individuals in receipt of in-patient services in the public long-stay care facilities in question with effect from that date. The Health Service Executive, responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services since 1 January 2005, has advised that the former chief executive officers of all health boards instructed staff to comply with this directive.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has reported that where it has been authorised to act as the patient&rsquo;s agent when dealing with the patient&rsquo;s pension payments, weekly spending money is paid to each patient and the balance of such patient&rsquo;s pension is lodged to his or her patient private property account, from where it is accessible to the patient. With regard to the matter of the return of the pension book to patients, it is important that the process of altering the existing arrangements be carried out in an appropriate manner. Accordingly, the Health Service Executive has indicated that it is issuing a letter to all patients who have authorised it to act as their agent, offering them choices with regard to their pension books, and that arrangements will be made to return the pension books to the patients in question if that is their choice. Some patients may not be in a position to make a decision regarding their arrangements and the process will have to involve the patient&rsquo;s next of kin. This matter will be dealt with by each nursing home or institution and, so, there will be an opportunity to discuss the matter with the relevant local staff.</P><Col N="1367"/>
        <P>The Health Service Executive is working conjointly with the Department of Social and Family Affairs in this regard. The emphasis is on ensuring that a choice is given to those who are in a position to exercise it and to ensure that the best interest of the patient is maintained at all times.</P>

Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for orthodontic services.</P>
        <P>Several measures have been adopted to improve orthodontic services in the Health Service Executive mid-western area and on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the orthodontic service. In 2003, my Department and the former health boards funded 19 dentists from various health board areas for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 19 trainees for the public orthodontic service include six dentists who successfully completed their training in September 2004 and have taken up duties with the Health Service Executive. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of <Col N="1368"/>an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</P>
        <P>The commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at the Cork Dental School. This appointment at the school will facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The Department has given approval in principle to a proposal to further substantially improve training facilities for orthodontics at the school, which will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region, including the mid-western area, under the leadership of the professor of orthodontics.</P>

        <P>I welcome the recent Pollack report commissioned by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland on the treatment of cystic fibrosis in Ireland. The Health Service Executive, which has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services, recently met with the association and has agreed to its request to establish a working group to consider the recommendations in the report.</P>
        <P>The report provides an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients and makes a number of recommendations with regard to numbers and types of staff appropriate for a modern, multi-disciplinary cystic fibrosis service. The report concludes that in the future it will be essential to base cystic fibrosis care in fewer units of a more significant size in order to sustain viable staffing levels and to ensure that staff have <Col N="1371"/>a sufficient workload to enable them to maintain their skills level.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Health Service Executive is pursuing with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, which is designated as the national adult cystic fibrosis centre, proposals for improvement to the physical infrastructure to support the highly professional treatment and care services provided there at the moment.</P>

        <P>Following a further meeting held on the 1 February 2005 between the Health Service Executive north east and St. John of God north east services, it was agreed to use the existing joint partnership forum to develop a strategy on how best to continue the implementation of the 2002 report to address the outstanding priority concerns regarding health and safety issues and critical staffing levels at St. Mary&rsquo;s residential services.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, St. John of God north east services has undertaken to defer the decision around the suspension of respite service provision in St. Mary&rsquo;s. The Health Service Executive north east disability services and St. John of God north east services will arrange to keep parent rep<Col N="1373"/>resentatives abreast of developments in the process.

Under the Act the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the funding of the Ballymun health centre, including the fit-out and equipping of the facility.</P>
        <P>The former Eastern Health Board and its successors the former Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Northern Area Health Board, in conjunction with Ballymun Regeneration Limited &mdash; a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dublin City Council &mdash; proceeded with the development of Ballymun primary care centre in the absence of my Department&rsquo;s involvement or approval. Consequently, my Department was obliged to conduct a review of this project, which primarily centred on issues relating to procurement and funding. The responses received over a period of time from the ERHA were examined in detail by my Department. Account had also to be taken of legal opinion received in relation to procurement issues. It is only recently that, bearing in mind all the circumstances of the case, my Department was in a position to recommend sanction for the HSE to proceed with the fit-out of the centre.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that my Department was not responsible for any unnecessary delay in progressing this project, given the various concerns involved. I am advised that the fit-out will not be phased but will be carried out under a single construction contract. In fact I have indicated that I wish the project to be opened as quickly as it logistically can.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated, the HSE is responsible for the funding and delivery of this project. Accordingly, I have asked the chief officer of the Executive&rsquo;s eastern regional area to examine the funding and other issues raised and reply directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 230 to 236, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for the delivery of drug treatment services. I have no comment to make in relation to matters arising from grievance procedures and sick leave protocols which are clearly a matter for individuals and their employers.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the chief executive of the HSE that general practitioner co-ordinators were appointed in 1997 by the then Eastern Health Board on the basis of their experience in the treatment of drug misuse at the time. The purpose of the posts is to oversee drug treatment services and specifically the development of methadone services.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the HSE that there are currently five GP co-ordinators in post, all of whom are approved, accredited and audited general practitioners with expertise in the treatment of opiate users. They report to the assistant chief officer with responsibility for addiction in each of the HSE areas in the east. Continuing medical training is a necessary requirement for the co-ordinators to maintain their accreditation. The co-ordinators are employed on a sessional basis and are not precluded from engaging in other work. I understand from the HSE that the co-ordinators are paid on a sessional basis which currently equates to &euro;65.37 per hour.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the national GP co-ordinator was also appointed by the then Eastern Health Board with the agreement of the Department of <Col N="1382"/>Health and Children to provide additional clinical support and advice to areas outside the then eastern region. I am not aware of any specific plan to review the titles and work practices of GP co-ordinators in the drug misuse field, although the operation of the methadone protocol is reviewed by an implementation committee on an ongoing basis and the roles and functions of different service providers are routinely considered in that context. At the end of December 2004, there were 316 GPs involved in the methadone protocol.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 256 and 272 together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the interdepartmental review group which was established to review the scheme. It examined all aspects of the scheme, including qualifying medical criteria, benefits and the appeals process. The report of the group was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in July 2004 and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
        <P>Following the report&rsquo;s recommendations concerning the appeals process, amendments to the regulations governing the scheme were made to improve the operation of the appeals process. These were signed by the Minister for Finance on 23 July 2004. These amendments provided for an expansion of the panel of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal from three to five. The appeals process was amended <Col N="1389"/>by the introduction of a six-month waiting period between an appeal and subsequent application, and the introduction of the requirement for a second or subsequent application to be certified by a registered medical practitioner to the effect that there has been material disimprovement in the medical condition since the previous application.</P>
        <P>Given the scale and scope of the scheme, further changes can only be made after careful consideration. For this reason, the Government has decided that the Minister for Finance will consider the recommendations contained in the report of the interdepartmental review group in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Minister of Agriculture and Food that under the EU sugar regime, which comes within the remit of that Minister, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer here. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specific tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.</P>
        <P>I understand that in 2000 an arrangement was put in place by Irish Sugar Limited and the Irish Farmers Association, whereby a grower who was offered a beet growing contract for the 2000 to 2001 growing season could nominate another grower to take the contract subject to the agreement of Irish Sugar Limited. I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that any payments between growers in respect of such nominations were payments of a revenue nature in the <Col N="1390"/>hands of the payer, and, as such, are eligible to be deducted in calculating the payer&rsquo;s income for tax purposes in the basis period in which the payment is written off in the payer&rsquo;s accounts. The payments were capital receipts in the hands of the recipient and chargeable to capital gains tax.</P>
        <P>It should be understood that any such payments were unrelated to quota, since there is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level, but were private arrangements between individual growers in respect of nominations for sugar beet growing contracts.</P>

Telecommunications services including phones are subject to the standard rate of VAT at 21%. The supply of electricity and gas is subject to the reduced VAT rate of 13.5%. There is no provision in European VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply, that allows the application of an exemption from VAT for supplies to customers over the age of 80.</P><Col N="1392"/>
        <P>However, under the social welfare code, any person resident in the State who is aged 70 or more is entitled to the social welfare household benefits package, subject to certain conditions and regardless of income or household composition. This package comprises an electricity or natural gas or bottle gas allowance, a telephone allowance, and a free television licence.</P>
        <P>The electricity allowance covers the normal standing charge and up to 1,800 units of electricity each year. At current prices, the value of the electricity allowance to the consumer is approximately &euro;339 per annum for urban dwellers, and &euro;381 for rural dwellers, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. Alternatively, if the natural gas allowance option is selected, the customer is entitled to the supply charge and up to 1,674 kwh of gas per year. The annual value of this is up to &euro;250 per annum, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%. If the person&rsquo;s home is not connected to an electricity or natural gas supply, the person is entitled to 15 cylinders of bottle gas per annum at an annual value of approximately &euro;320, inclusive of VAT at 13.5%.</P>
        <P>The telephone allowance is paid as a credit on the customer&rsquo;s telephone bill. The value of the allowance is &euro;24.70 per month, including VAT, or &euro;296.40 per annum.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 264 and 265 together.</P>
        <P>The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero-rated before 1 January 1991, the goods and services referred to by the Deputy do not fall within this category. Similarly, member states may only apply a reduced VAT rate to those goods and services set out in annexe H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive. Safety equipment is not included in this annexe. Therefore, it is not possible to apply a zero or reduced VAT rate to these goods and services.</P>
        <P>However, fishermen who are registered for VAT are entitled to claim a refund for all VAT charged to them in respect of equipment used for their business. Fishermen who are not registered for VAT are entitled to claim in respect of certain inputs, under section 29, regarding remission or <Col N="1393"/>repayment of tax on fishing vessels and equipment, of the 1979 VAT regulations. In the case of safety equipment, the inputs included are anchors, autopilots, bilge and deck pumps, buoys, floats, compasses, life boats and life rafts, marine lights, radar apparatus, radio navigational aid apparatus, radio telephones, provided the vessel concerned has been the subject of a grant or loan from Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>In addition, the Value-Added Tax (Refund of Tax)(No. 18) Order 1985 provides for the repayment of VAT, subject to certain conditions, incurred in respect of equipment for use in rescue or assistance at sea. Furthermore, the 1973 Finance Act provided for the zero-rating of &ldquo;life saving services provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, including the organisation and maintenance of the lifeboat service&rdquo;. This means that while the RNLI does not charge VAT on the services it provides, it is entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on the goods and services which it purchases in delivering those services.</P>
        <P>The Irish Coast Guard, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, administers the community Inland and inshore rescue services grant scheme. The Community of Inshore Rescue Services and the Inland Rescue Service may apply for grants under the scheme in respect of both current and, more recently, capital expenditures. Guidelines on the scheme in terms of eligibility criteria and grant levels are available from the Irish Coast Guard.</P>

	<P>The Dublin coastal protection project, which is being carried out by Dublin City <Col N="1394"/>Council and part-funded by OPW, is a study examining the causes and impacts of flooding from Portmarnock to Booterstown. A draft report is being finalised and the OPW expects to receive it shortly for detailed consideration. OPW officials have recently met with the council and have discussed some of the recommendations highlighted in advance of the completed report.</P>
        <P>Dublin City Council has indicated that proposals for improved sea defences in the Clontarf area will be contained in the report and that this area is high on the council&rsquo;s priority list. The OPW indicated its commitment to this process and will examine requests for funding when more details are available. It is understood that flood defence proposals in the report are estimated to cost &euro;100 million. Any such requests for funding must to be carefully considered in the context of the OPW&rsquo;s annual budget for flood relief projects of &euro;20 million approximately, and the large amount of flood alleviation projects currently being advanced by OPW.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 273 and 274 together.</P>
        <P> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their office in Mullingar will continue to operate as a revenue office. However, following the successful introduction of on-line vehicle <Col N="1396"/>registration through the ROS, revenue on-line service, the demand for direct customer contact services at vehicle registration offices has declined substantially. In 2003, for example, 55% of new vehicles nationally were registered on-line. By January 2005, that percentage had risen to more than 86%.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have recently reviewed the implications of these changes in vehicle registration practices. As a result of their review, and having regard to the reduction in customer services demand at the vehicle registration office in Mullingar, they have decided to consolidate the provision of vehicle registration and associated services for counties Westmeath and Offaly at their office in Tullamore from March. I understand this decision has no implications for the continuance of a revenue office in Mullingar and that staff at the office will be assigned to other duties and will not be relocated.</P>
        <P>This is in the context of a national review of the implications of a declining service demand for front-line VRO services which is leading to consolidation of service provision across the country. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that affected staff are being assigned to other duties and will not be involuntarily relocated.</P>
        <P>There are four full-time staff, comprising two executive officers, one clerical officer and one service officer, assigned to the revenue office in Mullingar. Two of these staff are engaged in the provision of vehicle registration and other associated services, a third official is engaged on unrelated debt management duties and the fourth is assigned to excise control.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>VAT rates are governed by the EU Sixth VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law must comply. Member states may only grant a VAT exemption to activities listed under Article 13 of this directive. Therefore, the introduction of new exempt activities does not arise. In general, these exemptions are transposed by the first Schedule to the VAT Act 1972, as amended.</P>
        <P>Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991, but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services. It is possible to move existing zero-rated items to either the reduced rate or the standard rate. However, once moved, it is not possible to revert them to the zero rate.</P>
        <P>Member states may apply up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5% to supplies of goods and services listed in annexe H of the EU <Col N="1397"/>Sixth VAT Directive. Ireland operates a single reduced rate of VAT of 13.5%. The goods and services in annexe H include certain foods, non-oral medicines, supply, construction and alteration of housing provided as part of a social policy, and newspapers and periodicals. Goods and services at the reduced rate may be moved to the standard rate, but only those listed in annexe H may be reverted from the standard rate to the reduced rate.</P>
        <P>As regards the VAT rate structure, any changes made by member states must comply with the EU Sixth VAT Directive. Member states have the option of retaining the zero VAT rates which were in force on 1 January 1991 but no new zero VAT rates can be introduced. As a transitional arrangement, member states may maintain, at a reduced rate of not less than 12%, any items not listed in annexe H, provided such items were at a reduced rate on 1 January 1991. These goods and services are considered to be &ldquo;parked&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In addition, member states may have up to two reduced VAT rates of not less than 5% for a specified number of goods or services which are set out in annexe H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive. Member states may not set the standard VAT rate lower than 15% and there is political agreement that the standard rate applying in each member state may not exceed 25%. Ireland&rsquo;s standard rate of VAT is 21%.</P>
        <P>I hope this clarifies the European legislative framework which governs Irish VAT law.</P>

	<P>The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable rural post office network as set out in the programme for Government. The overarching objective continues to be the retention of post offices services, in as many locations as possible, in the manner which best meets consumer needs, whether via post offices, postal agencies or the PostPoint network.</P>
        <P>It may be helpful to illustrate the current strength of the network. There are 1,000 automated post offices, 475 non-automated post offices and 160 postal agencies. Furthermore, An Post has established 3,000 PostPoint outlets in retail premises, of which 600 can be used for bill payment.</P>
        <P>The future of the post office network has been subject to a number of studies and reviews in recent years and many of the recommendations <Col N="1398"/>have been implemented, including the provision in 2003 of Government equity, amounting to some &euro;12.7 million to assist with the modernisation process. The post office network has a high volume of people passing through the premises, a recognised brand name and a countrywide retail network. The priority for all stakeholders is to build on these strengths to maintain and increase the amount of business conducted through the network in order to secure its future.</P>
        <P>There is widespread recognition that the best development strategy to sustain the network is for An Post to continue adapting to its customer needs within the financial constraints in which it now finds itself. As part of this strategy, An Post has secured additional business for the network, including bill pay facilities for the ESB and<?oasys _jy?>Barclays Bank credit cards, telephone top-ups through its PostPoint service and a contract with the AIB under which the bank&rsquo;s customers can access their accounts through the network. Further opportunities from both the public and private sectors are being actively explored by the company with a view to bringing on stream additional services, at the post office counter where possible.</P>
        <P>The long-term future of the post office network can only be secured by meeting the demands of customers. In this regard, I have asked the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to securing existing business and pursuing new business opportunities at every opportunity. As outlined above, that strategy is being followed with some success.</P>
        <P>I have had no discussions with the European Commission regarding the social welfare payments contract between An Post and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Any such discussions are a matter for that Department.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. Arising from this commitment, a number of reports, including the Flynn report, have examined modernisation of the network to provide a range of products and introduce service delivery channels which meet consumer needs. Key recommendations have either been implemented or continue to be addressed as part of the long-term strategy to secure the future of the post office network.</P>
        <P>Following receipt of the Flynn report, the Government moved to underpin its commitment to the post office network by approving an equity <Col N="1399"/>injection of &euro;12.7 million for An Post to facilitate the modernisation of the network. This was paid to the company in 2003. Increased postmaster scale payment remuneration has also been granted and the requirement to address the structure of such remuneration is the subject of ongoing discussions between the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post. Initiatives are under way to implement necessary restructuring of the post office network itself. In particular, non-automated sub-post offices are being converted to postal agencies offering an appropriate range of services, in particular social welfare payments and the sale of stamps.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, and of particular importance, An Post continues to pursue new business opportunities for the network. Additional business won includes bill paying facilities for the ESB and Barclays Bank credit cards, telephone top-ups through its PostPoint service, and a notable flagship contract with the AIB under which the bank&rsquo;s customers can access their accounts through the post office network. Further opportunities from both the public and private sectors are being actively explored by the company with a view to bringing on stream additional services, at the post office counter wherever possible. An Post, with my Department&rsquo;s support, is also taking steps to ensure that it successfully retains existing core business, particularly in the fields of social welfare payments and savings services.</P>
        <P>The Flynn report emphasised the need for the parties to explore avenues whereby the network can adapt to current and future realities. In this regard, there has been a clear recognition on all sides that the long-term future of the post office network can only be secured by meeting the needs of customers. Accordingly, I have asked the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership with a view to realising the twin goals of securing existing business and pursuing new business opportunities as they arise. As outlined above, that strategy is being followed with some success.</P>

	<P>By virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Orders 2002, public service obligations which relate to electricity generation have been imposed on ESB with effect from 1 January 2003 in the interests of security of supply and environmental protection. All PSO orders require the approval of the European Commission. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the PSO levy arrangements and certifying the additional costs incurred by ESB in accordance with the terms of the PSO order.</P>
        <P>The PSO levy is imposed on three categories of electricity account holders so that each category pays a percentage of the levy in each year in proportion to its share of the maximum system demand, as determined each year by the CER. This results in a total PSO levy for each category which is then applied to individual account holders within each category so that, for instance, domestic and small account holders pay a standard charge per electricity bill while medium and large account holders pay on the basis of a standard charge per kVA of maximum import capacity. Adoption of this approach will not result in any cross-subsidisation between the categories as the &ldquo;percentage of total system capacity&rdquo; allocates the total PSO levy in a consistent non-discriminatory way across all categories.</P>
        <P>In regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s request for statistical information, my Department is endeavouring to compile the information in conjunction with the CER. It has not been possible within the constraints of time and available resources to source the information. Such data as is available will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The universal service obligation, which includes nationwide postal delivery requirements, is enshrined in EU and Irish law and is a statutory requirement for An Post, as the designated universal service provider. Furthermore, the European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations 2002, establish the area of the postal market solely reserved for universal service providers and this reserved area assists An Post to fulfil its universal service obligations.</P>
        <P>In regard to the post office network, the Government has already provided significant funding by way of a &euro;12.7 million equity investment in 2003 to support modernisation of the network. The network also benefits from significant contracts with the Department of Social and Family Affairs for social welfare payments and the National Treasury Management Agency for Government savings products.</P>
        <P>It is not envisaged that further public funding will be provided to An Post. The best way to sustain the post office and postal delivery networks is to gear the networks to provide a range of products and services which meet consumer needs. Part of the challenge at this point is for An Post unions and management to agree and implement a change programme to allow necessary restructuring to take place.</P>

	<P>Dingle Harbour operates under the 1946 Harbours Act whereby commissioners are appointed to manage the port. Dingle Harbour commissioners have sought designation of Dingle as a fishery harbour centres, so as to rank among the fishery harbour centres, which are 100% funded by the Exchequer, to which the Fishery Harbour Centre Acts 1968 to 1998 apply. The designated fishery harbour centres are Howth, Dunmore East, Castletownbere, Rossaveel and Killybegs. Such designation for Dingle Harbour is under consideration and no decision has been made to date.</P>
        <P>In 2004, funding of &euro;201,000 was provided for dredging site investigation works and &euro;86,000 for a weighbridge at Dingle Harbour. The question of funding works at Dingle Harbour will depend <Col N="1402"/>on the amount of funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities into the future. My officials met with the board in 2004 to discuss these and other matters and will be happy to do so again.</P>
        <P>The national development plan sets out the programme objectives for fishery harbour development. These are the development and construction of fishery harbour and related facilities at key strategic fishery harbours and the construction and improvement of berthage at smaller harbours and landing places. The plan provides &euro;84.35 million for capital investment in fishery harbours infrastructure and facilities over the period 2000 to 2006. Up to the end of 2004, the Department has spent &euro;98.58 million under this programme.</P>
        <P>The total allocation for 2005 is &euro;20.55 million. This includes funding for various projects, including the upgrading and modernisation of Port Oriel, Clogherhead, which is owned by Louth County Council and for which the council will contribute 25% of the cost; the development of the Dinish Wharf extension and the provision of a suitable harbour services building on the extension; the development of new ferry berths at Rossaveel fishery harbour centre, for which funding is provided jointly with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and the development options at Dunmore East fishery harbour centre.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 285 together.</P>
        <P>It is important to set out the background to the issues arising for the scallop fishing sector. The main scallop fishery has traditionally been off the south-east coast of Ireland and fishing effort has been increasing since the mid-1990s. There are serious concerns about the state of the scallop stock in Irish waters where fishing effort and fishing mortality is regarded as too high and unsustainable. The Irish scallop fleet in the recent past has moved from these traditional fisheries to prosecute the scallop fishery in the English Channel.</P>
        <P>At EU level, ceilings on fishing effort were first established in 1996, in the context of the management of fishing effort for western waters. During the review of the western waters fishing effort regime in 2003, new fishing effort ceilings were <Col N="1404"/>established for this fishery based, as for all other fisheries, on the average of the fishing effort levels for the reference period 1998 to 2002, inclusive. This established a fishing effort ceiling for the scallop fishery of 109,395 kwdays inside the biologically sensitive area, new Irish Box, and 525,012 kwdays for the rest of Area VII.</P>
        <P>During the period of implementation of the previous western waters regime, the focus was primarily on the management of fishing effort targeting whitefish stocks. Under the new regime for western waters, member states are required to take active measures to ensure that the ceilings established for all the fisheries with effort ceilings applied under the regulations are fully respected. It should also be noted that, following concerns expressed about the increased level of fishing effort on scallops being deployed in the English Channel, the Commission has committed to bringing forward specific conservation measures, including fishing effort limitations for the scallop stocks in the English Channel. Any such measures are likely to impact on the Irish scallop fishery in the Channel.</P>
        <P>The Irish scallop fleet has been increasing fishing effort over the period between 1998 to 2002, and 2003 saw a substantial increase in effort over 2002. The level of effort available for 2005 for the Irish fleet is accordingly less than the recent level of fishing effort deployed in the fishery. My officials have held detailed meetings, the most recent on 4 February 2005, with the representative organisation for the scallop fishermen to review the fishery and consider options for effective management. I informally met the industry representatives and scallop fishermen last Friday, 11 February and heard their concerns.</P>
        <P>In the coming days, I will review the outcome of these meetings and will considering the options available to me. I intend to hold a further meeting with industry representatives shortly with a view to finding a way forward that will ensure that the EU effort limits are respected while providing for a sustainable scallop fishery into the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003 transferred responsibility for the licens<Col N="1405"/>ing of sea-fishing boats from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Licensing Authority for Sea-Fishing Boats which operates on an independent basis subject to criteria set out in that Act. The licensing authority implements general licensing policy in accordance with policy directives issued by the Minister. The head of the licensing authority is the registrar general of fishing boats, a senior official in the Department.</P>
        <P>Sea-fishing boat licences are issued on a fleet segment basis rather than for individual species such as scallops. The segment in respect of which a licence is issued does, however, broadly determine the species for which vessels may fish. Under national licensing policy, the Irish fleet is categorised into five fleet segments. these are the pelagic segment, which comprises tank boats which fish for pelagic species, such as herring, mackerel and horse mackerel; the polyvalent segment, comprising multi-purpose vessels which can fish for demersal and shellfish species, and, unless specifically precluded, for pelagic species; the beam trawl segment, made up of beam trawlers which fish for bottom-dwelling species; the specific segment, comprising vessels which can only fish for aquaculture or bivalve shellfish species; and the aquaculture segment, involving vessels which are solely engaged in aquaculture.</P>
        <P>While sea-fishing boat licences for fleet segments other than the aquaculture segment do not preclude vessels from fishing for scallops, it is understood that, in practice, the owners of vessels proposing to predominantly engage in this form of fishing apply to have their boats licensed in the specific segment. Fishermen wishing to have the scope to fish for a broader range of species than scallops, or other bivalve shellfish species, have their boats licensed in the polyvalent segment.</P>
        <P>The licensing authority informs me that it has, within the past three months, issued one new sea-fishing boat licence for the specific segment and 18 such licences for the polyvalent segment. It further advises that a number of amended or renewal licences were issued over this period but a precise figure is not readily available. The purpose of issuing these licences did not specifically relate to scallop fishing but to general issues such as vessel re-measurement and updating of vessels&rsquo; data. Some existing licensed vessels which have complied with a code of practice relating to vessel safety had the period of validity of their licences extended. I understand that a general renewal of sea-fishing boat licences is due to take place before the end of June next, when the vast majority of current licences will expire.</P>
        <P>At EU level, ceilings on fishing effort were first established in 2003 based, as for all other fisheries, on the average of the fishing effort levels for the reference period 1998 to 2002, inclusive. The Irish scallop fleet has been increasing fishing effort over the period 1998-2002, and 2003 saw a substantial increase in effort over 2002. The level of effort available for 2005 for the Irish fleet is <Col N="1406"/>accordingly less than the recent level of fishing effort deployed in the fishery. My officials have held detailed meetings, the most recent on 4 February 2005, with the representative organisation for the scallop fishermen to review the fishery and consider options for effective management. I informally met the industry representatives and scallop fishermen last Friday, 11 February and heard their concerns.</P>

	<P>Issues relating to visa requirements for foreign visitors to Ireland are a matter in the first instance for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. From a tourism perspective, the impact of separate British visa requirements on tourists wishing to travel across the Border with Northern Ireland is negligible given that the level of tourism business to the island of Ireland from countries which are subject to such special visa requirements is minimal at this point in time.</P>

	<P>The legal metrology service of the National Standards Authority of Ireland operates under the aegis of my Department and implements the provisions of the Metrology Acts 1980 to 1998. One of the objectives of the legislation is to ensure fair trade and consumer protection by checking the accuracy of measuring instruments used in trade throughout the economy. The law imposes obligations on traders to ensure that the measuring instruments they use in trade are of an approved type and have been verified by the legal metrology service.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Metrology Act 1996, as amended, provides that the National Standards Authority of Ireland may, with the consent of the Minister, charge fees for, <i>inter alia</i>, verification services. When considering the basis for a fee increase in the latter part of 2004, the board of the authority was of the view that the fee set <Col N="1411"/>should be such as to fully recover the costs associated with the verification process. To enable full cost recovery, the board proposed an increase in the verification fee for taximeters from &euro;32 to &euro;75, excluding VAT, and ministerial consent was granted for this increase.</P>
        <P>The fee increase was advertised in the national press on 13 November 2004 and came into effect on 22 November 2004. The rate reflects the fact that the provision of these services to the taxi industry and the application of metrology law is both a personnel and equipment intensive operation.</P>

        <P>National car testing centres, as in the case of all other workplaces, are subject to occupational safety and health legislation and are liable to inspection by the Health and Safety Authority, in accordance with its prioritised programme of work and standard operational procedures.</P>
        <P>The methods used for the inspection of workplaces depend on a range of factors including the nature of the inspection visit, that is whether it is a routine inspection, a follow-up inspection, the investigation of an accident, investigation of a <Col N="1414"/>complaint etc. In the course of inspections, inspectors speak to managers, safety officers and, where available, worker safety representatives. Follow-up action includes both verbal and written advice and, where necessary, the issuing of enforcement notices. Where an inspector issues a formal enforcement direction or notice, this is generally copied to the site safety representative for information.</P>
        <P>Monitoring of the workplace atmosphere as it relates to potential for exposure to hazardous chemical agents is covered by the Chemical Agents Regulations 2001. The regulations require employers to identify the hazards arising, assess the risks and put in place appropriate control measures. As part of the risk assessment it may be necessary for the employer to establish, or have established on his or her behalf, the levels of chemical agents being emitted in the workplace atmosphere. Following the risk assessment, it may be necessary for employees to undergo health surveillance of which records are required to be kept.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 58 and 59 of 12 October 2004, the various Seveso establishments that have produced the requisite safety report in accordance with Article 9 of Council Directive 96/82/EC, together with the date each such establishment complied with the said article; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances has been transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 476 of 2000), as amended by the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances)(Amendment) Regulations 2003 &mdash; SI 402 of 2003. A further directive, 2003/105/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, is due to be transposed into Irish law by 1 July 2005.</P>
        <P>The directive and transposition regulations require that a safety report be produced if the inventory of dangerous substances exceeds stated thresholds in Annexe 1 of the directive. The report must address in detail: the nature of the establishment and its surrounding environment; the character of the dangerous substances and their processing; the extent and severity of potential major accidents; emergency planning; and the company&rsquo;s safety management system. The production of such reports often requires the use by a company of external specialist expertise to conduct the necessary consequence and risk assessment.</P><Col N="1415"/>
        <P>The following table shows the dates that safety reports were received from the various establishments that are, or were, subject to the requirement to produce a safety report. Following their receipt they have been subject to a detailed assessment and additional information or clarification has been sought as necessary. Safety reports have not been requested from those <Col N="1416"/>establishments, which will no longer be top tier sites when Directive 2003/105/EC comes into force; this is required of the member states before 1 July 2005. The basis for this decision was that by the time the reports would have been produced and evaluated the relevant establishments would have been close to or already outside the legal requirement for such a report.</P><Col N="1415"/>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The current law on safety in the workplace is set out in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989. Section 7 of that Act imposes a general duty on employers to conduct their undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in their <Col N="1416"/>employment who may be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their safety or health.</P>
        <P>This law is now due to be updated by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Bill 2004. Section 12 of that Bill carries over the general duty on employers to persons other than their employees. The Bill will also maintain, in Section 20, the requirement of every employer to have a safety statement, based on an identification of hazards and a risk assessment, setting out the manner in which the safety, health and welfare at work of his or her employees will be secured and managed.</P>
        <P>Under the Bill, employers will be required to bring the safety statement to the attention of his or her employees and other persons at the place of work who may be exposed to any specific risk to which the safety statement applies. Where specific tasks are being performed at a place of work that pose a serious risk to safety, health or welfare, an employer will be required to bring to the attention of those affected by that risk relevant extracts of the safety statement setting out: <Col N="1417"/>the risk identified; the risk assessment; and the protective and preventive measures taken regarding that risk.</P>
        <P>In that regard, a place of work is defined in section 2(1) of the Bill. The definition states: &lsquo;place of work&rsquo; includes any, or any part of any, place (whether or not within or forming part of a building or structure), land or other location at, in, upon or near which, work is carried on whether occasionally or otherwise, etc.</P>

It is the practice of F&Aacute;S to provide a standard payment to sponsors of CE projects. This is based on the number of participants and supervisors. In addition, a contribution is given towards the costs of materials and the personal development and training of participants.</P>

The southern region of the executive has advised that the person concerned was refused rent supplement on the grounds that he had deprived himself of income, which would have enabled him to provide for his rent from within his own resources. The person concerned has been unsuccessful in appealing against this decision to the executive&rsquo;s appeals officer.</P>
        <P>At the request of the person concerned, the decision in his case has been referred to the social welfare appeals office for review by an appeals officer. I understand that an oral hearing in this case is expected to take place in early March. Decisions and appeals on individual claims are dealt with by designated officers in the Health Service Executive or the social welfare appeals office where appropriate and I have no function in this regard.</P>

He appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office and in the context of his appeal he was examined by another medical assessor who was also of the opinion that he did not satisfy the relevant medical eligibility criteria. Following an <Col N="1419"/>oral hearing the appeals officer, having considered all the available evidence, was not satisfied that the person is substantially handicapped to the degree that would prevent him from undertaking suitable employment. Notification of the decision has issued to the person concerned. Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances. There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the household concerned. Account is also taken of the availability of an alternative source to meet the need, for example, entitlements or relevant services from other state agencies.</P>
        <P>The type of assistance referred to by the Deputy is appropriate to the ambulance service, which operates in each of the Health Service Executive regions. This service is funded to provide transport, including the hiring of taxis if necessary, to bring patients and clients to and from hospital appointments.</P>
        <P>In response to various enquiries from the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive from time to time regarding this matter, the advice by my Department has been that it is not appropriate that the supplementary welfare allowance scheme be used to supplement or substitute for ambulance or related hospital transport services. This remains the position. This advice does not affect the general discretion available to community welfare officers to issue an exceptional needs payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation, which might arise.</P>

	<P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned has not sub<Col N="1420"/>mitted an application for fuel allowance. The person concerned does not qualify for the allowance as the total weekly income of her household exceeds the qualifying income threshold, which in her case, is &euro;374.99 per week.</P>
        <P>The person concerned is a qualified adult on her husband&rsquo;s old age contributory pension and their current weekly rate of payment is &euro;165.40 comprising &euro;96.10 personal rate and &euro;69.30 qualified adult allowance. Her husband also has income from an occupational pension of &euro;16,884 per year in 2003, which is &euro;324.69 per week, giving a total household income of &euro;490.09 per week.</P>
        <P>If the person concerned has special heating needs and is unable to provide for those needs, she may qualify for a heating payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. A heating supplement is available under that scheme for people who require extra heating in their homes because of ill health or infirmity. An application for this supplement may be made through her local community welfare officer.</P>

	<P>The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity or gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes is generally available to people living permanently in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who fulfil a means test. The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.</P>
        <P>To be eligible for the schemes a person who is under 70 years of age must, as well as receiving a qualifying payment, be living alone or with an excepted person. In this regard, a child under 18 or, if in full-time education, 22, is regarded as an excepted person. However, an adult or child who is in employment is not regarded as an excepted person for the purpose of the schemes, and this is considered to be a reasonable approach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the <Col N="1421"/>person may have, together with the value of capital and property, except the home. Capital may include the following: stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value; savings certificates, bonds, national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value; and money invested in a bank, building society etc.</P>
        <P>The source of any capital held by a pensioner can and does vary. It can include savings from income while formerly working, savings derived from the sale of property or other assets, savings from occupational or social welfare pensions, gifts, inheritances, accumulated interest or dividends or a combination of these. It would not be possible or practicable to distinguish savings derived from a particular source.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of old age non-contributory pension, an initial amount of capital has always been disregarded for means test purposes. This amount was £200 up to 1997 and was increased to £2,000 in that year. In October 2000, the disregard was substantially increased to £10,000. Last October, I requested my Department to carry out a comprehensive examination of the current arrangements for the assessment of capital, particularly in so far as they apply to SSIAs, with a view to bringing forward proposals in budget 2005. On budget day, I was pleased to announce that the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all schemes, except supplementary welfare allowance, will be increased from &euro;12,694.38 to 420,000, an increase of more than 47,300. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital regardless of where it is held, be it in an SSIA, a credit union, with An Post or any other account with a bank or other financial institution.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements will mean that a single non-contributory pensioner, with no other means, can have capital of up to &euro;28,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple. As a consequence of the increases in the capital disregards in 2000 and, now in 2005, the capital disregard has increased at a rate significantly ahead of increases in the weekly rates. Since 1980, the weekly rate of old age non-contributory pension has increased by approximately 520% while the capital disregard has increased by nearly 8,000%.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements announced by me on budget day are designed to ensure that social welfare means testing arrangements do not act as a disincentive to claimants to become savers or penalise those who have been regular savers in the past.</P>

	<P>Subject to certain conditions, rent supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>The legislation governing rent supplements precludes payments being made to defray the cost of maintenance of, or repairs to, a dwelling for which, in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the tenant would be liable. Neither is rent supplement payable in respect of management charges for services such as gardening, window cleaning or general upkeep, which might apply to a tenancy.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme also provides for exceptional needs payments to be made at the discretion of the community welfare service to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in individual situations of need. In general it is not appropriate for an exceptional needs payment to be made to a tenant in respect of normal recurring management charges for an apartment. However, it is open to the community welfare service to assist if necessary in the specific circumstances of an individual case, particularly if an unforeseen charge arises, which would cause hardship.</P>

	<P>It is Government policy to encourage as wide a range as possible of safe, reliable and competitive air services to and from Ireland. The central tenet of this policy is the belief that strong, competitive and efficient networks of air links are vitally important for developing our trade and tourism sectors, particularly having regard to our island status and peripheral location.</P>
        <P>The operation of air services within Europe has been totally liberalised by the EU and this has ensured that fares, routes and frequency of services operated by carriers, including Irish carriers, are entirely commercial decisions for each company. Increased competition between air carriers has resulted in cheaper air fares and more choice for consumers.</P>
        <P>A major policy development in the airports sector was the enactment of the State Airports Act 2004 and the appointment of the new board of the Dublin Airport Authority, which has a statutory mandate to do everything necessary to give effect to the restructuring of the State airports. The new Shannon and Cork airport authorities have also been incorporated and all three airport authorities are in the process of preparing comprehensive business plans for their airports for consideration by me and the Minister for Finance. We both must be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork airport authorities before the assets of the airports are vested in these authorities.</P>
        <P>The other main policy issues currently being addressed are the future of Aer Lingus, the second terminal issue at Dublin Airport and the facilitation of greater access for all airlines providing transatlantic air services to and from the <Col N="1424"/>US. I have already addressed the position regarding the future of Aer Lingus and further terminal capacity of Dublin Airport in response to Priority Questions earlier today. With regard to transatlantic air services, I accept that an open skies agreement between the EU and the US is inevitable. Ireland&rsquo;s support will be contingent on an acceptable arrangement on Shannon being agreed between Ireland and the US, and that arrangement being reflected in the EU-US agreement. My officials have been maintaining contact with the US authorities, to explore what adjustments to the current Ireland-US arrangements are possible. While further informal contacts took place on 7 February when some senior US officials were in Dublin for a seminar on aviation regulation organised by the Institute of European Affairs, no conclusions were reached.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.7-?><P>In general, it is Government policy that the three State airports should be in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of users consistent with a commercial mandate. Our six regional airports also provide an additional means of access for business and tourism to the regions, which they serve and my policy is to support the efforts of the regional airports in this regard. This support is manifest through a range of support schemes for regional air access such as the PSO programme, which supports air services to the regions. My Department will also continue to provide support to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the airports and for essential capital works under the NDP. However, the level of support for the regional airports must continue to be considered in the light of wider aviation policy and the availability of Exchequer funds.</P>

	<P>In his recent Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance agreed in principle that an extended ten-year capital envelope was appropriate in the case of investment in transport. This reflects the reality of the long lead-in times required for design and planning, as well as the substantial construction periods required for major capital projects in the transport sector. It also provides clear and concrete evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to provide our First World economy with a first rate transport system.</P>
        <P>The ten-year transport investment framework will identify the investment and outline the measures that I believe are required in order to further develop all elements of national transport <Col N="1425"/>infrastructure, addressing existing bottlenecks and capacity constraints, enhancing quality, optimising the use of the network and making prudent advance provision for future economic growth. It is not possible to outline the specifics of the draft plan pending its consideration by the Cabinet infrastructure committee and by the Cabinet itself.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?><P>The ten-year framework will take account of the substantial changes over the past 15 years or so. We have seen large increases in our population, wealth and employment. Economic growth has led to huge increases in the amount of goods being transported, as well as strong growth in car ownership levels, increased travel demand and increases in the numbers of people and goods passing through our airports and ports.</P>
        <P>The ten-year framework will also take account of the linkages between transport and land use and spatial planning so that we can develop a transport system that contributes to sustainable development in all its dimensions: economic, social and environmental. The plan will be fully informed by and will support the policies set out in the national spatial strategy. It will also take account of the regional planning guidelines adopted during 2004 and will be informed by and support a number of regional land use and transportation strategies for the cities, such as the Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s long-term strategy, A Platform for Change, and the Cork Area Strategic Plan. I am also considering whether the development of this draft framework will fall within the scope of the strategic environmental assessment directive.</P>
        <P>My officials have been engaging with CIE, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office and the expertise and inputs of these agencies have been significant in helping to identify broad lines and priorities for programmes to be undertaken under the auspices of the new framework. The current five-year investment envelope for transport investment is &euro;10.2 billion over the 2005-09 period. The precise financial parameters for the period to 2014 will be subject to final agreement with the Minister for Finance and the Government. Details of the draft plan are being finalised and I will bring it to the Cabinet infrastructure committee early next month.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The statutory basis for the use of cycle tracks is set out in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998. The regulations prohibit parking in a cycle track. The offence of illegal parking in a cycle track comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system and the amount of the on-the-spot fine currently applicable to the offence is &euro;19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences. Where an on-the-spot fine notice is issued, it is open to the person to whom the notice is addressed to pay the relevant amount so as to avoid the matter proceeding to court. Section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which was commenced on 31 October 2002, provides for major increases in certain financial penalties for road traffic offences including an increase in the general penalty that applies to the majority of offences under the Road Traffic Acts, including the offence of illegally parking in a cycle track.</P>
        <P>If the motorist elects to go to court and is convicted of this offence he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;800 for a first offence, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 for a second or subsequent offence and if a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months the person is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both. The determination of the fine to be imposed in each particular case is a matter for the courts. The enforcement of the road traffic parking regulations is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local authority traffic wardens. My Department does not have statistics on the enforcement and prosecution of parking offences.</P>
        <P>The Act also provides for the replacement of the present on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system will bring greater certainty to the application of administrative charges for the traffic and parking offences to which it will apply. It is proposed that the level of fixed charge for motorists who illegally park in a cycle track will be significantly higher than &euro;19. I expect that the roll out of the fixed charge system to a wide range of traffic and parking offences will be completed later this year when the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s new IT fixed charge processing system is in place.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my response to an identical question on 29 September last. The situation since then is unchanged. The location of stations on the rail network is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. The company informs me that it has examined the case for reopening Dunleer station on a number of occasions in the past. A review of the Dublin suburban rail strategy, conducted on behalf of the company, concluded that the station would only have very modest daily boardings given the population of the area. However, I understand that a new development plan has been approved for <Col N="1428"/>Dunleer, which involves significant population growth.</P>
        <P>While I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has still not yet seen the revised development plan, the company has indicated that it is prepared to re-examine its position regarding the reopening of the station if the plan provides for an increase in population in the area and if funding can be provided from developers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004 provide powers to the Minister for Transport to prescribe maximum speed limits for classes of vehicles and to regulate for the driving of such vehicles on the public roads.</P>
        <P>The EU speed limiter directives require that goods vehicles having a design gross weight exceeding 12,000 kg be equipped with speed limitation devices that must be set so that the vehicle speed cannot exceed 90 km/h. From 1 January 2005 that requirement was extended to all new goods vehicles over 3,500 kg. In addition, the mandatory speed limiter requirements for passenger vehicles that accommodate more than eight passengers is that the permissible maximum speed be 100 km/h except for buses with provision for standees, in which case the limiter should be set so that the vehicle cannot exceed 65 km/h.</P>
        <P>The purpose of these EU directives, which have been transposed into Irish law, is to limit to specified values the maximum road speed of certain vehicles. The directives do not constrain member states from setting lower speed limits for the classes of vehicles concerned. The Road Traffic (Ordinary Speed Limits &mdash; Certain Vehicles) Regulations 2005 (SI No. 9 of 2005) made by me on 12 January 2005 prescribe maximum speed limits for certain classes of vehicles from 20 January 2005. The speed limit of 80 km/h has been prescribed for vehicles that have accommodation for more than eight passengers, for goods vehicles having a design gross weight in excess of 3,500 kg and for any vehicle towing a trailer, caravan, horsebox etc. A speed limit of 65 km/h has been prescribed for double deck passenger vehicles.</P>
        <P>In setting the new metric speed limits for these classes of vehicles I made no change to the speed limit policy that had applied since 1992 other than converting the previous maximum limits to the <Col N="1429"/>nearest equivalent metric value. In addition, I also made the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (SI No. 12 of 2005). These amend Article 80 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to provide that, from 20 January 2005, the maximum speed that a bus &mdash; single deck or double deck &mdash; may be driven at when carrying standee passengers is 65 km/h.</P>
        <P>I made further regulations on 12 January, namely, the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2005 (SI No. 11 of 2005). Driving rules for traffic on motorways were introduced in October 1997 under the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 (SI No. 182 of 1997). One of these 1997 regulations prohibited the driving of a vehicle, for which an ordinary speed limit of not more than 50 mph is prescribed, in the traffic lane nearest the right hand edge of a carriageway having more than one traffic lane except where it is necessary to proceed in that lane due to an obstruction or because another lane or lanes are for the time being closed to traffic.</P>
        <P>I made no change in the 2005 regulations to the policy that has applied since 1997 for the relevant classes of vehicles other than converting the previous maximum limit of 50 mph to the nearest equivalent metric value, which is 80 km/h. I made it clear when I announced the vehicle speed limits concerned on 17 January last that I intend to revisit the matter of maximum speed limits for classes of vehicles later in the year. This will be done in consultation with the relevant interest groups including the Coach Tourism and Transport Council.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 328, 331, 342, 348 and 365 together.</P>
        <P>The proposed Shannon rail link was examined in the course of the Strategic Rail Review, which my Department published in 2003. The cost benefit and multi criteria analyses carried out as part of the review showed that the proposal did <Col N="1431"/>not perform very well in terms of net economic benefit and, therefore, it was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy. However, the review was conducted at a strategic level rather than a feasibility study level and many interests in the Shannon region see the proposed rail link as bringing strong economic benefits to the region. As a result of this my predecessor as Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, requested Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to undertake a feasibility study on the viability of this proposal in consultation with various local interests.</P>
        <P>I have brought the matters raised in the letter referred to by Deputy Lowry to the attention of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. However, it is a matter for the company to decide what matters to consider when assessing the feasibility of the proposals. I will, of course, be happy to meet a delegation from Shannon Rail Partnership to discuss the proposal further and following its letter of 2 February, my office has already been in contact with it with regard to a suitable date for a meeting.</P>

        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann considers the development of the infrastructure and the use of particular rolling stock on a route in the light of the demand for services and the likely return on the investment required. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann informs me that it has upgraded all the trackwork on the Rosslare line in the past two years. More modern rolling stock was allocated to the route since last December. The timetable has been altered to provide a better spread of services, including an early morning departure from Dublin. Commuters from Gorey have been facilitated since last year by extending the Arklow commuter train to serve Gorey.</P>
        <P>The company is undertaking a significant network-wide re-signalling project and work on the Rosslare line is due to be completed in 2007. From 2007 onwards it is intended to provide a <Col N="1433"/>two-hourly frequency in both directions on the route with reduced journey times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Last year, my predecessor as Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, appointed a working group to carry out an examination of the proposal to re-open the western rail corridor. The group is under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat McCann, group chief executive, Jurys Doyle Hotel Group. The group comprises county managers, directors of the regional authorities, representatives of city and county development boards, the Western Development Commission, West-on-Track and the intercounty rail committee, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency and my Department. The working group and its sub-groups have been considering the question of the feasibility of the western rail corridor since June last year and I understand that it may now be nearing the end of its deliberations. Accordingly, I expect to receive a report in the coming months. Prior to the receipt of that report it would be premature for me to make any further comment.</P>

	<P>It is not possible to give a breakdown of the level of key rail expenditure in the west and the eastern seaboard region on the county basis specified in the Deputy&rsquo;s question. The provision of public transport, including rail, is by its nature, a trans-regional business. Much of the public transport investment in the five-year period 2000-04 is spread across both the Border, midlands and west BMW, region and the south and east regions.</P>
        <P>The benefits of investment in additional rolling stock, the development and upgrading of trackwork and associated facilities and re-signalling projects across the rail network are felt throughout both regions. These benefits include additional capacity, shorter train journey times and improved quality of service and safety. <Col N="1436"/>Recent examples of this cross-regional investment include the upgrading of facilities at Heuston Station benefiting mainline rail services to the south and west, the acquisition of 80 new diesel railcars, the new diesel rail depot at Drogheda and vast amounts of funding for trackwork and signalling improvements on mainline lines throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Under the national development plan, NDP, and the economic and social infrastructure programme, based on the latest figures available, a total of &euro;210 million was directly spent in public transport projects in the BMW region up to mid-2004. A total of &euro;2.04 billion was invested in the south and east region in the same period. Further substantial expenditure in rail rolling stock and infrastructure improvements was incurred since then in both regions. This will continue to the end of the NDP programme in 2006 and beyond under a multi-annual funding programme for public transport, resulting in continual improvements to rail services.</P>
        <P>The level of capital grant assistance provided to the regional airports in counties Galway and Sligo and Knock in Mayo over the past five years is outlined in the following table:</P><Col N="1435"/>

	<P>As part of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s plans to reshape its loss-making operations, the company has restructured its rail freight operations to refocus on the more profitable elements of rail freight and seek out new business in those areas where the rail mode is best suited to the traffic. I understand from the company that it has had some success in this regard and that its efforts are continuing. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s decision to increase its charges is in line with its plans to return this aspect of its operations to profitability.</P>

	<P>The allocation and deployment of locomotives is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. The company has assured me that it has sufficient numbers of locomotives in its fleet to provide for the demands of the 2005 sugar beet season. I also understand from the company that it operates a pool of locomotives with Northern Ireland Railways which are used from time to time by both companies. These locomotives operate across all Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railway services and are not confined to use in freight movement.</P>

	<P>It is my policy that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann should remain in the rail freight business and I am aware that the company has made great strides in restructuring this element of its operations. As part of an overall plan to address its difficult financial position, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is undertaking a restructuring of <Col N="1439"/>its rail freight business. Its strategy is to develop the profitable traffic it already has, such as bulk freight and trainload traffic, and reshape the loss- making container business.</P>
        <P>I understand the company is in negotiation with prospective customers and continues to examine new sources of business, all of which will serve to reduce the impact of freight on the road network.</P>

        <Quest>, further to Question No. 264 of 28 October 2004, relating to the airport development plan of March 1968 for Dublin Airport inclusive of developmental restrictions associated with both proposed runways and runway extensions, if a similar plan was prepared at or around the same time for Shannon Airport; if such plan outlined appropriate restrictions on runways 06/24, 13/31, 05/23 and 18/36 in addition to catering for extensions to runways 06/24 and 13/31; the details of such extensions; if such plan was conveyed by his Department to Clare County Council; if the council subsequently designated red zones in its county development plan based on the restrictions outlined in the departmental plan.</Quest>

	<P>I understand that in the late 1960s, in the context of drafting a county development plan, a scheme showing restrictions that were considered necessary for the purposes of air safety was forwarded to Clare County Council. I am advised by the Dublin Airport Authority, formerly Aer Rianta, that the scheme took account, <i>inter alia</i>, of possible future extensions of two runways at Shannon Airport, namely 06/24 and 14/32, subsequently redesignated 13/31. The subsequent incorporation of any or all of that information into the county development plan of the time was a matter for Clare County Council.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 and 353 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy seems to be referring to early drafts of ERM&rsquo;s report into public safety zones which were sent to the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by ERM. The draft report on Dublin Airport, dating from 2001, and the draft reports on Cork and Shannon, dating from 2002, were amalgamated by ERM and formed the basis for its draft final report in June 2003 which was published on its website and opened for comments from all interested persons. In addition, ERM held an open day at each of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports at which it presented the results of its work. The report was finalised by ERM in September 2003. Subsequently, the Government, at its meeting on 19 January 2005, approved the drawing up of guidelines by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government based on ERM&rsquo;s report to be issued to local authorities regarding public safety zones at the three State airports.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the issue of guidelines by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will provide a further opportunity for public consultation. Also, when those guidelines are issued to the local authorities concerned, those local authorities will engage in further public consultation regarding any changes they propose to their development plans should they feel that changes may be necessary on foot of the guidelines issued to them. Accordingly, I am satisfied that there has been and will be ample opportunity for the public and any interested parties to give their views on this issue.</P>

	<P>The Dublin Port tunnel, when completed, will have an operational height of 4.65 metres. It is the view of Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority that the Dublin Port tunnel will facilitate almost all of the HGV traffic using Dublin Port. Two vehicle height surveys of HGVs using Dublin Port &mdash; one by the Dublin Port Company and one by the National Institute of Transport and Logistics &mdash; indicate that between 0.6% to 1.7% of HGVs entering and leaving the port exceed 4.65 metres.</P>
        <P>The issue of routing vehicles greater than 4.65 metres through the city will be addressed in the context of the HGV management strategy being prepared by Dublin City Council.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that the Luas system is carrying 300,000 passengers per week. The average Monday to Friday carryings are 50,000 passengers per day. During last December, there were days where passenger numbers exceeded 70,000. Passenger figures on the Luas system are expected to rise during 2005.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the Dublin Transportation Office are carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the effect of Luas on travel patterns. The &ldquo;Before Luas&rdquo; survey was carried out in the spring of 2004 and the &ldquo;After Luas&rdquo; survey will be carried out when time travel patterns have become established after the introduction of the new service.</P>
        <P>The RPA has also carried out less formal research on its customer base and it is clear that a large proportion of Luas users had previously used private vehicles. Apart from car transfers, there also appears to be a significant number of new trips to the city centre for business and-or recreation. This view is shared by city centre businesses which report a substantial increase in business as a result of the Luas, and is reflected in the high levels of Luas usage in the traditional off-peak periods and at weekends.</P>

	<P>The power to determine the locations for the provision of bus stops and termini is vested in the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Under that section, the commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator identifying the specific location of bus stops and termini in respect of any bus route and in that context may determine that certain stops may only be used for passengers boarding or leaving buses. I understand that the Garda engages in a consultation process with the local authority and the bus service provider before issuing a direction under section 85. The provision of bus shelters is a matter for the individual bus operators and the relevant planning authority. I have no function regarding any of these matters.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 359 and 361 together.</P>
        <P>The scheduling and timetabling of trains is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to consider. I understand from the company that some of the 36 new diesel railcars due to come into service at the end of this year will be allocated to the Kildare route to extend all trains to eight-car length. This will improve the capacity on individual trains by up to 20%. This capacity increase comes on top of a capacity increase of almost 160% delivered on that line in the past 18 months.</P>

	<P>The traditionally strong relations between Ireland and Scotland continue to develop in a very positive way, including since devolution. The Irish Consulate General in Edinburgh, which was opened in 1998, is involved in a broad range of activities supporting the development of enhanced bilateral links. These include the promotion of trade, tourism, culture and <Col N="1444"/>investment opportunities in close co-operation with the State agencies and the Scottish Executive.</P>
        <P>In recent years, Irish-Scottish links have also been strengthened by an increasing number of high level visits and exchanges, including visits by the President, Taoiseach and Ministers to Scotland and the attendance by the Ceann Comhairle and Cathaoirleach at the official opening of the new Scottish Parliament in October 2004. We have also welcomed a number of high level Scottish visitors here, including, most recently, First Minister Jack McConnell, MSP, who met the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in Dublin in September 2004. In addition to these ongoing contacts, our participation with Scotland and other members in the British-Irish Council provides a valuable opportunity for practical consultation and co-operation on a wide range of matters of mutual interest.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fully committed to the development and implementation of an all-Ireland animal health and welfare strategy. My ultimate target is a policy that facilitates the free movement of animals on the island, subject to EU rules. I believe that such a policy can generate real, practical benefit for the agriculture sectors North and South and for all whose livelihoods are bound up with agriculture on this island.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that the 2001 outbreak of FMD highlighted the value and necessity of close co-operation and co-ordination between Administrations North and South. The two Administrations worked successfully in a co-ordinated manner at official, ministerial and political level to address the FMD crisis and have since developed co-ordinated contingency arrangements in the event of any future outbreaks of FMD, or indeed other animal diseases. This deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two Administrations will be a linchpin for future implementation of a unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>In the absence of the Assembly in Northern Ireland, the programme of work mandated by the NSMC to agree a common animal health and welfare strategy for the island has been taken forward by a series of working groups at official level. These working groups have met at regular intervals over the past two years. Their work has focused on three main themes: common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island; convergence of internal animal health policies; and development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease.</P>
        <P>The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both Administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE and cross-Border fraud.</P>
        <P>It must also be recognised that the achievement of such an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities. Ultimately, the agreement of the European Union will be required.</P>

        <P>The draft rural development regulation is not just about forestry. It covers a range of rural development measures. Some of the proposals are positive and others, particularly that pertaining to forestry, are not.</P><Col N="1449"/>
        <P>When the proposed new regulation was published by the European Commission last summer, Ireland was one of the first member states to recognise the threat that the draft regulation posed to countries with active afforestation programmes.</P>
        <P>From the outset, the Irish position on the draft regulation in respect of forestry has been clear and unequivocal. We have continually and consistently made known our opposition to the Commission&rsquo;s proposals particularly those proposing to reduce establishment grants, premiums and associated premium payment periods.</P>
        <P>This is the position we have articulated consistently at every level from working group up to the agriculture Council. I expressed my views forcefully on the impact of the proposals for forestry in Ireland at the ministerial agriculture Council meeting in November 2004 and I also restated these concerns directly to Commissioner Fischer Boel.</P>
        <P>Member states are coming to appreciate the full impact of the proposals on forestry and we will continue to work at all levels to achieve the best possible deal for Ireland in the admittedly tough negotiations that lie ahead. To this end, I am heartened by the support we are receiving from all sectors of the industry. Very early on in the process, I established a consultative-liaison group, comprising of representatives of the forestry sector. It meets regularly. Through this group, the sector is consulted and informed of developments and is involved in the development of the Irish position as the negotiations unfold. At this stage, intense negotiations on the regulation are continuing and a final decision is not expected to be taken by the Council of Ministers for several months.</P>

	<P>The person named, having been notified that the circumstances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee.</P>
        <P>Following a full examination of the circumstances outlined in the appeal, the independent single payment appeals committee made a recommendation and a letter issued to the person named on 28 January 2005. The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.</P>
        <P>Both my Department and the independent single payment appeals committee took full cognisance of the medical evidence put forward in this case. However, while accepting the serious nature of the medical difficulties outlined, there is no evidence that production in any of the reference years was affected as a result. Production, both throughout the reference period 2000-02, and during the earlier reference period 1997-99, remained relatively constant.</P>

The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld. However, the Department has now obtained additional information regarding the circumstances of this case and is satisfied that <i>force majeure </i>criteria should be applied. As a result, the year 2000 will be excluded and the single farm payment entitlement will be based on the two-year average of 2001 and 2002 only. An updated statement of provisional entitlements reflecting this position will issue shortly to the person named.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s strategy for developing the potential of small food exporters is implemented by Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility to promote, assist and develop the marketing of Irish food and drink products. Under the national development plan, Bord Bia operates two company grant schemes, namely the market improvement assistance programme and the market participation programme, to enhance the marketing capabilities of micro-sized, small and medium-sized food companies. Funding is provided for trade fair participation, market research and design of packaging and point of sale material. In 2003, grants to the value of &euro;970,000 were awarded to 85 small food businesses.</P>
        <P>Over the past three years small food companies grant-aided by Bord Bia have grown on average by 17% per annum. Strong sales growth has been experienced in Ireland and the United Kingdom, with annual turnover growing to &euro;250 million.</P>
        <P>The Bord Bia small business unit works closely with over 300 small-scale producers to increase trade listings and to improve distribution and marketing capabilities. It provides a range of services including trade and consumer public relations, marketing competency development, buyer relationship management and promotion activities.</P>
        <P>In 2003, Bord Bia facilitated the establishment of the &ldquo;Taste Council&rdquo;, an artisan expert group to encourage the strategic development of the speciality food sector. The council has identified market entry, innovation and distribution as key strategic issues facing small food producers. Bord Bia and the Taste Council have prepared multi-annual strategies to develop the small business and speciality food sector, including development of new routes to market. For example, Bord Bia&rsquo;s Small Business Strategy 2003-2007 focuses on strategic marketing initiatives designed to increase sales in Ireland and Britain.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 and 383 together.</P>
        <P>The value of Irish beef exports to all markets in 2004 was &euro;1.5 billion, representing 25% of total Irish agri-food exports. Of this figure the value placed on live cattle exports is &euro;116 million.</P>
        <P>The EU now comprises 90% of our total beef exports compared with 49% in 2000. The focus of the Irish beef industry is to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced EU marketplace. An increased presence in this high-value market is the key to the success of the beef industry in the long term.</P>
        <P>I am fully committed to ensuring that the option of exporting cattle live to overseas countries is maintained, as it preserves competition in the beef trade. The Department, together with Bord Bia and the Department of Foreign Affairs, will continue to seek to exploit every opportunity to expand the market for the live trade and beef exports.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 387, 396 and 397 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Minch Malt Limited, which is part of the Greencore Malting Group, is to close its malting plant at Banagher, County Offaly, and its two intake points at Tullamore, County Offaly, and Borrisokane, County Tipperary, with effect from September 2005. I am of course concerned <Col N="1454"/>about the closure and the impact it will have on jobs and families in the area. However, the decision to close these facilities was a commercial decision taken by the company itself. The reason given for the closure is increased competition on export markets. Greencore has decided to consolidate its malting operations at its bigger plant in Athy in order to solidify the domestic market. I understand from Greencore that the Banagher, Tullamore and Borrisokane facilities will be offered for sale as going concerns and may be taken over by current players in the trade.</P>
        <P>Farmers who are affected by the closure of Banagher may decide to produce barley for the feed barley market instead. It has been suggested that this will put pressure on grain storage in the midlands area next autumn. Consequently, my Department is currently carrying out an inventory of grain storage capacity in the Offaly-north Tipperary area. In the event that this inventory shows up a problem in storage capacity for the coming harvest, I am willing to examine the possibility of making funds available to deal with the problem.</P>
        <P>The decisions by Greencore to close the malting facilities and the sugar plant at Carlow were discussed in the course of a meeting which I had recently with the company. I have no plans to meet any other company regarding the malting barley industry at the present time.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 388, 389 and 393 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to the proposed new draft rural development regulation for the period 2007 to 2013, first published by the European Commission last summer and which is the subject of intense ongoing negotiations in Brussels. The issues raised by the Deputy relate to proposals for forestry contained in the draft regulation and I emphasise that these are merely proposals at this stage and are a long way from agreement in their present format. The proposals as they stand are unacceptable to Ireland and I have forcefully expressed this view over recent months at every level from working group up to the Agriculture Council. A final outcome on the draft regulation is not expected to be taken by Council for several months.</P>

        <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Galway has not received a higher rate of single payment; if the additional entitlements under the <i>force majeure</i> measure are included in the figure of &euro;3,413.58; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The person named was notified by my Department on 3 November 2004 that her application under the <i>force majeure</i> measure of the single payment scheme was successful resulting in the exclusion of the year 2001 in the calculation of her single payment entitlements. The revised single payment entitlements following the application of the <i>force majeure</i> measure and using the two-year average based on 2000 and 2002 are not included in the figure of &euro;3,413.58. A revised provisional entitlement notification outlining the revised position will issue shortly to the person named.</P>

	<P>My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has set up a technical working group to determine whether earth-lined stores, out-wintering pads and constructed wetlands should have a place in agricultural practice. The working group has taken expert advice from a variety of researchers and other sources and has been preparing detailed specifications and guidance documents for each of these systems. The specifications and guidance documents for the earth-lined stores, together with the group&rsquo;s recommendations, are expected shortly. Similar specifications and documents are being developed for constructed wetlands and a report is due when these have been finalised. A decision cannot be made in relation to out-wintering pads until the results of ongoing research into the environmental implications, operational details and construction requirements associated with the system become available.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 409 and 424 together.</P>
        <P>Section 2 of the Disability Bill defines &ldquo;public body&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill. The definition includes Departments and offices, local authorities and health boards &mdash; paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>g</i>) of the definition.</P>
        <P>The part of the definition which is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions relates to paragraph (<i>h</i>) as follows: </P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>h</i>) a person, body or organisation (other than the Defence Forces) established&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(i) by or under any enactment (other than the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001), or </P>
        <P LI="2">(ii) under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001, in pursuance of powers conferred by or under another enactment, and financed wholly or partly, whether directly or indirectly, by means of moneys provided, or loans made or guaranteed, by a Minister of the Government or shares held by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government; </P>
        <P FLI="0">The broad range of bodies encompassed by paragraph (<i>h</i>)(i) of the definition are all those established by or under enactment, other than the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001. Examples of such bodies are: the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland established under the Radio and Television Act 1988; the Central Statistics Office established under the Statistics Act 1993; the National Disability Authority established under the National Disability Authority Act 1999; the Courts Service established under the Courts <Col N="1461"/>Services Act 1998; and the Legal Aid Board established under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.</P>
        <P>The range of bodies encompassed by paragraph (<i>h</i>)(ii) are those established under the Companies Acts, in pursuance of powers conferred in other enactments, and aided financially by the State.

	<P>Following receipt of a report by a task force on violence against women, which recommended the establishment of a steering committee at national level on the issue of violence against women, the Government established a national steering committee on violence against women in December 1997. The committee comprises representatives from five Departments &mdash; Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; the Health Service Executive, the probation and welfare service, the Garda, the Courts Service, medical and legal professions and the relevant non-governmental agencies working in the area. The national steering committee is chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, and my Department co-ordinates its work.</P>
        <P>In addition to the national steering committee, regional committees on violence against women have also been established in eight Health Service Executive regions throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The remit of the national steering committee is to advise on and co-ordinate a multi-disciplinary and cohesive response to the issue of violence against women. The committee has several objectives which include developing public awareness campaigns, advising on the co-ordination and distribution of resources, including funding for non-governmental agencies, throughout the eight health board regions, advising on the ongoing development of policies including those concerning services and supports and perpetrator-criminal justice intervention issues. The committee has established sub-committees to deal with these issues.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment, the national steering committee has undertaken a number of initiatives, particularly in regard to raising awareness of the issue of violence against women. It has <Col N="1462"/>developed a public awareness campaign on domestic violence which will be conducted from next week as a joint initiative with the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently commissioned the development of a five year strategic plan for the committee. This strategic plan will record the progress that has been made on the recommendations contained in the task force report, take account of developments since the publication of that report and prioritise further progress over the next five years.</P>

	<P>The visa application to which the Deputy refers was refused on 12 January 2005. In assessing any visa application, the visa officer will consider various matters, including whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant would fully honour the conditions of the visa for example, it is unlikely that the applicant would overstay the length of time applied for. The visa officer will also have regard to information provided and to such factors as the applicant&rsquo;s ties and general circumstances in their country of origin.</P>
        <P>The application in question was refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicant would observe the conditions of the visa applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicant had not displayed evidence of an obligation to return home following the proposed visit.</P>
        <P>Sufficient evidence was not submitted to permit the visa officer to establish to an acceptable degree, that a previous relationship history existed between the applicant and their reference <Col N="1463"/>in Ireland. An appeal in respect of the decision to refuse the visa application was subsequently submitted by the applicant. However, based on the level of additional documentation submitted, the appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision to refuse the visa should be overturned. This appeal was therefore refused on the 14 February 2005 and the applicant will be notified of this decision as soon as possible. If the applicant still wishes to travel, a fresh application should be submitted to my Department accompanied by any additional documentation that it is felt will address the reasons for refusal outlined above.</P>

        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which proposes the most fundamental modernisation of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the foundation of the State, <Col N="1464"/>provides that the commissioner will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform.

	<P>The group submitted an application for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06, to my Department some time ago. The programme is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. Following discussions with my colleague the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available over the period 2005-09, in the context of the 2005 budget.</P>
        <P>Of this amount, &euro;50 million is being made available under the present programme and the remaining &euro;40 million will flow under the next phase of the post 2006 programme. This augments the increased EU funding of some &euro;12 million made available last year in recognition of the progress of the programme. This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;499.3 million and now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which &euro;205 million has been set aside. In December 2004, I announced an allocation of almost &euro;35 million in capital funding to community based not-for-profit groups.</P>
        <P>The availability of the additional capital funding will enable me to make further capital grant assistance available over the coming months and years to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money when considered in the context of the current guidelines on building costs. In light of this, the group in question has been advised that whilst its project had not been prioritised for immediate funding in December 2004, it will be reconsidered in the future, and I hope to make further significant capital commitments during 2005 and thereafter.</P>
        <P>The ongoing appraisal of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity. When the appraisal on the project in question is completed, the application will then be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application.</P>

	<P>Heroin seizures for 2002, 2003 and 2004 have remained reasonably static with minor fluctuations in the quantities being seized. The trend for this year to date appears similar to other years with the exception of one seizure of three kilos of heroin at a Dublin address in mid-January.</P>
        <P>While there have been a few heroin seizures at street level to date in 2005, the Garda authorities indicate that there is no evidence to suggest that more heroin is available in the Dublin area.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned arrived in the State on 14 August 2000 and claimed asylum. Their applications were refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and they were notified of this recommendation by letter of 14 November 2001. Their subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and they were notified of this recommendation by letter of 20 August 2002. They were notified of my decision to refuse them refugee status by letter of 26 September 2002 in which they were informed of the three options open to them at that point namely, to leave the State before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made deportation orders in respect of them; to consent to the making of deportation orders in respect of them; or to make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons why they should not be deported that is, why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>The case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), including consideration of all representations received on their behalf. Deportation orders were made in respect of the persons concerned on 9 November 2004. The orders were served by registered post and they presented themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau on Thursday, 10 February 2005. They are due to present themselves again to the bureau on Thursday, 14 April 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including the UN High Commission on Refugees, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. I am satisfied that in this case the requirements of section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement) have been complied with and that no refoulement matters arise. The enforcement of the deportation orders is a matter for the Garda national immigration bureau.</P>

	<P>The visa application in question was to enable the wife of a non-EEA national employed under the work permit scheme to reside with him in the State. A worker employed under the work permit scheme may be joined by his or her spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds. When assessing applications for family reunification, the visa officer considers, among other things, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payments from public funds. As the level of the worker&rsquo;s income in the case in question, as evidenced by his payslips and P60, would qualify for payments from public funds, the application was refused.</P>
        <P>The application was refused because the applicant was not able to support his wife fully. The refusals were appealed but the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude, based on the additional evidence supplied, that the initial decisions should be overturned. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, if the applicant still wishes to travel, she should submit a fresh application to my Department with all required accompanying documentation and the visa section will examine the case anew.</P>

	<P>The Garda domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit was established in 1993 to oversee all cases of domestic violence and sexual assault in the Dublin Metropolitan area. The unit, which was subsequently given a national role in 1997, investigates complex cases of rape and sexual assault and provides assistance to regional and divisional investigation teams with other cases of rape and sexual assault.</P>
        <P>In December 1997, the Government established a national steering committee on violence against women to address the issue of violence against women in Ireland, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault.</P>
        <P>The committee is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, and comprises representatives from five Departments, Health and Children, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the health boards, the probation and welfare service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit, the Courts Service, the medical and legal professions and the relevant non-governmental agencies working in this area, including Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre.</P>
        <P>The remit of the national steering committee is to advise on and co-ordinate a multidisciplinary and cohesive response to the issue of violence against women. The committee has several objectives which include developing public awareness campaigns, advising on the co-ordination and distribution of resources, including funding for non-governmental agencies, throughout the eight health board regions, advising on the ongoing development of policies, including those concerning services and supports and perpetrator-criminal justice intervention issues. The committee has established sub-committees to deal with these issues.</P><Col N="1470"/>
        <P>The national steering committee recently established a working group to consider the treatment services that should be available to victims of sexual violence, including the question of forensic medical examinations. This working group is convened and chaired by an official of the Department of Health and Children which is responsible for the provision of such medical and treatment services. My Department will be represented on the working group.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently commissioned the development of a five-year strategic plan for the committee. This strategic plan will record the progress that has been made on the recommendations contained in the task force report, take account of developments since the publication of that report and prioritise further progress over the next five years.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be interested to know that my Department has provided joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, entitled The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases, is being carried out by the department of law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and Rape Crisis Network Ireland over three years. This research should provide a greater understanding of why some victims choose not to report cases to the Garda, what can be done about under-reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing.</P>

	<P>The Garda authorities responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, inform me that the personnel strength of the Dublin north central division, as at 15 February 2005 was 637 &mdash; all ranks. The personnel strength of the Dublin north central division as at 1 January 1998 was 594 &mdash; all ranks. This represents an increase of 43 or 7.2% in the number of personnel allocated to the division since that date. There have been no recent increases in the number of community garda&iacute; within the Dublin north central division.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. The needs of the north Dublin central division will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a high number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing and will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>The Garda central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to carry out criminal record vetting in respect of prospective full-time employees working primarily in the health care area and in certain designated agencies.</P><Col N="1480"/>
        <P>When the unit became fully operational, it was envisaged that a phased extension of the vetting arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue. The working group submitted its final report in March 2004 and this report has since been published in electronic form on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>On the basis of this report, my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children, announced the provision of additional staff resources for the unit to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to <Col N="1481"/>be extended. The Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement implements one of the key recommendations of the working group. The other practical recommendations are being brought forward by an implementation group chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and comprising representatives of my Department, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, and Finance, the Office of the Attorney General, and Mr Paul Gilligan, chief executive officer of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. The extension of the services of the vetting unit will commence this year as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place, and public announcements will occur in this regard in due course.</P>

	<P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act 1995 and 1997 is the legislative basis for enabling the repatriation of prisoners to Ireland. While the Act was intended, in the main, to allow for the operation of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, it also provides under section 2 of the Act for the repatriation of prisoners from or to a state which is not a party to the convention but with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement for such transfers.</P>
        <P>The United Kingdom adopted the &ldquo;spend and save&rdquo; policy on prisoner repatriation owing to the high numbers of British citizens requiring consular assistance as a result of being imprisoned in foreign countries. The provision of consular services to Irish citizens abroad is a matter solely <Col N="1483"/>for my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I understand, however, that the problem facing the UK authorities does not exist to any great extent in regard to Irish nationals abroad.</P>
        <P>The Council of Europe Convention applies to most countries where Irish nationals have been imprisoned. There are significant costs involved in repatriating prisoners to Ireland to complete their sentences here. A bilateral agreement to allow for the transfer of prisoners to and from another state is put in place primarily for humanitarian and rehabilitative reasons.</P>
        <P>While Ireland has as yet no bilateral agreements in place, several states have expressed an interest in negotiating an agreement. Proposals for the conclusion of a bilateral agreement between Cuba and Ireland are expected to be forwarded to the Cuban authorities soon and that agreement will form the basis for further such agreements between other states which are interested in putting in place such arrangements.</P>

	<P>The group was awarded staffing grant aid of &euro;190,461 over three years in September 2000. In addition, the group was awarded staffing continuation funding totalling &euro;79,375 up to 31 August 2005 under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006. The group submitted an application for capital grant assistance under the programme to my Department some time ago. The programme is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</P>
        <P>The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. Following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of &euro;90 million was made available over the period 2005 to 2009 in the context of the 2005 budget. Of this amount, &euro;50 million is being made available under the present programme and the remaining &euro;40 million will flow under the next phase of the post-2006 programme. This augments the increased EU funding of &euro;12 million made available last year in recognition of the progress of the programme. This brings the total funding available for the programme to &euro;499.3 million and now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which &euro;205 million has been set aside. In December 2004, I announced an allocation of <Col N="1484"/>almost &euro;35 million in capital funding to community-based not-for-profit-groups.</P>
        <P>The availability of the additional capital funding will enable me to make further capital grant assistance available over the coming months and years to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money when considered in the context of the guidelines on building costs. In light of this, the group in question has been advised that while its project had not been prioritised for immediate funding in December 2004, it will be reconsidered in the future and I hope to make further significant capital commitments during 2005 and thereafter.</P>
        <P>The ongoing appraisal of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity. When the appraisal on the project in question is completed, the application will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I note that section 9 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 deals with the making of statements by Ministers in charge of Bills to the effect that such Bills are within the legislative competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
        <P>Perhaps what the Deputy has in mind is section 19 of the UK Human Rights Act 1998. It provides for the making of written statements by Ministers before the Second Reading on the compatibility or otherwise of Bills with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The question of whether a similar procedure should be adopted in our case was fully examined in the context of the preparation of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. I explained the position in this regard during the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government took account of the establishment of the Human Rights Commission in this jurisdiction and its wide role and mandate in relation to the review of proposals for legislation as well as the Attorney General&rsquo;s responsibilities as guardian of the public interest in protecting the Constitution and vindicating constitutional rights. This responsibility co-exists with the functions of legal adviser to the Government, and both areas come into play in the context of the proposals by the Government for draft legislation.</P>
        <P>The two parliamentary systems differ in so far as parliamentary procedures may be established by law in the United Kingdom but in this jurisdiction they are governed by the system of Standing Orders drawn up by each House. Even if legislation provided for such statements, unless adopted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, they would be of no value. It is possible, of course, that the Oireachtas might amend its Rules of Procedure so as to provide for statements indicating the compatibility or otherwise of draft legislation with the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

	<P>The Garda reward fund was set up by the Garda Reward Fund Regulations 1925 in accordance with the provisions of section 18 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 1925. The fund&rsquo;s sources of income are: fines imposed for disciplinary reasons on any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; <Col N="1487"/>fines, penalties or damages granted on foot of summary conviction by the courts to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; fines directed under any Act, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 1925, to be paid to the Garda reward fund.</P>
        <P>Payments from the fund are made by way of awards approved by the Garda Commissioner on foot of recommendations by a Garda reward board. These awards &mdash; Scott Medals &mdash; are made to those garda&iacute; who have shown exceptional zeal, intelligence or ability in the discharge of police duty, or who have performed acts of exceptional bravery. Moneys lodged by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources are also paid to the garda&iacute; involved in the detection of the cases generating the fines.</P>
        <P>The accounts of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reward fund are published annually in the appropriations accounts and are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I have no plans at present to amend or discontinue this scheme.</P>

His subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and he was notified of this recommendation by letter of 12 October 2001. He was notified of my decision to refuse him refugee status by letter of 13 November 2001 in which he was informed of the three options open to him at that point, namely, to leave the State before the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made a deportation order in respect of him, to consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him, or to make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, setting out why he should not be deported that is, why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement) including consideration of all representations received on his behalf. A deportation order was made in respect of him on 19 November 2004. The order was served by registered post and he presented himself to the Garda national immigration bureau on Thursday 20 January 2005. He is due to present himself again to the bureau on Wednesday 23 February, 2005, when it is expected that travel arrangements will have been put in place.

	<P>The pupils to whom the Deputy refers live one mile from the route of service to the post-primary centre in question. My Department is satisfied that they have a level of service within guidelines, and therefore an extension of service is not warranted in this case. As a rule post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than two miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.</P>

        <Quest>if she has received correspondence from the Union of Students in Ireland calling for the suspension of a course (details supplied) in order that a comprehensive debate regarding teacher training, involving student teachers, teachers unions and the general public can take place; and her views on same.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I met the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, shortly after I received the correspondence in question, to discuss, among other things, the matters referred to by the Deputy. Although the matters were fully discussed at our meeting when I made the USI aware of my position, a formal response to the correspondence will issue to the USI shortly. I will arrange to have a copy forwarded to the Deputy in due course.</P>
        <P>The course referred to by the Deputy is a privately-run course provided by a privately owned institution, which is accredited by Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC.</P>
        <P>The graduate diploma in education, which is conferred at the end of this course is recognised by my Department for the purposes of primary teaching. Given the status of this course and the college, it is not within the remit of my Department to suspend the course in question. In order for the course to secure HETAC accreditation, the college in question complied with HETAC&rsquo;s quality assurance and validation requirements. The quality assurance requirements of HETAC, which are published on its website, require, that over time, each provider engages in an institutional self-evaluation process in line with international standards at higher education level, and an external review.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate monitors 10% of the final teaching practice students from the college in question, as is the case for the students of the five colleges of education at undergraduate and post-graduate levels. This process aims to assess the quality of the teaching practice dimension of pre-service education in individual colleges and throughout the system. It also strives to provide information on teaching practice to the Department and the individual colleges.</P>
        <P>In the case of the college, which is the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, this evaluation process <Col N="1496"/>has just been completed by the Inspectorate for the first cohort of the college&rsquo;s students who are due to graduate in June 2005. Analysis and assessment of this work is currently underway and the outcome of this work will be provided to the college covered by the Deputy&rsquo;s question as well as the five colleges of education in a series of meetings with the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate. The provision of feedback to the colleges is a normal practice and it is a valuable means of improving the quality of teaching provided to students.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the monitoring undertaken by my Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate, combined with HETAC&rsquo;s internal review procedures, adequately address any issues raised by the USI in relation to this course. I do not, therefore, consider it either appropriate or relevant to suspend the course in question.</P>

        <P>Planning permission has been obtained and that this project is scheduled to proceed to tender and construction within the next 12 to 15 months.

I intend to put in place a formal legal agreement overning the use of the remaining lands once the school is in place. I recently met with officials of St. Brigid&rsquo;s GAA club and informed them of the up-to-date position concerning the building project.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, my Department has acquired a site for the provision of a new school in Ballytarsna, Cashel, County Tipperary. The building project has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, which were revised following consultation with the education partners, and its progress is being considered in the context of the <Col N="1497"/>school building programme.In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that I recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects country wide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005.</P>
        <P>This announcement is the first in a series of announcements I plan to make in the coming period in relation to the schools building and modernisation programme that will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships; an expansion of the number of schools that will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; details of schools with projects approved under the 2005 summer works scheme; schools whose projects will further progress through the design process and schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning.</P>
        <P>The school in question has also made an application for grant-aid under the temporary accommodation scheme for 2005. Applications under this scheme are currently being assessed in school planning section. Successful applicants will also be announced shortly.</P>

        <Quest>the number of applications received in her Department for resource teaching hours since January 2004; the number of these applications which were accompanied by a psychological evaluation recommending resource teaching hours; the number of these applications subsequently granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and in particular it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching sup<Col N="1498"/>port in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; and deciding on applications for special needs assistant hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>
        <P>For these reasons, the information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. I am however satisfied that the establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services to children with special educational needs and result in a timely response to schools who have made application for SEN supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council&rsquo;s operation through the SENOs will provide a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools and will, I am confident, result in a much improved service for all.</P>

	<P>Following is the information requested by the Deputy in the form of a spreadsheet.</P>
        <P>The schools listed as NEPS schools have NEPS psychologists assigned to them and have access to the full NEPS service. All schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. Details of this have been notified to all schools and appear upon the Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them.</P><Col N="1497"/>

        <Quest>the number of children in each county waiting for an assessment from the national educational psychological service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Provision of individual psychological assessments is part of the work of the educational psychologists in the national educational psychological service. The psychologists do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. School authorities refer children for assessment and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologist&rsquo;s visits. This allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and such children will be seen or referred on in a matter of weeks, if not days.</P>
        <P>An account of waiting lists by county, as requested by the Deputy, is not available. Every effort will be made to ensure that urgent assessment needs will be met before the end of the current school year. To respond to non-urgent needs and to add value to the psychological service, NEPS is pursuing a policy of enhancing the skills of teachers in the areas of group and individual testing, programme development and behavioural management. This means that many children&rsquo;s needs can be speedily met without the necessity for individual psychological assessment, although the psychologists are available as consultants to teachers and parents, thus helping the children in an indirect way. This helps to reduce waiting times for individual assessment.</P>
        <P>NEPS is being developed on a phased basis over a number of years and has not yet reached its full staffing complement. Pending expansion of its service to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners. NEPS has issued details of how to avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments (SCPA) to all schools and these also appear on my Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS is currently conducting a review of the operation of SCPA and is examining ways in which it may be used more flexibly to respond to any unmet needs for assessment.</P>

	<P>As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme for primary school building works a grant of &euro;350,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide additional accommodation. The initiative allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project.</P>
        <P>My Department does not intend increasing the amount of the grant offered to the school. This is because a central tenet of the devolved scheme is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept responsibility for prioritisation, control of costs, and ensuring value for money.</P>
        <P>The allocation of &euro;350,000 was offered to the board of management. It was open to the board of management to accept or reject this offer. Acceptance of the offer to participate in the initiative was also acceptance of the conditions attaching to the initiative. On the other hand, refusal by the board of management of the grant would have placed the project within the relevant section of the 2004 school building programme.</P>

        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the reduction in primary school class sizes in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school, including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2 to one in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44 to one in 2003-04. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break-Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class. In line with the programme for Government commitment, class sizes for the under-nines will continue to be reduced further.</P>

	<P>The national pilot project for teacher induction, which commenced in September 2002, has been developed by my Department in conjunction with the standing committee of teacher unions and university education departments. The general aim of the project is to develop proposals for an effective programme of induction for newly qualified teachers at primary and post-primary levels tailored to their particular professional development needs and sensitive to the strengths, requirements and challenges of the Irish education system. Divided into two components for primary and post-primary levels, the overall project has been managed by a representative steering committee.</P>
        <P>The initial year of the pilot, phase I, comprised an action research phase, during which an in-depth investigation and analysis of the needs of newly qualified teachers was conducted. This work systematically documented the needs of newly qualified teachers, identifying the most <Col N="1506"/>effective means of meeting these needs and making recommendations for a comprehensive policy on induction. The extension of the pilot in the 2003-04 academic year, Phase II of the pilot, facilitated further research into the needs of newly qualified teachers while exploring the effectiveness of a range of induction models in a variety of teaching contexts using newly qualified teachers from St. Patrick&rsquo;s College and University College Dublin. Phase II also allowed for a regional expansion of the project through the Education Centre Network beyond the Dublin region.</P>
        <P>Phases I and II of the project can be regarded as having facilitated the building of capacity within the system in regard to newly qualified teachers. This work has culminated in the recent completion of a report on the progress achieved by the pilot project. This report, which, I understand, is currently at final draft stage, incorporates the findings of the research phase and contains recommendations regarding the development and implementation of a national programme of support for new qualified teachers at primary and post-primary levels. I am informed that the implementation strategy contained in the draft report incorporates the key elements of best practice in induction and mentoring identified in the pilot phases of the pilot project and from studies in international practice and research.</P>
        <P>To maintain the impetus built-up during phases I and II, it was decided to initiate a phase III of the project for the 2004-05 year while the draft report was in progress. This phase consolidates the work undertaken to date and harnesses the experience gained in phases I and II. Additional colleges of education and education centres have become involved in the project which has also been nuanced to cover different types of schools such as small rural primary schools, schools located in disadvantaged areas and schools dealing with issues of special education, social inclusion and other relevant matters from teaching and learning. The development of phase III presents additional opportunities to develop induction and mentoring resource material, assessment and evaluation procedures, develop capacity within the system within the overall context of further investigating the practical implications and resourcing of a national programme.</P>
        <P>I understand that the steering committee of the national pilot project in teacher induction is currently finalising the draft report containing specific and comprehensive recommendations regarding the implementation of a national programme and a timescale for its introduction. Once completed, the report will be presented to me for consideration in the context of the continuum from initial pre-entry education through induction to post- entry continuing professional development over a teacher&rsquo;s career.</P>

	<P>My Department is actively engaged in pursuing the development of a second level programme for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome on Dublin&rsquo;s north side. I have received a letter, dated 8 December 2004, requesting that I meet the parents&rsquo; representative group concerned. Diary commitments to date have not made it possible for me to meet this group. However, my Department is finalising a proposal, regarding the <Col N="1510"/>establishment of a unit for pupils with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, which will issue shortly to a post-primary school on Dublin&rsquo;s north side. As soon as my Department receives a response to this proposal from the school, I will be happy to make arrangements, if so required, for officials within my Department to meet the representative group concerned.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The funding provided by my Department to secondary schools for caretaking services is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants. This provides schools with considerable flexibility in the use of resources as to the manner in which ancillary services, including caretaking, are provided. Caretakers employed by secondary schools are employees of the individual schools and the terms and conditions of employment are a matter for agreement between the employee and the authorities of each school. My Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are employed.</P>
        <P>There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. I was particularly pleased to announce an aggregate increase of &euro;26 per pupil from 1 January 2005 in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant and support services grant for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>For example a secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of &euro;255,761, &euro;275,000 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. While the focus of the support services grants is towards the cost of caretaking and secretarial assistance, schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. These significant increases in the funding of secondary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</P>

	<P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is fully aware of the rapidly developing nature of the Dublin 15 area. Consequently, it regularly meets the local authority to monitor its emerging needs. It has already taken decisive action to tackle the demand for extra pupil places. Specifically, at primary level, my Department recognised the school referred to by the Deputy in September 2004. While this school is operating from another school, officials in the school planning section of my Department are proactively seeking a solution which will provide the school with its own accommodation in the Castaheany-Ongar area from September 2005. This involves the acquisition of a site which is being pursued. It is intended to develop the school to a 24 classroom facility which will provide an extra 700 primary pupil places for the area.</P>
        <P>In addition, a building project is under way at an existing school in Littlepace, Castaheany, which will deliver a 16 classroom permanent school structure. This permanent building, together with a high quality prefabricated structure already in place, will allow the school to operate as a 24 classroom facility catering for 700 pupils.</P>
        <P>Given the level of housing developments and consequent growth in population, my Department recognises the need for a further primary school in the Tyrrelstown area of Dublin 15. In this regard, an application has been received by the new schools advisory committee for the recognition of a new school from September 2005. My officials are working with Fingal County Council to make a suitable site available for the school to coincide with its commencement plans. It is intended that this school will also be a 24 classroom facility.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, it is intended to locate a new school at Phibblestown. Negotiations regarding the acquisition of a site are at an advanced stage. Plans for the delivery of the school building will be made when the site has been acquired.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>if she will consider introducing a system of transfer from primary to post-primary school similar to that now in place in Limerick to ensure that all children secure a place in a post-primary school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The CAO-type application system for post-primary schools in Limerick city is a system which was agreed between the managements of the 15 post-primary schools in the city. It is operated by the Limerick city education centre as a co-ordinated facility for those schools for the forthcoming school year. My Department has no role in the design or operation of the system. The system was put in place to address the difficulties which were experienced last year by some children in the city in accessing places in post-primary schools in the city. I have no plans to introduce a similar system in other locations.</P>
        <P>My Department has a number of support services and programmes in place to ensure that children successfully transfer from primary to post-primary. These include the National Educational Welfare Board, the home-school-community liaison service and the school completion programme. My Department is completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database which will provide accurate and comprehensive data on pupil transfer in the future.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the number of children who did not transfer from primary to post-primary school in 2004; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available at present. The National Economic and Social Forum report of 2002 on early school leaving cited, as a broad esti<Col N="1519"/>mate, that around 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis. There is some doubt attaching to this estimated figure of 1,000 which may be an over-statement of the true position at this stage. My Department is engaged in analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database. This is a significant and complex project which will, in time, facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a number of programmes at both primary and post-primary level to tackle the problem of early school leaving. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</P>
        <P>A key role in this regard is also played by the home-school-community liaison scheme which was extended to each of the 312 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also addresses issues in the community impinging on learning and educational participation. The school completion programme has been implemented to target directly those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects, 300 primary and 112 post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and <Col N="1520"/>outcomes. Both the HSCL scheme and all 82 school completion programme projects operate transfer programmes which are very important in assisting pupils in making the transition from primary to post-primary level.</P>
        <P>The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools. The board has an authorised staffing complement of 94.</P>

	<P>The following schedule sets out information regarding the use of the ministerial air transport service since June 2002. Details regarding the nature of each trip and the persons accompanying the members of Cabinet are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>With regard to the cost of each trip, the total flying cost of the Gulfstream IV is calculated as &euro;5,550 per hour, which includes fuel, handling, maintenance, depreciation and personnel costs. The total flying cost for the Beech Super King Air is calculated as &euro;1,400 per hour. The manufacturer&rsquo;s estimated direct hourly flying cost for the Learjet 45 is approximately &euro;1,000 per hour. A more detailed costing is not yet available for this aircraft, which came into service in January 2004. The total flying cost of the CASA, which has been used infrequently in the past as a back-up to the ministerial air transport service, is calculated as &euro;2,400.</P><Col N="1519"/>

	<P>My Department has been approached by a developer who wishes to access his property through a portion of the RDF property in Thurles, County Tipperary, to facilitate development at the rear. No agreement, however, has been made by my Department to sell any part of this military property nor has any commitment been entered into in relation to the incorporation of any portion thereof into the proposed development. Furthermore, there is no question of relocating the RDF unit elsewhere.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>There are about 6,000 members of the Civil Defence organisation throughout the State at present. Civil Defence celebrated the 50th anniversary of its foundation in 2000 and over that period the primary role of the organisation has changed considerably from that of providing a civil response to potential hazards which might arise in a war situation to one of assisting the primary emergency services and providing community support.</P>
        <P>The Government White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, set out the broad policy framework for the future of Civil Defence as that of continuing to develop its capacity to respond to emergencies as a high quality, second line emergency service in support of the primary services and to facilitate community support activities while preserving the voluntary nature and ethos of the organisation. As part of the implementation of that policy the Civil Defence Act 2002 was enacted and, by means of an order under that Act, the then Minister for Defence established the inaugural Civil Defence Board in 2003. The board is comprised of the main stakeholders in the wider civil protection community and by virtue of the Act has taken over the day-to-day management and development of the Civil Defence organisation at national level from my Department. I expect the board to continue to develop and enhance the role of the Civil Defence organisation in accordance with the broad parameters as set out in the White Paper and with the provisions of the Act and I look for<Col N="1546"/>ward to working with the board in the implementation of its development plans in that regard. As Minister for Defence, I retain overall responsibility for the policy and the funding of Civil Defence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>In July 1996, my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. Their purpose was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system.</P>
        <P>The guidelines advise that &ldquo;in the vicinity of larger towns and city suburbs operators should endeavour to locate in industrial areas or in industrially zoned land&rdquo;. They advise that &ldquo;only as a last resort should free-standing masts be located within or the immediate surrounds of smaller towns or villages&rdquo; and also that &ldquo;only as a last resort should free standing masts be located in a residential area or beside schools&rdquo;. The guidelines are available in the Oireachtas Library. They are also available in electronic format from my Department and will be available on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</P>

	<P>The present position regarding office accommodation for my Department&rsquo;s decentralised office in Kilkenny is that the Office of Public Works is evaluating a number of options in Kilkenny and this process has yet to be finalised. A total of 77 applications had been received at the central applications facility, CAF, priority cut-off date on 7 September 2004 in respect of the 62 posts to be <Col N="1547"/>decentralised. My Department has published on its website, <i>www.enriron.ie,</i> a fact-sheet which includes information on services and facilities available in Kilkenny such as schools, housing and other amenities. In accordance with the recommendations of the decentralisation implementation group, my Department will be setting up small planning groups in conjunction with local interests to help facilitate staff locating to Kilkenny when the timescale for transfer becomes clearer.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 514 and 518 together.</P>
        <P>Local authority mortgages are provided to eligible low income households, who would not otherwise obtain finance. The lending is provided on a self-financing basis.</P>
        <P>The loans the question refers to were issued by local authorities prior to the introduction of variable rates in December 1987, and reflect the long-term costs of the funds prevailing at the time the loans were advanced. Rates were fixed for the life of the loan. The subsequent introduction of variable interest rates for local authority mortgages has provided borrowers with increased flexibility and choice.</P>
        <P>Borrowers with fixed rate local authority repayments are permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and re-finance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession having regard to the redemption penalties of up to six months&rsquo; interest or more applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages. In 2001, the position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to <Col N="1548"/>reduce such interest rates would not be appropriate.</P>

	<P>The Government published the national spatial strategy on 28 November 2002 as a 20-year planning framework designed to enable every part of the country to achieve its potential. The principal aims of the NSS are to achieve more balanced regional development through a better spread of economic activity, employment and population growth, energise the potential of all urban and rural areas with the support of a stronger urban structure, including gateways, hubs and other towns, and set a national context for regional and local planning strategies.</P>
        <P>The strategy aims to build up the strengths of all areas to achieve more balanced regional development and population growth. It recognises that a greater share of economic activity must take place outside the greater Dublin area. To achieve this, the strategy sets out a framework within which gateways, hubs and other urban and rural areas will act together to allow areas to grow.</P>

	<P>Section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act 1997 provides for the approval by the Minister of planning schemes in relation to areas of the docklands. Any development by the authority which is consistent with such a scheme, or any development by a person other than the authority that is certified by the authority to be consistent with such a scheme, is exempted development for the purposes of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
        <P>A certificate granted by the authority under section 25 may contain such conditions in relation to the carrying out of the development concerned as the authority considers appropriate. Where such conditions are not complied with, the relevant development would cease to be exempted development. In that event, the enforcement of planning controls would, in the normal course of events, be a matter for the relevant planning <Col N="1549"/>authority, in this case Dublin City Council, using the mechanisms provided under the 2000 Act. However, under section 160 of that Act, any person, including the authority, is empowered to apply to the Circuit Court or High Court for an injunction in relation to unauthorised development.</P>

	<P>My Department concluded an agreement with the farming pillar under Sustaining Progress in July 2004. This agreement included increased rates of compensation for the cessation of turf cutting in bogs that have been statutorily proposed for designation. The new rates are deemed to reflect the increase in the value of bogs since the original scheme was launched in March 1999.</P>
        <P>The new rates include a scaled incentive payment up to a maximum of &euro;6,000, additional to the rate per acre for purchase of bog or turbary. For people whose bogs were statutorily proposed for designation prior to 1999 and who have already sold to the Department, it was agreed that the new additional scaled incentive payment would be applied retrospectively, with the previous &euro;1,270, £1,000, bonus, where already paid, being deducted.</P>

	<P>There are extensive measures in place under existing electoral law to protect the electoral franchise.</P>
        <P>The returning officer or the presiding officer may of his or her own volition, or if so requested by a personation agent present in the polling station, request any person applying for a ballot paper to produce a specified identification document. If a person fails to produce such a document, or if the returning officer or the presiding officer is not satisfied that the person is the per<Col N="1550"/>son to whom the document relates, they are not permitted to vote. Returning officers or presiding officers may also, or if so requested by a personation agent shall, put certain questions or administer an oath or affirmation to persons applying for a ballot paper.</P>
        <P>Electoral law also sets out a range of offences and penalties in relation to personation, including a new offence provided for under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2004 for the unlawful possession or use of a polling information card. The prevention of personation relies on the deterrent effect of sanctions applicable for committing an electoral offence and on the vigilance of polling staff and personation agents present in the polling station. In this regard, my Department provides on an ongoing basis comprehensive guidance documentation to returning officers and presiding officers which contains detailed advice on countering personation.</P>
        <P>I am concerned to ensure that the legislative and administrative arrangements in place are as flexible as possible while maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process. I will continue to keep current practice, including the scope for further improvements, under review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 525, 526 and 537 to 539, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I recently announced the decision to amend the retail planning guidelines, with effect from 1 February 2005, to provide that the floorspace cap on retail warehouses will no longer apply within the functional areas of the four Dublin local authorities and in the other national spatial strategy gateways. The gateway towns and cities are Athlone with Tullamore and Mullingar, Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Letterkenny, Limerick with Shannon, Sligo and Waterford. This modification to the guidelines will only apply in areas subject to integrated area plans, IAPs, under the Urban Renewal Act 1998.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the retail planning guidelines follows a review of the floorspace cap on retail warehouses, which was set in 2001. These guidelines had prescribed a maximum floor area of 6,000 sq. m. in gross retail floorspace for large-scale single retail warehouse development. This cap has been reviewed, taking account of the need to promote effective competition in this sector of retailing and of ongoing developments in retail formats, while continuing to respect proper planning and sustainable development.</P>
        <P>Following the closing date for the receipt of submissions pertaining to the review, my Department arranged for the preparation of reports summarising the main points raised in the submissions on the review and the analysis of those submissions, with particular reference to the arguments for and against lifting the overall restriction on the size of retail warehouses nationally, as specified in the guidelines, in the context of the issues of traffic impact, the impact on city and town centres and the implications of any change for the national spatial strategy. Two of the reports prepared in this context recommended no change in the existing guidelines.</P>
        <P>In concluding the review of the retail planning guidelines, I considered a number of options. <Col N="1554"/>These included making no change in the existing guidelines, abolishing the overall size cap on retail warehouses nationally, increasing the size cap, making a specific amendment to the guidelines to allow for large-scale unique format stores, and providing for the non-application of the size cap in certain specified areas.</P>
        <P>Taking account of the submissions made during the review and various analyses carried out by my Department I decided, with the approval of the Government, that the revised retail planning guidelines would provide that the existing floor space cap of 6,000 sq. m. gross on a single warehouse development would no longer apply in those areas which are the subject of integrated area plans under the Urban Renewal Act 1998 within the functional areas of the four Dublin local authorities and in the other national spatial strategy gateways. The revised guidelines also specifically provide that to be acceptable from a planning point of view, individual retail warehouses in excess of 6,000 sq. m. must be located close to a road network with sufficient capacity to cater for development of the scale proposed, that any proposal for such a retail warehouse must be accompanied by a traffic impact assessment and that any potential impact on the vitality and viability of town centres will be an important consideration to be taken into account by planning authorities in determining applications for such development. My Department did not commission any specific independent research or studies during the review of the guidelines.</P>
        <P>The National Roads Authority did not make any submission to my Department in relation to the review of the retail warehouse cap. The Dublin Transportation Office made a submission to my Department during the public consultation period, in which it indicated that it did not favour any change to the existing floorspace cap on retail warehouses.</P>
        <P>With regard to suggestions that the company referred to has agreed to operate smaller format stores as a result of the planning regime in the UK, my Department has no specific information in this regard apart from the reports in the media. I am aware, however, that the company has a network of 13 stores in the UK. Eight of these are in excess of 20,000 sq. m. and all of them are in excess of 15,000 sq. m., that is, more than double the size of the floorspace cap which applied to retail warehouses in Ireland.</P>
        <P>To assist in carrying out the review of the floorspace cap, interested parties were invited to make submissions to my Department. Some 71 submissions were received and assessed. Of the 71 submissions received by my Department, 48 submissions were in favour of retaining the existing cap, 19 were in favour of the cap being increased or abolished, and four submissions did not come down on either side. These submissions were fully <Col N="1555"/>taken into account in the finalisation of the review.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 531 and 533 together.</P><Col N="1557"/>
        <P>Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste is based on the principle of producer responsibility, which is intended to require producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end of life. Under the directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005, with a minimum of 25% to be achieved by recycling, including a minimum 15% recycling rate for each type of packaging material. The directive is transposed into national legislation by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997.</P>
        <P>Under the regulations, &ldquo;major producers&rdquo; of packaging waste, that is, manufacturers, importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers, representing all participants in the packaging chain, who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the market each year and who have an annual turnover exceeding &euro;1 million, excluding VAT, are required to take steps individually to recover their packaging waste, that is, self-compliance or, alternatively, to contribute to and participate in compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste. Repak Limited was established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland&rsquo;s packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the directive and is the only such approved compliance scheme in Ireland. Repak membership income is used to subsidise the collection of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors. In the household sector, a subsidy is provided towards the collection of packaging waste from bring banks and civic amenity recycling centres as well as segregated kerbside collection of packaging waste from households. Over 560,000 households or approximately 42% of all households nationally are now served by segregated collection.</P>
        <P>Repak has reported consistent progress since 1997 and in 2001 Ireland met the 25% packaging waste recovery target required by the directive. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has reported in its national waste database interim report for 2003 &mdash; published in December 2004 &mdash; that packaging waste recovery has increased to an estimated 42% in that year, indicating that Ireland is on course to meet the higher recovery and recycling targets for end 2005. While Repak&rsquo;s primary role is to support the recycling of packaging waste rather than packaging minimisation, the fees structure applicable to its members which is related to the type and amount of packaging placed on the market reflects the polluter pays principle and directly incentivises the minimisation and reuse of packaging by producers. As undertaken in An Agreed Programme for <Col N="1558"/>Government and in my Department&rsquo;s 2002 policy document, Delivering Change, a national waste prevention programme was launched last year. The roll-out of this programme, co-ordinated and led by the EPA with funding support from the environment fund, will assist in delivering substantial results on waste prevention and minimisation across all waste streams.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of its approval as an approved compliance scheme under the regulations, Repak is required to submit an annual report on its operations to my Department, including annual financial accounts indicating details of income raised and expenditure incurred. The most recent annual report submitted was in respect of 2003; the 2004 annual report is required to be submitted by the end of May 2005. In the light of the significant increase in packaging waste collected for recycling in recent years which has resulted in increased subsidy payments to waste collectors, Repak has increased its membership fees by an average of 7% in 2004 and an average of 19% in 2005. In the absence of Repak subsidisation of the household segregated collection service, household waste charges would be considerably greater than are being applied by service providers.</P>
        <P>The regulations exempt major producers who are participating in the Repak scheme from having to take back packaging waste from consumers. This exemption is the main incentive to join the collective scheme and thereby contribute to the funding of recycling activities. Removal of the exemption would be likely to undermine the scheme and, given that the existing regulatory arrangements are achieving the desired result in relation to meeting the directive&rsquo;s recovery and recycling targets, such a measure is not under consideration.</P>
        <P>A significant number of retail outlets affiliated to the Repak scheme have voluntarily allowed bring banks to be located in their car parks. In the absence of such good corporate responsibility, the bring bank network would be significantly diminished.</P>

	<P>The revised retail planning guidelines published by my Department on 28 January 2005 have been carefully drafted to ensure that the development of large-scale retail warehouses will contribute in a positive way to urban renewal and the development of the national spatial strategy gateways. Any proposals for retail warehouses in excess of the 6,000 sq. m. cap will have to be situated in an area in respect of which there is an integrated area plan, IAP, made under and in accordance with section 7 of the Urban Renewal Act 1998. In November 1997, detailed guidelines were issued which set out criteria that a local authority shall have regard to in preparing an IAP. Observance of these criteria will ensure that any new large-scale retail development will be consistent with a holistic, well-planned approach to the overall regeneration of the relevant IAP area.</P>
