    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the people of Ireland now understand the true nature of the IRA and what it is about following its statement.</P>
      <P>However, I wish to raise the issue of the Travers report and remind the Taoiseach that I have not yet received a copy and that he has succeeded in his objective of being able to escape from the House for five weeks without having to answer detailed questions about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>For shame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Joint Committee on Health and Children normally meets at 9.30 a.m. but, for reasons best known to the Government, it meets this morning at 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is aware, section 3 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 states clearly that Ministers are responsible for the performance of the functions assigned to their Departments. In the guidelines issued with the approval of the Taoiseach by his Department in 2002, Ministers were reminded of their responsibility for &ldquo;ensuring that the systems are in place and operational to enable the Department to meet its goals and its objectives&rdquo;. This morning we are due to receive a report from Mr. Travers, commissioned by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, into &ldquo;systemic maladministration&rdquo; in that Department. We are informed that a senior civil servant is to be removed from his post.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, as Head of Government, appointed Ministers to various Departments and assigned them political responsibility for those Departments as outlined in his own guidelines approved in December 2002. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, who is not here, has had a chance to read this report. I do not know if he attended yesterday&rsquo;s meeting at which the Government considered the report. Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the Minister has tendered his resignation? If he has not done so, has the Taoiseach called him in or does he intend to call him in to <Col N="574"/>explain the political failures in his performance at the Department of Health and Children? If the Minister has not offered his resignation, does the Taoiseach intend to sack him?</P>
      <P>It is clear the Minister, Deputy Martin, was well aware of the situation, as was the Taoiseach&rsquo;s communications unit, now costing &euro;300,000 per year to tell Ministers what is on the front pages of the newspapers. Will the Taoiseach call in the Minister and exert his authority as Taoiseach with political responsibility by making him answer for his failure of political accountability in running his Department, which will now cost the State &euro;2 billion? At least &euro;500 million of this sum has been accumulated since the Minister became aware of the situation, along with two other Members in the middle Government benches, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, who sat at meetings and, like the three monkeys, saw, heard and did nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Deputies</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I informed the House yesterday, the Government gave initial consideration to the Travers report into the handling of the issue of charges by the Department of Health and Children in regard to patients in long-term care in public residential facilities since 1976, a period of 28 years. On the advice of the Attorney General, the Government decided the method of publication should be through the Oireachtas and that we should move to publish the report without any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The report was supposed to be published at 9.30 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This procedure is being followed for two primary reasons. First, it is in this House that issues relating to accountability and Departments are properly and correctly raised. Second, the House can adopt the report, debate its contents and authorise its public release and thus the report will constitute a publication within the provisions of Article 15.12 of the Constitution. This will ensure full, open and free debate on the important public issues raised by the report without the fear and risk of litigation.</P>
      <P>Obviously, in the case of the publication of any report such as this, it is important that privilege applies to the report and to utterances made in regard to the report. Legal advice has been given on this matter many times and this is the correct procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The same privilege would have applied yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why was the report not published yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a red herring.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="575"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question and he is entitled to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response without interruption. Deputy Rabbitte will have an opportunity to speak shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the legal advice of the Attorney General, used many times in the publication of such reports over the years. As I said yesterday, people should examine the report, copies of which will be given to all Oireachtas Members, and the T&aacute;naiste will meet the Joint Committee on Health and Children to discuss it. It is a lengthy and detailed report deserving of careful consideration. It covers matters that have been ongoing for 28 years, since a circular was prepared in the Department in July 1976. It is not appropriate for me to make further comment at this stage. I and others will have plenty of time and opportunity to comment on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will have no opportunity to do so for five weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the three Ministers involved comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been enough comment, it is time for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s response is absolutely shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a debt of &euro;2 billion to be repaid to those from whom charges were taken illegally over a long number of years. It is well known since 2001, when the Government introduced legislation in this area, that this was the case and the Supreme Court has made that absolutely clear. This amounts to the greatest political handwashing job since Pontius Pilate and it shows quite clearly that the true nature of the Taoiseach and his party is to protect party interests instead of public interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has not answered the question as to whether he called in the Minister, Deputy Martin, or whether the Minister offered his resignation. What the Taoiseach is demonstrating is that he has no political courage. He is afraid to act as Taoiseach in terms of political accountability. The Taoiseach should call the Minister in and dismiss him and his two Ministers of State. This matter was their duty under the management guidelines the Taoiseach introduced in 2002 which state &ldquo;ensuring that appropriate systems are in place and operational to meet the organisation, to meet its goals and objectives&rdquo;. These three Ministers have failed in their duty. We are now going to have a row about whether the Minister, Deputy Martin, was told or was not told about this by the Secretary General, but the fundamental fact is that the Taoiseach bears <Col N="576"/>responsibility for ensuring his Ministers toe the line. In this case three Ministers failed abjectly to live up to their political responsibility and the Taoiseach does not have the courage to dismiss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always unfortunate that Opposition Members make comments on a report before they see or study it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
	<P>And see what culpability the Taoiseach has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Secretary General &mdash; did he see the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On many occasions we are great about talking about justice and it being seen to be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the justice for the taxpayer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and then Members are prepared to say that a report that they have not seen or read&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>We did not get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had a chance of going through the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Call him in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I could be totally political about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the Taoiseach would know nothing about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I could also quote references. A circular went out this morning with an instruction to come in and heckle the Taoiseach, but the public get used to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Roger the Dodger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I could make political points and quote references made by many previous Ministers of Health if I was to be political, but that is not the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>He knew what was in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a report dealing with important issues. We all know the basis of this decision did not have legal status. That is what happened. In 1976 when there was a High Court case we should have provided a legislative base. <Col N="577"/>The then Minister for Health and the then Secretary General of the Department made a decision at that stage and produced circular 7 of 1976 and subsequently down through the years successive Ministers and Secretaries General looked at this issue but moved away from it. That is what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Taoiseach sack the current Secretary General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in making political points about the people in positions in 1976 who have long since left office and everybody else who has been in positions since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only the current Secretary General who is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are trying to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Remember the case of Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue and the fax machine around the matter involving Nora Owen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Members opposite listen? It is a case of the old rant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Taoiseach who is ranting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A few Members who are hardly ever here have been sent in this morning with an instruction to keep interrupting the Taoiseach. People who never read a report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is a slow reader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and who do not care what it is about-&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If they were asked what we are talking about they would not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are publishing the report shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the Taoiseach not publish it yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will deal with the issue. We already dealt with the legislation yesterday. We will have to pay back a considerable amount of money to people because we had not got a legal basis. There are lessons to learn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>And Ministers to save.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will also have to check other regulations and we will do all that. For Members to come in and simply jump up and quibble about things is not necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope when we debate this issue that some of these Members will say something constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach come in here tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is repeating the canard that he needs the privilege of this House to publish the report. He had the privilege of this House yesterday. The report would have the same privilege if the Taoiseach published it yesterday, and he knows that. Now we hear that a civil servant will be removed. In this instance, the taxpayer could be exposed to a bill of up to &euro;2 billion.</P>
      <P>I recall the situation of Mr. Justice Dominic Lynch seeking Government approval to be retired from the Special Criminal Court. When a letter was not issued from the Department all these Front Bench Members danced up and down and I want to tell the House some of what they said. What did Deputy Martin say at that time about a letter not going out compared to the exposure of the taxpayer now to a bill of up to &euro;2 billion in this shambles? He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">From the findings of the Cromien inquiry, it is clear no one is taking responsibility for the sordid nature of this debacle. It seems that civil servants must take the fall for political failure and negligence on the part of the Minister, the Attorney General and others in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the Members opposite remember that? We do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What did the Taoiseach say at that time? He has just condemned people for jumping up and down. The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The inquiry represents an abdication of the Minister&rsquo;s constitutional responsibility for her Department . . .</P>
      <P LI="1" el="0">The identification of serious deficiencies in the Department of Justice does not exonerate the Minister from political accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
      <P LI="1">There is no valid distinction to be drawn between the Minister and the Department. ... The report is particularly critical of management in the Department but that cannot be divorced from the Minister who is appointed for the purpose of managing a Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In a separate volume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The current Taoiseach, when Leader of the Opposition, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">Ministers are entitled to demand the best service the Civil Service can provide but if civil servants fail they should not be scapegoated.</P>
      <P FLI="0">What did the doyenne of probity, the current T&aacute;naiste, say at the time? She said:</P>
      <P LI="1">Accountability means that a Minister must take charge, must exert authority over his or her Department, and must avoid doing certain things because they are wrong but must do other things that are required of them. That is what duty is all about: Ministers must take charge and discharge their duties. A Minister cannot become a prisoner of his or her staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s time is concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>These were the sentiments of Members currently in Government because a letter did not issue on time from the Department of Justice. In this case the taxpayer is liable to a bill of up to &euro;2 billion for this debacle and the Supreme Court said the Minister could not but have known about it. He said it was beyond doubt after 2001. We know that his junior Ministers and himself were minuted at a meeting on 16 December 2003. We know he got the minutes of the MAC meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has gone well over his time. He has had almost double the time allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has contrived to evade his accountability to this House by delaying the publication of the report until after Leaders&rsquo; Questions today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to give way to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>In the case of the terrible tragedy of the tsunami, public interest had abated in it after five weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to obey the provisions of the Standing Order like every other Member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of brief points to be made. I have answered questions on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has answered nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to Deputy Kenny, since the House resumed after the summer recess, he probably raised this matter ten times, and I have answered questions fully on it, although obviously I did not have all the information at that stage and some of the information I had has been proved to be incorrect. I readily acknowledge that. I also answered Leaders&rsquo; Questions on this matter yesterday from the two main Opposition parties and I have answered them today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has answered nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure I will answer them again. I will make myself available on a daily basis inside and outside the House to talk to the media on any issues of the day, and I will make that a practice. What has been said in that regard is hollow political criticism.</P>
      <P>In whatever debate we will have on this matter, I have no doubt the Minister, Deputy Martin, and others will have the opportunity, which I am sure they will welcome, to say their part and therefore I do not have to say it for them. They will give their account of issues.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is right in that this was known about dating back over a long period. From reading the report I think it was known about in the summer of 1976.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>When Fine Gael and Labour were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also think it was known in the summer of 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>And 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think it was also known in the summer of 1994 and in other times when colleagues of mine were in power. Action was not taken and the process did not provide the legislative base required. That is what happened. We can jump up and down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Was it known in 2003, when the Minister, Deputy Martin, was late for a meeting of the management advisory committee? One sometimes gets the impression that the Department of Health and Children was on autopilot at that time. That Ministers were late for important meetings seems to bear that out.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;especially children with autism, are deeply disturbed and distressed by the plight of a family, which has made national headlines recently? It seems that last weekend the Health Service Executive took the children from the family in question because the family had clearly indicated to the media that it was finding it difficult to cope in the absence of State support and resourcing. Does the Taoiseach realise that many thousands of families throughout the State are afraid to highlight openly the difficulties they are wrestling with? I am sure they have contacted Deputies from all sides of the House to express their fears. The Taoiseach should not doubt that this is a serious matter. The parents of children with special needs are struggling to cope because they are facing the difficulties and challenges encountered by the family I mentioned, which is now facing a terrible vista.</P><Col N="587"/>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that there has not been any substantial change since the publication in October 2001 of the report of the task force on autism? The report claimed that the State &ldquo;is critically unable to meet the needs of children with autistic spectrum disorders in Ireland&rdquo;. Does the Taoiseach agree that the Government is duty bound to rectify the disgraceful neglect of decades and to provide these children and their families with all the resources they need? The State&rsquo;s response, by way of the provision of resources, must be in the critical service areas of education, therapeutic support and respite. It must also provide all the other supports that are needed. Instead of heaping blame on families for spelling out the reality and truth of their circumstances, will the Government and State not take their responsibility seriously? What guarantees will the Taoiseach give the family in question and all families in this dreadful situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the difficulties faced by the family. I know it has an extraordinarily complex family situation with which to deal. I am aware of the case. It was discussed by my colleagues yesterday at the Cabinet meeting and I have been briefed on the issues. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, has been fully aware of and involved in the case in recent days. She has personally spent a large part of the weekend dealing with the relevant issues. My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been dealing with the family since it came to Ireland, at least for 15 months. I have been talking to him at some length about the case.</P>
      <P>Any case involving children is distressing to everybody involved. For legal reasons, I cannot go into the details of the case in question. The Deputy has not asked me to do so. The Child Care Act prohibits the identification of children who are the subject of care proceedings. I agree with this because children are the most vulnerable people in our society.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked me about the various facilities that are available. As I understand it, this has been discussed and there has been an effort to try to reach agreement on both the education and health issues in respect of the case in question. There has been an enormous effort made to try to reach agreement and I hope those involved will achieve this. A number of people are working in this regard.</P>
      <P>Let me consider the funding for this sector generally rather than in respect of the case in question, given that the Deputy raised the matter. Additional revenue and capital amounting to &euro;400 million has been invested in support services for those with intellectual disabilities, particularly those with autism. The Department of Education and Science is developing the network for special educational provision for children with autism. <Col N="588"/>The extent of progress in this area can be measured from the fact that, over the past few years, when autism was recognised as representing a distinct special educational need, a number of special dedicated facilities have been developed. Pre-school classes for children with autism have been established, as have special classes for children with autism, attached to the special schools and mainstream schools. Special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome have also been established. Facilities have been developed and sanctioned on a pilot basis which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model, ABA, in response to the needs of children with autism. Another major landmark in the development of autism-specific services was the launch last autumn of the Middletown Centre for Autism by the Minister for Education and Science and the relevant Minister in Northern Ireland. An enormous amount of work has been done.</P>
      <P>I hope the plan to deal with the particular needs of the family in the sensitive case in question will, if it is not already worked out, be worked out in the next few days. We are all concerned to see the case dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reference to the Middletown Centre for Autism on the Armagh-Monaghan border. Nothing better underlines the absence of priority and commitment on the part of this Government in respect of autism than the reality that, even now, despite the fact the British and Irish Governments have acquired the property at Middletown from the St. Louis order, the centre is not expected to be resourced and up and running until autumn 2006. If there was a real sense of urgency in this area, the project would be fast-tracked and the centre would be up and running in 2005. It should have been up and running a long time ago.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate by way of response to the families who are crying out for further redress of autism, and in light of all that is now taking place in this area, whether he will fast-track the Middletown autism centre so it will be completed in 2005?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in the exact date of completion. The original date was to be in the autumn of 2006 and those concerned are working towards that.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is obviously familiar with the Middletown Centre for Autism. There are a number of key facilities to be provided in the centre. There is to be a residential learning support service, which means the whole issue must be dealt with and the centre must be capable of taking people on a residential basis. There will be an educational assessment service, a training and advisory service, which is enormously important, and an autism research and information service.</P>
      <P>The centre must be physically constructed and prepared. Most important, the expert staff in this area must be recruited. It is estimated that the project will be completed in 18 months but I hope it will be sooner. The plan has already been approved. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, is enormously supportive of it and has been driving it forward. It will be up and running next year. Obviously, all the other areas that I mentioned are already ongoing.</P>
      <P>This is an area in respect of which the budget has increased, in a small number of years, from zero euro to over &euro;400 million. There was no funding initially because the area had not been identified as a special area. This funding is mainly expended on professional staff who are dedicated to trying to assist families, such as the one to which the Deputy referred, in dealing with the educational and health issues associated with autism. They are trying to deal with the considerable difficulties faced by these families.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The total expenditure of my Department in 2004 was &euro;29,172,288, compared with a total Estimate provision of &euro;37.5 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach informed the House recently that the cost to his Department of the Moriarty tribunal in 2004 was &euro;3.607 million. The tribunal was established in 1997 and, although it is now in its eighth year, there has not yet been an interim report. The Mahon tribunal, formerly known as the Flood tribunal, has produced four interim reports, thus keeping the public and the Administration up to date. However, we do not know the timescale for the Moriarty tribunal. Is the Taoiseach concerned about this? Has he determined when the tribunal will end? Are we to have a report indicating the progress that has been made? Given that the tribunal sits very infrequently, when does the Taoiseach believe Mr. Justice Moriarty will be able to bring his deliberations to a conclusion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered questions on this matter last week. First, on the financial issue, expenditure of the tribunal in 2004 amounted to &euro;3.6 million. I gave the full figures last week. In 2004 this subhead included a provision to meet the payment of legal costs arising from the award of costs to parties appearing before the tribunal, should its work be completed during the year. As the tribunal was still sitting at the end of the year these costs did not arise.</P>
        <P>Before the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, left office, he spent a number of months working with the Attorney General to try to arrive at a final date for all the tribunals, particularly the Moriarty tribunal, so he could give additional resources while keeping the fees at a certain level. I am not sure if the Moriarty <Col N="591"/>tribunal needed resources but some tribunals did to bring them to final dates. Those dates were agreed. If I recall correctly what I said last week, the Moriarty tribunal is due to finish in early 2006.</P>
        <P>I have given dates on all the tribunals over the years and have been out by many years so I do not know when they will conclude. I am sure the new fee arrangement will come into effect if the tribunal is not finished by that date. That arrangement has been nailed down.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s comment on interim and final reports is factual but I have no control over that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The expenditure for the Department of the Taoiseach for this year includes an estimate of &euro;200,000 for the task force on citizenship. Will the Taoiseach expand on that and advise us exactly how those moneys will be spent? I note also &euro;311,000 was spent on the Newfoundland-Labrador business partnerships in 2004 and the estimate for this year is &euro;321,000. Will the Taoiseach explain the purpose of that expenditure and what return we receive for that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The task force on citizenship was one of the issues with which my Department dealt by co-ordinating the activity of various groups on the issues of citizenship. This fed into the social partnership model and into a wider model where detailed work was undertaken. I do not have a detailed briefing note on this but work has been ongoing in the Department with a broad spectrum of bodies and groups.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago the then Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, established joint agreements with Newfoundland-Labrador in a number of areas. This was successful and was the one project which John Bruton asked me to follow up because he had put much personal work into it. Ireland has a long historic relationship with Newfoundland-Labrador but the relationship had not been developed. Mr. John Bruton formally set up this memorandum of understanding which has been updated twice since then.</P>
        <P>It covers education, cultural issues, genealogy and family histories and several other streams as well as business. The latest event under the memorandum was a visit here late last year by the Prime Minister with a large trade delegation. Several of our Ministers have visited there in recent years. We have built co-operation on a historic base and it has been an excellent project.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach please furnish a response on the task force given that he does not have the detail today?</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will get that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the &euro;29 million spent by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department include expenditure on the lawyers in the Moriarty tribunal? If top <Col N="592"/>barristers were paid the same rate as labourers on Gama&rsquo;s construction site what would the saving be to his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That question does not arise out of these four questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer would be interesting all the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It would take me a while to do the mathematics.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Under headings A5, A6 and A7 in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s accounts there seems to be an explosion of spending on office premises, which has increased by 119%, while spending on machinery and other office equipment is up<?oasys _jy?>55%. Can the Taoiseach recall what consultancy services caused an increase of 77%? Did Mr. Phil Flynn do any consultancy work for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered a written question on that recently. I do not think Mr. Flynn received any remuneration from my Department. He was chairman of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation committee but that is not considered as consultancy work.</P>
        <P>The expenditure on consultancy was &euro;153,122 which was mainly on the employee opinion survey and professional services for a report on comparative international approaches to redress for customers of the Civil Service. Of that, &euro;13,198 was spent on public relations.</P>
        <P>Expenditure under A9, the EU Presidency, includes &euro;158,280 on consultancy services. I do not have a breakdown of the figures for those contracts. The Presidency is one and the other is the employee opinion survey for the Civil Service redress system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach comment on current and future spending levels for the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum? There has been criticism recently that this is increasing but there is merit in increasing this funding, as both organisations do valuable work in assessing future trends and the direction of policy for the Government and those who aspire to be in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A total of &euro;1.032 million was provided for the National Economic and Social Development Office under subhead M of the Department&rsquo;s Vote. This office comprises the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum to which the Deputy has referred. The primary role of these bodies is to facilitate and promote complementary programmes of research, analysis and discussion. They have a shared administration and submit reports to Government.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council provides strategic economic reports looking forward in various areas of the agreed programme <Col N="593"/>for Government. The National Social and Economic Forum looks at the social programme. Both bodies are representative of the social partners and of a broad spectrum of opinion, including independent and other members. From the point of the view of the State and value for money, having them together and with joint administration is practical. They do not take their direction from the Government but have a high level of independence in their analysis. The only report the Government requests is the analysis for each round of pay and economic agreements. Most of their other studies are based on the range of issues raised by their own members.</P>

        <Quest>the progress made within his Department in the implementation of the strategic management initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[6084/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
        <P>The strategic management initiative was launched more than ten years ago with the objective of improving the quality and efficiency of service to the Government and the public. While it has evolved over time, the main focus has been on the areas of strategic management, customer service, financial management, human resource management, regulatory reform and information systems management. In the case of the Civil Service, a detailed modernisation programme has been pursued under each of these headings, while broadly similar reforms have been applied across the wider public service. Implementation has been supported by specific commitments and verification processes in national pay agreements. The implementation group of secretaries general, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, oversees the modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>In 2002, an independent evaluation of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service by PA Consulting concluded that the Civil Service is a more effective organisation than it was a decade ago and that much of this change can be attributed to the strategic management initiative. However, it also concluded that implementation of the modernisation programme was not complete, particularly in the areas of human resource and financial management. Since this evaluation, significant further progress has been achieved. It is not possible to cover all aspects in this reply, but I would like to mention in particular progress with new legislation for recruitment and discipline of civil servants, new recruitment and promotion arrangements under Sustaining Progress, roll-out of the management information framework, introduction of multi-annual capital budgets, publication of customer <Col N="594"/>charters, increasing provision of public services over the Internet and publication of the White Paper on Better Regulation.</P>
        <P>Under Sustaining Progress, performance verification groups have been established for the main areas of the public service. These have independent chairs and include customer and business representatives. They are required to satisfy themselves on progress in regard to modernisation and change prior to approving payments under the agreement, which include 75% of the benchmarking awards. The progress reports submitted to these groups are publicly available and demonstrate considerable achievements right across the public service.</P>
        <P>The reports submitted to the performance verification group in respect of my Department demonstrate significant progress in a range of areas, including internal audit and expenditure reviews, development of the e-Cabinet system, publication of the customer charter and implementation of the management information framework and human resource management system. These are just a few examples of greater flexibility, productivity and customer focus within the Department which helped to ensure that the PVG approved the payment of increases due under Sustaining Progress on each occasion.</P>
        <P>A considerable amount has been achieved in modernising the way the civil and public service operates. Equally, it is clear that there is scope for further improvement and the Government will continue to press ahead with reform programmes in the public service and other sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a long and confusing answer. One of the outcomes of the strategic management initiative of which the Taoiseach will be aware is the enactment of the Public Service Management Act 1997. I do not wish to reopen the debate we had this morning, but does the Taoiseach agree that, under that element of the strategic management initiative, it is the responsibility of Ministers to ask questions where they consider public servants have not briefed them properly on a particular issue? When writing in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 7 January 2001, Mr. Fergal Bowers said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate to quote during Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not quote from the article, I have memorised it. Mr. Bowers said that thousands of medical card holders in public beds were charged&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That issue does not arise on these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not yet get to the question. The Taoiseach said that his Department has become more productive and more customer focused. We are, for instance, paying &euro;300,000 for the communications unit within his Department. <Col N="595"/>Does the Taoiseach think that people would have seen that article on the front page of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7 January 2001, that they would have brought it to the notice of the Minister and, under the SMI, questions would have been appropriate?</P>
        <P>In light of the analysis by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department that the Civil Service is now better than it was, will he give us two or three examples of where there is a significant improvement in customer focus or public benefit from his Department under the strategic management initiative so that people on the street can say the Department of the Taoiseach has improved in these areas and there is a better service for Mr. Citizen?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first issue, the Public Service Management Act is in place. Obviously it is up to Minister&rsquo;s direct staff and wider staff to keep abreast of issues that are discussed, and normally that happens in an effective manner.</P>
        <P>On the improvements that have taken place in the Department since the introduction of the modernisation programme, I have answered this question on a number of occasions. In general, over the past decade since the SMI was introduced, there has been staff flexibility and improved capacity to respond to changed circumstances and external pressures right across the Civil Service. Staffing numbers in my Department have been reduced over the past three years, but still &mdash; during the EU Presidency when we had to take on additional staff &mdash; by and large, they were able to deal with the increased workload. Certainly there is more productivity and accountability given the introduction of expenditure and business plan reviews. The new financial management computer system which has been introduced in my Department and other Departments is very good. It itemises and identifies certain aspects and makes people responsible for budgets right down to a micro level, which was not the case up to now. It is a good cost base within Departments.</P>
        <P>There is a more focused response to customer needs, with specific targets outlined in the Department&rsquo;s customer charter, and regular evaluation of progress. My Department published a customer charter, which sets out a range of commitments across all aspects of the service provided by the Department. Intensive consultation took place with external customers. It has not just been a case of the Department saying it is doing a great job. People who deal with the Department have been asked in detailed questionnaires for their views, what can be improved and what can be dealt with more speedily. More than 400 external customers were surveyed as part of this process. The Department was considered by customers to be a high performer both in the public and the private sector. Performance in regard to the commitments in the customer charter will be reported in the annual report. It is not <Col N="596"/>just an aspect which is mentioned but not followed through.</P>
        <P>My Department also established a performance indicators group. It runs pilot schemes across divisions in the Department and prepares a report for the management advisory committee on issues that arise in the various sections. Performance indicators for each division will be outlined in the strategy statement this year and for the period up to the end of 2007. This does not refer to all the issues relating to technology. There is much greater mobility of people within sections. This takes place on a regular basis so that people can gain broad experience.</P>
        <P>The one negative aspect that still exists is that there is not enough mobility between Departments, particularly in terms of my Department. If one spends all one&rsquo;s life in my Department or the Department of Finance, one will have a particular point of view. It would be better for the people involved and for everyone else if there was greater inter-change between Departments. However, this will not be easy to achieve.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach does not intend spending all his life in his Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In terms of the success of the strategic management initiative, when the Taoiseach says that Departments are preforming better now than they were 20 years ago, is it not difficult to take that statement at face value on the day when the Committee of Public Accounts will publish a report showing that the Department of Education and Science concluded a deal with the religious orders that exposes the taxpayer to a bill of &euro;850 million, with only &euro;128 million being recouped from the religious? That may have been a political decision but after last week&rsquo;s High Court case, it looks like the Comptroller and Auditor General was uncannily accurate when he said it would cost &euro;1 billion and the Department did not update its assessment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Again that is a question for the line Department. The general question is for the Taoiseach but a detailed question should go to the line Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The question reads &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach if he has satisfied himself that the strategic management initiative is achieving its objectives&rdquo;. I am instancing a case where it is manifest that it is not doing that and I submit that the question is perfectly in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should just ask the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>In the Department of Health and Children on the same day, the Travers report has revealed, if we are to believe what the Taoiseach&rsquo;s spin doctors are saying to journalists, the taxpayer has been exposed to the tune of <Col N="597"/>between &euro;500 million and &euro;2 billion for a shambles that, according to the Taoiseach, has gone on since 1976. How did the strategic management initiative focus on better performance in the Department of Health and Children? That information was elicited in this House by an Opposition Deputy. Is it not the case that the present Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was sent off to investigate this issue as a result of questions from Deputies Perry and Kenny on this side of the House? Where was the strategic management initiative in Hawkins House when all that was happening? It beggars belief that the taxpayer is stuck with these bills and that the Taoiseach says the strategic management initiative is working.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was answering a question asking if the initiative has made major improvements in the modernisation of the public service, staff flexibility and output of Departments. That is not to take away from the fact that some Departments work under enormous pressures on day-to-day issues. In fairness, one of the issues Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, the Travers report, which I read in detail last night, shows the pressures under which senior members work on day-to-day issues. It shows in one way that many of the surveys and reports carried out on the health reform package of recent years are correct that it is not best practice for the Department to deal with the day-to-day issues as well as the policy issues. It is a good advertisement for the Health Service Executive where one group deals with policy issues and not day-to-day crises because otherwise people focus on one thing they should do and they go off and actions are not followed up. It is a human issue.</P>
        <P>It is fair enough for the Deputy to say these things should not happen. Someone can look at the issues, as we see in the Travers report, and identify the procedures that should be followed. If it were all done perfectly, that would happen but it is not so exact that everything is written down and followed. The Deputy is right; it is costly in these issues.</P>
        <P>The indemnity scheme is a different issue. Deputy Rabbitte has answered the question himself. The Government decided that a redress scheme would be established following the apology I gave on behalf of the Government six years ago. The view was that it was preferable for congregations to make a meaningful contribution instead of no contribution and instead of the State being required to sue the congregations later. If all the 5,000 cases had gone to court, the legal fees would have been enormous and it would have been traumatic for the victims. Many of the congregations had their properties tied up in trusts and it would not have been possible to receive the money. Congregations are not like companies, as we found in those discussions, and the questions of illegal acts by members had been fully tested. It was not a simple question of being able to take their assets from them. The Govern<Col N="598"/>ment had decided to establish a redress scheme on way or another. I have not seen the report yet but I will look at it when it is issued.</P>
        <P>The strategic management initiative is giving taxpayers better value for money and facilities in public services. The PA report stated that the modernisation programme should deliver better services for the resources provided. Now staff are more flexible and there are longer opening hours in Departments. There is new technology that allows people to use the Internet for tax returns. Resources are better targeted, the expenditure review initiative is in place, management performance is monitored, staff are recruited and managed more effectively and there is greater use of competitive promotion. Organisations are structured more effectively, with separate agencies such as the Courts Service being established. All this has taken place under SMI, not to speak of customer reports, strategy statements and annual reports of scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General. They have substantially improved the public service in spite of the pressures on some Departments. There are issues surrounding that and issues in the report today of which account will have to be taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We all make mistakes but democratic accountability in this House corrected the mistake in respect of charges being illegally levied on older people in nursing homes and other State institutions.</P>
        <P>Is it not the case that whatever about the success of the strategic management initiative, enormous cost overruns are being identified throughout the entire Civil Service every year by the Comptroller and Auditor General? The over-70s medical card is a good example where the Department underestimated by 66% the cost of the scheme. The Secretary General of the Department may well say that he did not get any political notice of the decision to introduce that card. When the Taoiseach says that the Departments work under great day-to-day pressure, I am sure that is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a question. Again I point out that supplementary questions should relate to the strategic management initiative either in general terms or in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own Department. Questions concerning matters relating to other Departments should be addressed to the Minister concerned. That is a ruling of the Chair in accordance with the predecessors who have always ruled in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the efficacy of the strategic management initiative and I am showing the loopholes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to individual Departments, detailed questions should be addressed to the line Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have said before, if the Ceann Comhairle had his way, he would not permit us to ask the Taoiseach anything, whether he went for a jog this morning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or what he had for breakfast, if he opened any pubs recently or if he went to Croke Park or Tolka Park. This is the acid test of the strategic management initiative and I am asking the Taoiseach if it is not difficult to reconcile his praise for the performance of the initiative with the lapses that still occur in various Departments. I have instanced the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. Is it the case in the Department of Health and Children that it is not the acute day to day pressure it is under &mdash; as I am sure it is &mdash; but this has been known to the Department since 2001 at a minimum? The Travers report for all I know, I have not read it, will show that it was known to the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. He should ask a question rather than make a statement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not difficult to reconcile what the Taoiseach has said about the efficacy of the strategic management initiative and the actual experience before our eyes from a number of Departments, including the Department of Health and Children in the debacle which is going to cost the taxpayer up to &euro;2 billion?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask a question on the same point? I referred to the guidelines for Ministers and implementation of the Public Service Management Act 1997 which was part of the strategic management initiative. I have just seen the report we have awaited. Central to that report is a letter on page 157 from the soon to be former Secretary General who said he briefed the Minister for Health and Children at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, that does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does and I will tell you why.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should ask a general question on the strategic management initiative. A detailed question should be addressed to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If you let me finish I will tell you why it arises, Sir. One of the outcomes of the strategic management initiative was the Public Service Management Act 1997. One of the central elements of that Act was that Ministers are responsible for appropriate strategies and systems to ensure the organisation is in the place.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, under the strategic management initiative, brief the Taoiseach, as referred to on page 158 of the Travers report, on the fact that the knowledge that these charges on public service beds was illegal at that meeting?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise out of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on the matter. It does not arise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It does. It arises from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s own guidelines in 2002 on ministerial responsibility. They are the guidelines issued by the Taoiseach in respect of the strategic management initiative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps I can make a brief reply on the specific question and then I shall answer the more general question. I had no discussion with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley. However, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, said in the correspondence on that occasion that two issues arose, one being the distinction between eligibility and entitlement for the over 70s. He said he mentioned that to me on the margins of a vote. The other issue he mentioned was that his Department was seeking to get definitive legal opinion on the proper definitions of what was going to happen. That is what he said he told me. We did not have any discussions about the broad substance of the issues. <Col N="601"/>That is the question on which the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, was interviewed and gave that evidence, which is on page 157 or 158 of the report. That is the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the bottom of page 157 and the top of page 158.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is Michael Kelly&rsquo;s statement, not Deputy Callely&rsquo;s.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, was asked if he followed-on and if he raised it with the Minister. I will let the Minister answer that. In relation to me, he said that there was a major issue related to the distinction between eligibility and entitlement and that his Department was going to seek definitive legal advice. As the Deputy is aware having raised the issue, the Department did not seek definitive legal advice until the Deputy raised it here in October. That is the answer to that question.</P>
        <P>On the broader issue of the Public Service Management Act 1997, which was one of the first I introduced in September 1997, it governs who is responsible and sets out the arrangements. Section 4 of that Act determines how issues are designated and dealt with and how various functions are delegated. That Act works and is followed very clearly in my Department and I am sure that is also the position in other Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We have all been busy reading the Travers report but would the Taoiseach agree it has significant implications for the strategic management initiative in the way Ministers interact with senior civil servants? In this instance, it seems that senior civil servants are taking the rap and that the politicians are equally culpable, if one reads the Travers report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As people will see when they read the report, from 1976 to the time Deputy Kenny raised this issue &mdash; I acknowledge this because I was involved in the discussions in the autumn &mdash; even though this matter was raised on so many occasions over 28 years, there was never a memorandum on the issues. This is extraordinary but it is a fact, and I am not blaming or dumping on anyone. I think the reason for it, and this is my honest opinion, is that they believed that the principle of people paying was fair and right. I think we all agree with that. The problem is that each time it went back they came to a conclusion that it did not require legislation and even when there was legal advice from some of the health boards they stuck to that position. Even at a later period and at the meeting to which Deputy Kenny has referred they said they would get legal advice. That was in December and still that had not happened in October. That is the dilemma. I do not know why it did not come forward as a <Col N="602"/>full memorandum, which as Mr. Travers said, is the issue. People will have to study the report.</P>
        <P>There are some issues on staffing that have to be dealt with. I am not into blaming all public servants over a 28 year period. They came to a decision, based on what they thought was an interpretation that was formed in 1976, and they believed they were right in that all the way through that period.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

	<P>I object to the proposal for No. <i>a</i>9. It is quite clear that this matter ought not be taken without debate.

	<P>I am entitled to my view that the Taoiseach and his Government are making a mockery of this place to have statements without questions. I am entitled to my view, I have been elected by people. You will not suppress my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Deputy was reflecting on the Chair. I will hear the Taoiseach and put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked two questions. No. <i>a</i>9 is a motion to ensure that the report is properly presented to the Members and to the committee. I understand there will be a later meeting of the committee with the T&aacute;naiste today. There will be a debate tomorrow which can either start tomorrow and continue later or else there will be <Col N="607"/>statements and the House can return to the matter when Members have studied the report. There should be a debate in the House tomorrow. I confirm that the T&aacute;naiste will open the debate and the Minister, Deputy Martin, will speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The report has been published. Does it have the privilege of the D&aacute;il given that it has not formally gone before the committee by way of motion? In other words, does the published report have the status of a privileged document?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Ceann Comhairle carry out an investigation into what has been happening here? Members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children were informed that we would meet at 11 a.m., despite the fact that we normally meet at 9.30 a.m., and that the meeting would be in private to ensure the report could be released. When we went downstairs, there was chaos and nobody knew what was going on. We then came to the House but the Taoiseach did not explain the failure to abide by the basic procedures of the House. Is it because things have got so bad that the Department of Health and Children is refusing to co-operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made her point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Ceann Comhairle investigate this matter on behalf of all Members to ensure the procedures of the House are abided by, particularly by people who have questions to answer and are trying to evade them by not allowing questions tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to resume her seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle should allow me to ask a question. Does the Taoiseach agree that the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children should take place in public and Deputies should be enabled to ask questions on this saga?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I am asking you, a Cheann Comhairle, whether we can ask questions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is supposed to be a Parliament and there must be democratic accountability. Why can Deputies not put questions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>May I have an answer, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, the Ceann Comhairle prevented Deputy Neville from imparting to the House information which the Taoiseach and his incompetent group do not appear to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter does not arise. There is no such thing as a point of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>He then allowed other Deputies to speak at will. This is unfair and the Ceann Comhairle should be more balanced in his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Chair should listen carefully to Deputy Allen. One Member from each party is entitled to comment when a proposal is put before the House. Deputy Kenny spoke on behalf of the Fine Gael Party and a Member from each of the other parties spoke. When the Taoiseach had concluded the Chair &mdash; maybe the Chair was wrong and should take the Deputy&rsquo;s advice on the matter &mdash; allowed Deputy Kenny to speak a second time and each of the other parties to make another contribution. I will take note of Deputy Allen&rsquo;s point. He is correct that the Chair went outside the Standing Order and should not have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>While I welcome that the Travers report will be addressed in the House tomorrow, as anticipated, nevertheless what the Taoiseach is proposing does not go far enough. Statements are an inadequate way to address the import of the report and all that swirls about it. It is imperative that the House has a proper engagement with the Minister for Health and Children on it. Statements alone, which do not equate to debate, are an unsatisfactory response to a very important report. I ask the Taoiseach to <Col N="609"/>revisit the proposition that the House will have statements only tomorrow because it will not satisfy the needs in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, given that the Ceann Comhairle extended Standing Orders a little, will he extend them again to allow me to make a brief comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a point of order. I will put the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are we playing games when we should be talking about the real question? The Taoiseach is making a mockery of Deputies and should respond to the points we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond to the remarks made by Deputy Kenny at the outset of the debate. The advice of the Attorney General this morning was that procedurally the T&aacute;naiste could attend the committee meeting and that it was in order for her to give an oral briefing and then put the report before the House even before we passed a motion, but we should make sure there was privilege, that the motion should be passed on the Order of Business of that day. The only reason for No. <i>a</i>9 is to follow procedures and avoid confusion.</P>

	<P>Members may discuss the matter with the Whips today. I am trying to find an ordered way of getting the report into the public domain and properly before the House. That is what we propose to do in No. <i>a</i>9 and we can have the debate tomorrow. I have suggested there should be statements and the Whips may discuss that.

	<P>I call Deputy Rabbitte on the same issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of issues about which I will be asked in the United States. In lots of ways, I would, if I found the circumstances, get some clarity on them. I have been through this before and I know the committee and members on Capitol Hill will ask about them. The statement is an extraordinary one and while it is not our practice to comment, the only statement in which I am interested is the one made by the people when they voted for the Good Friday Agreement. That statement makes it clear there is no place for violence of any kind by any organisation here. As I said outside the House this morning, the latest statement is so outrageous and offensive that we must make our views clear on it. I would not mind if some of the people with whom I deal made some of those issues clear, so I could answer questions next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is very difficult to see how the Unionist population of Northern Ireland, whether represented by the Official Unionist Party or the Democratic Unionist Party, can enter into discussions to get devolved government in Northern Ireland against the backdrop of such a blatant manifestation of the republican movement&rsquo;s living in what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform quite properly called a twilight zone? This statement beggars all belief. The Taoiseach has been struggling to keep the door open to Sinn F&eacute;in. Unless there is a statement from the leadership of <Col N="614"/>the republican movement, which repudiates this statement and its implications and which takes a step towards the disbandment of the IRA, I cannot see how the Taoiseach can reasonably believe the Unionist population will respond to any initiatives in this regard?</P>
      <P>On the second matter, does the Taoiseach intend to be present for the debate tomorrow given the statements in this report that there is documentary evidence that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, briefed him on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The House has already made one decision today and has dealt with this matter on Leaders&rsquo; Questions. We had a long debate on it when we discussed the proposal before the House. It will be on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order Paper and then it will be appropriate to ask a question on the manner with which it will be dealt. We cannot go over the matter again.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there is a clear conflict of evidence between the Secretary General, who is apparently being removed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy cannot continue on this matter. I ask the Deputy to resume his seat. There must be order in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>There must, Sir, but there must be discussion on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue has been discussed by way of two Leaders&rsquo; Questions and it was discussed on a proposal before the House. The Chair has ruled that any discussion on tomorrow&rsquo;s debate arises on tomorrow&rsquo;s Order of Business and not on today&rsquo;s. I call Deputy Sargent on the issue of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will not be here tomorrow. I wish to ask whether there will be a facility to ask questions tomorrow given the conflict of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I have ruled the Deputy out of order. If he does not resume his seat, the Chair will deal with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has indicated he wishes to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I sat down because I thought the Taoiseach was going to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should resume his seat as the Chair is speaking. The Chair called Deputy Kenny who raised the issue of the IRA statement. I called Deputy Rabbitte and asked him if he wanted to speak on the same matter. He probably did not hear me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle harassed Deputy Kenny when he was putting the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I now call Deputy Sargent. I will call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and then I will hear the Taoiseach. It is a matter for the Taoiseach to reply to whatever he wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I will speak about tomorrow&rsquo;s debate in due course. I regard the IRA statement as gratuitous and quite insulting to put to the family of a murder victim. To offer them a further murder is incredible. Does the Taoiseach see merit in the request that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation undertake to allow civic society and society beyond the parties engaged in the process to involve itself in trying to bring about some consensus on how progress can be made and to allow people who have effectively felt silenced and sidelined to engage again and to generate a level of momentum which can get the pro<Col N="616"/>cess going once more? On that basis will the Taoiseach give consideration to the suggestion that the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation might have a role? It needs to be brought back on board, given the logjam that currently exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the most recent IRA statement on the murder of Robert McCartney, I want to register my disappointment on two counts. I am disappointed that a physical attack on those responsible was even contemplated. I am further disappointed that the IRA statement, which is a very detailed account of what occurred and a positive contribution to achieving the truth, has been, in the main, wilfully ignored. I urge people to re-evaluate it.</P>
      <P>I again commend the Sinn F&eacute;in president, Gerry Adams, for his continuing role in support of the McCartney family&rsquo;s search for truth and justice which I support 100%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On tomorrow&rsquo;s debate, as I said earlier, I thought we would have statements, but I am open to change that if Deputy Rabbitte believes it would be helpful if the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, answered questions and clarified the issues. I would be happy to arrange with the Government Whip to allocate part of the time available to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Kenny inquired about the issue involving Deputy Callely. In the discussions on the report Deputy Callely stated that the issue was mentioned to him and he noted on the side of the minute that he would raise it with me. He stated that during a vote on that day or some days after he mentioned to me that the issue of eligibility and entitlement was raised at the meeting and that the Department was seeking legal advice on the matter. That is what Deputy Callely raised and that is what it has been stated he raised. As part of the debate I will ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, to deal with the conflict between him and the Secretary General.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny also asked a question to which it is important to have an answer before I go to the United States, given that I will be asked questions there. I do not want to be anything other than helpful to the peace process. However, so many issues have been raised and statements made, and I say it calmly and not in any way to be unhelpful, that I need at least to be able to answer questions, and I will try to communicate with him in the next few days.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that all of this is making it increasingly difficult to deal with trust and confidence issues. I do not want to take issue with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in. I am trying hard to find aspects that are helpful and constructive. I hear and accept what the Deputy said. However, it is some weeks since I had the meetings. It is important for all of us in this House, without <Col N="617"/>exception, to recognise that it was the Irish people who made a statement in voting for the Good Friday Agreement. What we have all been trying to do in various ways is to ensure that is implemented. That statement makes clear that there is no place for violence of any kind by any organisation in this country, and there is more than one organisation that has, from time to time, been involved in violence. The latest statement by the IRA is outrageous and offensive.</P>

	<P>I met members of the McCartney family yesterday. Other Members of the House have also met them. I am aware that Deputy Kenny went to Belfast to meet them. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte and others have had similar meetings. We must get one thing straight once and for all. I say calmly that murder is murder, no matter who commits it. A crime is a crime, no matter who commits it. Everyone is equal before the law and innocent until proven guilty. Where a crime is committed it is investigated by the police, evidence is gathered, charges are brought and the accused receive a fair trial in an open court. We all believe in the rule of law, human rights and respect for the dignity of people. That is all the McCartneys want.</P>

	<P>That is what the Government wants. It is what everybody in this House wants. It is what the Irish people want. They want no more and no less. It is not complicated. We have been saying this endlessly for several weeks now. I am not interested in hearing whether this represents some positive move by the IRA. Neither do I want to take issue by saying it is not. I am not interested in hearing that it is somehow positive or that it is not a threat or that nothing was carried out and we should be happy about that. I am interested only in hearing an answer on the issues which stopped us after so much effort on 8 December. How do we sort out decommissioning of weapons? Are we finally at the end of paramilitary activity? Are we going to see and end to criminal activity? If we can get to that position we can move forward. If we cannot, we are in a hell of a mess. Those are the only answers we need.</P>

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be recommitted in its entirety to a committee of the House.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced a major change to the Bill by way of amendment No. 58 and there is a complete absence of opportunity for the House to debate this section in any detail owing to the presence of a guillotine.</P>
      <P>In the Bill as amended on Committee Stage, there is a section 141 which deals with the question of aiding and abetting tax evasion, as requested by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners on a number of occasions. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment, which we have only recently received, seeks to make the identification of aiding and abetting much more difficult. It will now have to involve somebody being reckless and culpability of a high degree. The bar has been set much higher regarding aiding and abetting than it was in the draft Bill.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in section 141(<i>b</i>), as amended in committee, there was a reference to somebody indirectly facilitating the fraudulent evasion of tax by any other person. I understood this, and so did other members of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service, as a particular attempt to capture, for example, officials or directors in banks or other institutions who were involved in establishing schemes to aid and abet tax evasion but who, as the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has pointed out, could not be successfully prosecuted. While on Committee Stage the Minister indicated he was considering the matter we received no notification until we <Col N="619"/>received the amendment as the Minister has tabled it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose that amendment No. 58 be grouped with amendment No.1 for the purpose of enabling the D&aacute;il to debate this important amendment. Because there is a guillotine attaching to this Bill, there will be no opportunity for the House to debate amendment No. 58. The least we are entitled to is that my proposal be facilitated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton&rsquo;s proposal is out of order. It is a matter for the Office of the Ceann Comhairle to make decisions on the grouping of amendments. The Chair has ruled on this matter and I ask Deputy Burton to move amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill will be guillotined at 1.30 p.m. tomorrow, which leaves us a relatively short time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Burton not to delay the proceedings further. The Chair has allowed her to make her point even though her motion is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about an amendment which deals with tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy to move the amendment. Amendment No. 1 arises out of Committee Stage. Amendment No. 5 is related and the two amendments may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">1.&mdash;The Ombudsman shall include in her annual report a special report on the overpayment of tax by PAYE taxpayers, and on the take up of credits by such taxpayers, and the branch of her office dedicated to ensuring that the take up of credits is readily available to all taxpayers, and refunds made as rapidly as possible where this arises, shall be known as the Taxpayers&rsquo; Advocate Office.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to oblige the Ombudsman to append to his or her annual report a special report on the overpayment of tax by PAYE taxpayers. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has come into the D&aacute;il with no prior notification of the detail of an amendment which serves basically to facilitate the tax evasion and tax avoidance industry. This represents a complete watering down of what the Minister promised at the initiation of the Bill and in the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 serves to represent those ordinary PAYE taxpayers who are at significant risk of receiving incorrect tax-free certificates <Col N="622"/>because of the way the system functions. The Minister acknowledged in the debate on Committee Stage that in the last year for which figures were available, more than &euro;300 million was due in refunds to PAYE taxpayers because of the absence of proper tax certification, either because of a change of business, employer or marital status, in the event of retirement, or following a transition from self-employment to employment or <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>In this scenario, compliant taxpayers, which includes the bulk of PAYE workers, are entitled to be facilitated by the Government in ensuring that where they overpay tax, there is a rapid right of recourse to the Revenue Commissioners and that the money is repaid easily and quickly. It is not good enough that the Revenue Commissioners are the judge and jury in this regard. The Labour Party has advocated the introduction of a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate, a person who will ensure that the ordinary taxpayer gets some justice.</P>
      <P>We know all about the tax avoidance schemes introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, for the very wealthy. The other side of the coin is that ordinary PAYE taxpayers are overpaying tax every year and are entitled to refunds totalling more than &euro;300 million. There has been no attempt by the Government to ensure that an independent office such as that of the Ombudsman should append an annual report which details the work of the Revenue Commissioners in this area.</P>
      <P>It is welcome that the Minister proposes in this Bill to extend the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; on-line services to PAYE taxpayers. However, this does not address the increasing problem of the significant numbers who are overpaying tax. The figures are small in percentage terms, representing approximately 2% of the total, but &euro;300 million is significant in anybody&rsquo;s language and is important to those affected. During the Committee Stage debate, the Minister found it difficult to understand that ordinary taxpayers may not be confident in dealing with the Revenue Commissioners and instead read out a list of offices, telephone numbers and other Revenue services throughout the country.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>There have been improvements in this regard but the provisions remain inadequate. There are many who do not deal properly with their tax affairs, either through fear or for some other reason. When people&rsquo;s circumstances change it is increasingly the case that they end up without the correct tax credits. If they are unaware of such errors, the Revenue Commissioners do not necessarily inform them of overpayments. What we advocate is a simple reform of the Office of the Ombudsman which would give her a duty of specifically reporting on this area.</P>
      <P>I have not even dealt with the matters, raised repeatedly here, of the various tax allowances available to PAYE taxpayers such as rebates on refuse charges, medical fees and expenses and other designated expenditure. All the evidence <Col N="623"/>suggests that a considerable number of PAYE taxpayers do not claim their entitlements to tax refunds on refuse charges and medical charges. Many general practitioners do not automatically give patients who pay medical fees a receipt. Many of the newer and group practices do, but to many individual doctors patient visits are considered a patient to doctor transaction and a full receipt is not made available.</P>
      <P>What the Labour Party proposes in this amendment is therefore reasonable. The Minister would not listen to this proposal but he could listen to the tax industry, the accountants industry and, in particular, the banking industry. All those old ladies in Longford and other places who took out a single premium insurance policy which was invested overseas and was improper in terms of tax compliance, did not come up with that idea. A bank clerk, and not necessarily one in the front office of the bank, made that suggestion. Banks set up these schemes with the specific objective of facilitating tax avoidance which turned out to be tax evasion. We know this from the report on deposit interest retention tax.</P>
      <P>As soon as the Minister had representations from various interests in banking, tax and accountancy advisory services, he significantly watered down what he told us he intended to do following the various scandals in terms of the recovery of many pots of gold. On the matter of tax evasion, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor was fond of saying there was no pot of gold and that most people paid all their taxes. While most people in the PAYE sector pay their taxes, the experience of the past five years shows that there has been not one but many pots of gold to be recovered by the Revenue Commissioners when they went after people who defaulted in their tax liability through DIRT and various other schemes facilitated by tax advisers, accountants and banks. To date, no official at a senior level in the banking industry has taken responsibility. No one has taken responsibility. Probably another 10,000 people will have to deal with single premium insurance investments.</P>
      <P>Whatever about a person coming up with the idea of opening a bank account abroad, a customer most definitely did not come up with the idea of the single premium investment policy which is to be investigated. I do not understand how the Minister can refuse to accept the Labour Party&rsquo;s reasonable amendment providing for a short report from the Ombudsman on PAYE taxpayers getting all the refunds to which they are entitled. At the behest of the tax advisory industry and banks, amendment No. 58 has been tabled, which significantly waters down what the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners calls for, namely, clear powers for the Revenue to prosecute the offence of aiding and abetting tax evasion and putting money overseas. The Minister has watered down provisions in that regard. He has also removed provisions from the Bill dealing with those who have indirectly facilitated <Col N="624"/>the fraudulent evasion of tax by any other person. If that is not a little Fianna F&aacute;il special for directors in banks, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is pure nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On that basis, the Minister should accept amendment No. 1 from the Labour Party. It is a minor amendment but it would at least balance the scales in terms of tax justice in favour of PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 5 also relates to this issue. We are talking about tens of thousands of PAYE workers who have tax deducted from their income on a weekly or monthly basis and at the end of the year have paid more tax than that for which they were liable. It has been estimated that in excess of &euro;300 million has been repaid, but a considerable number of taxpayers who have overpaid in terms of their tax contributions have not sought a refund of such overpayment.</P>
      <P>It will be difficult to bring taxpayers&rsquo; attention any more to the fact that they may have paid too much tax. Many people do not understand the tax system. That is the bottom line. They do not understand how tax credits work. I meet such people regularly in my clinic and I am sure many other Members have constituents call to their clinics with their tax documentation and P60s who do not have a clue about how their tax is computed. This is a major difficulty. I do not know how we will overcome this problem. I do not know how we will get people to realise how the system works, how their tax is computed, how they calculate whether they have paid too much tax and, if they have, how they reclaim the overpayment.</P>
      <P>The Minister will correctly advise that documentation is included with an assessment that is issued every year by Revenue, but generally people do not understand it. They receive a page informing them of their entitlements. Many of them are not able to understand it, they do not read it properly and they do not understand how the tax system works. How will we get to a position where such overpayments can be identified? The Minister needs to identify whether the system used by Revenue shows when a repayment is due to a taxpayer and whether it ensures a repayment is made without the taxpayer having to apply for it. I understand the computer system does not operate in that way and such a programme needs to be built into the existing system to ensure that safeguard is in place to ensure that taxpayers are issued with a tax refund in respect of overpayments of tax.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office figures should also be examined. When they are compared with the figures produced by Revenue, it is clear that some people are entitled to tax refunds. I have been of the view for many years that the question of family income supplement should be tied in with the Revenue Commissioners. When the Depart<Col N="625"/>ment of Social and Family Affairs examines the amount paid out in family income supplement and compares it with income returns across various bands of workers and so on, it is generally estimated by the Department that there is only approximately a 50% uptake of family income supplement compared with the figures relating to income returns. Surely this could also be tied in with the Revenue to ensure that if a person falls within a particular income level, family income supplement could be incorporated in conjunction with tax payments. In that way people who would fall within those categories would automatically get a refund, not of tax but in the form of a payout from Revenue. Would that not make much more sense and help to improve the system by ensuring people who pay their fair share of tax are not overcharged and do not have to go to the trouble of having to apply for a tax refund? Will the Minister consider those points? There is not a magic formula for ensuring that taxpayers who have paid too much tax get a tax refund. I suppose the system as it works will have to take some kind of initiative from the taxpayer. There may be a need for an information campaign to ensure that people have an easier understanding of tax affairs, such as the amount of tax they pay and the tax credits due to them.</P>
      <P>I would like to discuss the introduction of tax credits in recent years. I read recently that as few as 10% of people whose refuse is collected claim from the Revenue Commissioners the tax credit associated with refuse collection. I accept that the tax credit of &euro;40 for one&rsquo;s refuse collection is not much, but those who do not claim it are probably those who would benefit most from it. What is the level of uptake of the tax credit of approximately &euro;40 for trade union membership? I imagine that if one compared the number of trade union members in the country with the number of those who seek the tax credit associated with such membership, one would find that there is a major shortfall in that regard. Perhaps the Minister can give the relevant figures.</P>
      <P>There is a significant shortfall in the number of people applying for the tax credit to which they are entitled in respect of the annual health costs they incur when they pay for prescriptions, visits to the doctor and dental treatment, which can be extraordinarily high. I recently met a person who had been paying nursing home charges for a relative without realising that such charges are tax deductible. The person in question was paying tax at the higher rate of 42%. I do not know where the fault lies. We need to do a better job of informing people of their tax entitlements in a simplified way. Such people need to be told how to go about getting refunds of tax, for example. I ask the House to support amendment No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments before the House are the first of 61 amendments to be considered over approximately five hours. I am concerned that the House is being asked to deal on Report Stage with matters that were not discussed, or <Col N="626"/>properly discussed, on Committee Stage. A similar approach was adopted during the consideration of the other two Finance Bills with which I have been involved in the House. We need to ensure that legislation is presented to the House in a different manner in the future.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 has been tabled to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners accept and react properly to problems that have already been highlighted, such as the overpayment of tax and the shortfall in the take-up of tax credits. It is unfortunate that the Minister has not taken the opportunity presented by the Bill to introduce small and simple measures to alleviate the problems caused by the overpayment of tax. I appreciate that the amount of money gained in this way is a small percentage of the overall tax take. Individual taxpayers expect that the Government will spend their taxes wisely, but there are many examples of that not being done. It is expected that everyone should pay tax according to ability to pay, so that the tax burden is not over-extended. The extent to which repayments of tax are being made within a short period of time is open to question.</P>
      <P>We should examine the treatment of those who pay too much tax, which contrasts with the treatment of those who do not pay enough tax. I have suggested to the Minister that there should be equivalence, not only in terms of the level of interest paid on overpaid taxes, but in terms of the penalty clause that applies in such circumstances. The clause should apply to the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners just as it does to those who do not pay enough tax. I would like such proposals to be taken seriously in the future.</P>
      <P>Those who do not benefit from tax credits fall into three categories. I accept Deputy Burton&rsquo;s argument that the Government should play a greater role in making people aware of the credits available to them. Individual credits do not apply to a large group of people because of such people&rsquo;s circumstances. I am part of a smaller group of people who are aware of the existence of particular credits, such as the tax credit for refuse collection, but have chosen not to benefit from them. A significant group of people has access to tax credits but do not benefit from them for many reasons. They may not know how to apply for the credits or they may choose not to apply for them because they have a fear of the bureaucracy involved in the process. The Minister needs to take some action in this regard. Amendment No. 1 attempts to address such matters.</P>
      <P>To what extent is the budgetary analysis conducted in respect of taxation matters of this nature based on the expectation that small numbers of people will take up the tax credits made available under the tax system? Are the budget and the Finance Bill framed in the expectation that 10% or 20% of people will take up the tax credit for refuse collection, or a small percentage of people will benefit from the tax credit for health charges? Does the Government decide to sanc<Col N="627"/>tion certain credits on the basis of their cost to the State if everybody who is entitled to do so takes them up? If its analysis is conducted in the latter manner, the Department of Finance must be confident that the Exchequer will retain a certain amount of money in the course of the budgetary year. I ask the Minister to comment on that aspect of the matter in his response to Deputies&rsquo; contributions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s suggestion is in line with Green Party policy. The availability and take-up of tax credits could be dealt with more broadly if the taxation and social welfare systems were combined in a better way. Existing tax credits could be automatic, for example, or could be refundable if that were allowed by the individual taxpayer&rsquo;s circumstances. The information needed to make such changes is available, for example through the personal public service number system and the returns demanded by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in respect of every citizen in the State. It should not be an administrative problem to ensure that the State can make elements of tax credits refundable if they are assigned but not fully availed of. Such a system would bridge the gap between the taxation and social welfare systems. The Green Party believes the gap is contributing to the increasing social gap between those who have higher than average levels of wealth and income and those who do not. I ask the Minister to address this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, the Minister rejected my suggestion that the practice of the Revenue Commissioners, which involves vigorously pursuing taxpayers who are suspected of making under-payments while quietly ignoring those who have apparent and suspected over-payments, is a one-way street. He defended the steps taken by the Revenue Commissioners to inform the public of its taxation responsibilities and entitlements to tax credits. He refused to accept that the complexities of this country&rsquo;s tax regime are baffling for many people and that the website and printed matter vehicles employed to inform people about such matters are inaccessible or couched in prohibitive language that is simply unintelligible for many citizens.</P>
      <P>I support amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Burton and amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Paul McGrath. If the Minister continues to oppose the amendments, all we can do is to appeal directly to the Ombudsman and the Revenue Commissioners. One would not need a degree in English studies to put together a simple missive that would be sent to all taxpayers &mdash; the database is in place &mdash; asking the simple and salient questions in a very easily understood way. For instance, I suggest that the Revenue Commissioners prepare a circular, to be sent to all taxpayers subject to the PAYE code, asking a number of questions, including whether they have a mortgage, pay for health services, <Col N="628"/>including GP, dental and orthodontic care, and third level education fees, and, if so, a prompt response could save one money.</P>
      <P>People will appreciate the simplicity of such a document, with a series of questions in response to which one could tick a box indicating whether one falls into a particular category. That is not currently the practice, as I have confirmed since Committee Stage. We all receive missives from the Revenue Commissioners and they are not couched in simple terms. The office should state that if a taxpayer falls under any given category, such as those I have mentioned, he or she may be entitled to a refund of tax paid and a reduction in his or her future tax liability. By outlining in tabulated format the range of areas that would qualify for tax credits we would assist enormously in promoting a wider, more universal understanding of the working of the tax regime.</P>
      <P>I do not know about other Deputies, but I do not receive as many queries on this matter as I do in respect of many other matters of concern in my constituency. That reflects that people just do not know the questions to ask. I have no doubt, however, that if a missive such as the one I suggest were sent to taxpayers, people would look for assistance in assessing whether it applied to them. I have no doubt that elected representatives, at Oireachtas and local authority levels, would be very happy to assist their fellow citizens in that regard. Of course, there are those who give professional advice but unfortunately the advice of the greater number of these professionals cannot be afforded by ordinary citizens, by and large, the people of whom I speak in the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>There is good sense in both of the amendments. Their purpose is to try to ensure the more equitable and fair taxation practice, whereby people are entitled to tax credits, reductions in their liability and, in the case of many people, rebates of tax paid over years past. The Minister has a responsibly regarding this Bill to set in train what is necessary for the Revenue Commissioners to meet their responsibilities regarding the fairness we all wish to see in the tax regime in this State.</P>
      <P>I commend both amendments to the Minister. I hope the offices of the Ombudsman and the Revenue Commissioners will take note of the contributions of Deputies right across the Opposition benches today and previously. In the event of the Minister not accepting the amendments, he should take on board the very sane and reasonable arguments presented and adopt them in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the attention of Deputies to the need for a versional correction to section 52(1)(<i>b</i>) on page 96 of the Finance Bill, as amended in select committee. The word &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; was omitted inadvertently and should be inserted at the beginning of line 14. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to direct the Clerk <Col N="629"/>to make the correction, as provided under Standing Order 134.</P>
      <P>Let us now consider the amendments. As has been said, we had a long debate and discussed in some detail the matter of how the Revenue Commissioners do their best to ensure people are aware of their entitlements. They have been very proactive in this area, using every mechanism and technology at its disposal, including post, text messaging, free lines, telephone lines and forms. It has exploited the possibility of downloading forms from websites. It has used every possible means by which reasonable inquiries can be made by taxpayers into their entitlements. The Revenue Commissioners obviously have a vested interest in ensuring people have all the information required because this obviously allows for correct returns and ensures that all accounts are in order. The Revenue is doing all it is being asked to do, in every possible way.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 5, which are being considered together, deal with unclaimed PAYE overpayments. As I stated, we had a comprehensive debate on Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment on this topic last week. I did not accept her suggested use of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office in the manner proposed in the amendment and I rejected any suggestion that the Revenue Commissioners had a vested interest in ensuring that taxpayers are not fully informed of their entitlements.</P>
      <P>While I do not want to repeat all I said on Committee Stage, it is important that I re-emphasise a few points on the subject of overpayments by PAYE taxpayers. The Revenue Commissioners do all in their power, through various means, to ensure taxpayers are informed regularly of their entitlements and given, on request, all appropriate advice on their tax affairs. Revenue&rsquo;s customers can expect to be given the necessary information and all reasonable assistance to enable them to claim their entitlements. This is Revenue&rsquo;s commitment and it takes it very seriously.</P>
      <P>There is no policy of deliberately over-collecting tax. Revenue administers the law fairly, reasonably and consistently and seeks to collect no more than the correct amount of tax. To pay the correct amount of tax under the PAYE system or to receive repayments due, the taxpayer must inform the office of his or her full entitlements. The PAYE system requires this information if it is to operate as intended.</P>
      <P>There is no crock of gold in unclaimed repayments due to taxpayers, as suggested in some quarters. In respect of the 2003 tax year, 287,258 PAYE taxpayers, amounting to 17% of the total PAYE taxpayer base of 1.6 million, have so far made claims or requested reviews of their tax position. Of these reviews, 8% identified underpayments, 17% resulted in no change and 75% resulted in repayments being made. No repayment was due to one in four of those who requested reviews and one third of those to whom no repayment was due had underpaid. A sum of &euro;185 million has been paid and this figure could <Col N="630"/>eventually rise to approximately &euro;306 million based on estimates and experience. These figures should be considered in the context of a total PAYE revenue bill of &euro;7.2 billion in that year. Repayments of tax for 2003 that have yet to be made, and will be made as soon as claims are received from the taxpayers concerned, amount to less than 2% of PAYE receipts for the year.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that where a taxpayer has overpaid tax for a given year through the PAYE system, he or she is in the best position to know this. In many instances, the taxpayer will be the only person who knows that tax has been overpaid. It is simply incorrect to suggest, despite all the evidence, that the Revenue Commissioners are not doing enough to inform taxpayers of their entitlements and creating another layer of bureaucracy which will divert resources in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and will not alert taxpayers to their entitlements or hasten their claims to repayment. As in the public sector generally, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit covers the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment, I understand that the view of the Central Statistics Office is that the data collected by that organisation on household incomes and expenditure patterns are not sufficiently comprehensive or detailed to identify potential overpayments. Moreover, many of the data are only collected at five-yearly intervals and on a sample basis.</P>

        <Quest>how she intends to deal with the provision of permanent school accommodation in areas of major population growth; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the policy of my Department to provide a permanent accommodation solution in so far as possible to meet the demands presenting for schools in areas of major population growth. However, the time span involved in architectural design and obtaining planning permission processes effectively means that in all instances it may not be possible to provide a permanent accommodation solution as soon as it is required. In these cases temporary accommodation is provided as an interim measure.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the pressures being placed on education providers in areas of major population <Col N="631"/>growth. To this end my Department is prioritising the provision of new and enhanced educational facilities in these areas. The prioritisation criteria, which were recently revised in consultation with the education partners allocates a top priority band 1 rating to school building projects in such areas.</P>
        <P>My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course, meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision so as to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of the required education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>In recent years my Department has worked to strengthen contacts with local authorities to facilitate informed decisions on planning future educational provision. For example, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by officials of my Department, interacts with the Dublin local authorities. This forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin, together with representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools and it monitors demographic changes and their likely impact.</P>
        <P>The school planning section of my Department also works with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation minimises my Department&rsquo;s land requirements and thus reduces site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities. Under the provisions of the strategic development zones it is generally the position that sites must be reserved for schools and also that the schools must be developed in line with the housing and other developments.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently adopted an area-based approach to school planning where, through a public consultation process involving the education partners, a blueprint for schools&rsquo; development in an area for a ten year time frame can be set out. The areas covered in the pilot phase of this area-based approach to school planning include north Dublin, south Louth and mid-Meath; the N4-M4 route running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan, including Maynooth, Celbridge, Kilcock, Edenderry and rapidly developing villages and towns on that route. Taken in combination these measures will improve the speed and effectiveness of the response to emerging needs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>A ten-year timeframe at this stage is too little too late. There has been an appalling lack of planning in the past and we must learn from previous disastrous decisions to ensure that cannot happen again. Does the Minister agree that the present emergencies must be dealt with now?</P><Col N="632"/>
        <P>Is the Minister aware of the situation in places such as Johnstown outside Navan, Ballivor, Navan and Ratoath, which is a prime example of the problem? What can the Minister say to a school with 940 pupils? She will probably be there to open a &euro;4 million extension later in the year but the school will remain one classroom short at current growth rates. What can be done in such situations? There is a school in Gorey, County Wexford which caters for twice the number of pupils for which it was built, as Deputy Kehoe can confirm.</P>
        <P>We must ensure we can deal with these emergencies. A ten-year time frame is a nice idea in places where population growth is about to start but in places such as those I have named already experiencing serious problems, something more urgent must be done. Other places, such as Enfield, Lismullen and Coole are in a disastrous position and the parents are frustrated at the lack of action. They cannot wait ten years, which is the cycle of primary school education, so where can they go? In many of these areas the answer is simply, nowhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The demographics for some of the areas around Dublin reached their projected numbers years in advance of the dates given in the census. For that reason five new primary schools in Kildare have been recognised, three in Meath and two in Dublin, of the counties the Deputy mentioned. This is the type of initiative we take as an immediate response.</P>
        <P>The Deputy mentioned Ratoath where an extension to cater for the senior students of the primary school will open in September and already there are plans for a third school there. I visited there recently and saw that end of the county is well served by educational developments and extensions. More provision is needed in some other counties such as Wexford, Westmeath and Laois which are within an hour or 90 minutes&rsquo; drive of Dublin, and demand has grown.</P>
        <P>One anticipated that new building would bring young couples with new families in four or five years&rsquo; time, instead, five schools on the north side of Dublin have closed while there is a demand for schools in Meath. Whole families move in May and need school places in September. We must react to this. That is why we are investing so much in extensions to schools and pursuing sites in other situations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What time frames does this involve for a school such as Johnstown, which is newly recognised? How long does the Minister envisage such a school in a major growth area must wait because ten years is too long? The school cannot provide and teach the new curriculum in its present situation. That is only one example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to speak about any one school. I would not envisage a ten year wait for a school that is recognised. The funding for <Col N="633"/>this year alone for the schools&rsquo; modernisation and building programme is &euro;493 million of which &euro;270 million will go into primary schools.</P>
        <P>Is the Deputy referring to the Johnstown, Kill school?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to Johnstown in Navan but it is probably the same in Johnstown in Kill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are problems regarding sites which are tied up with rezoning. I have witnessed situations where the politicians calling for new schools vote against the rezoning of the only available site in the area. There are planning issues and problems of infrastructure, development and provision. I do not envisage any delay for new schools because they get priority 1 status.</P>

        <Quest>if she will clarify her plans for proposed changes to special education support in view of the growing concern among parents and teachers at the implications of circular SP ED 09/04 for children with special needs; if she has consulted with schools on this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories.</P>
        <P>My predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, announced a model in 2004, which was due to come into effect this year but we have reviewed that model. The aim was to place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model based on numbers and which takes into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and that boys have greater difficulties than girls was the one devised.</P>
        <P>There are advantages to using a general allocation model. It ensures there is early intervention because the resources are in place in the school when a child enrols. It reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments. It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. It gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option. It allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services. It will automatically adjust a school&rsquo;s general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment. The principle of having a general allocation is a good one for the reasons I have outlined. However, the particular model <Col N="634"/>which was announced indicated that there would be particular difficulties for small, rural and disadvantaged schools. For that reason, a review is under way which it is hoped will be completed over the next few weeks. This has involved consultation with the representative interests, including the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>In regard to resources next year for children in the lower incidence disability categories, resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications. It is important that where there is a particular special need in the low incidence category, these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools. Therefore, the general model would be inappropriate for them. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the special educational needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. This issue has been raised on a number of occasions. I am sure her back bench colleagues will have made her aware of the serious disquiet that exists on this issue. I recently attended a meeting in Scoil Coca Naofa, Kilcock, to which all the candidates were invited in the context of the by-election. We heard at first hand the concerns of parents and teachers, including special needs teachers and the principal of the school, that children who have been assessed as being in need of resources and who now have them will have them diluted. Has the Minister listened to some of these parents and teachers regarding their real and individual concerns?</P>
        <P>The Minister said that children would receive the service appropriate to their needs. Does that mean that a child who has two and a half hours&rsquo; one-to-one support and has been assessed as needing this support will continue to have that level of support from September 2005? There are concerns that where resources are in place and the system is working well on the basis of the figures in the weighted scheme, schools would lose teachers and resource hours and children would lose out. Will the Minister address these concerns and ensure children do not lose the resources they need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I met the principal of the school to which Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan referred and also the principals and boards of management representing schools in west Limerick. I was happy to receive submissions from various groups to revise our thinking on the matter. I always believe in listening to people. I have received recommendations from organisations such as the National Council for Special Education and partners in education.</P>
        <P>We said that children will receive a service according to their needs. The needs of children change each year. Just because a child needed a particular resource in senior infants does not necessarily mean he or she will need it in second <Col N="635"/>class. I hope these children will not continue to need these resources and that their educational development will be such that they will be able to address their problems and issues. The aim is to ensure that children who need a service will receive it. The problem is trying to find an allocation that can cater for all the needs of small and rural schools in particular which share teachers. We want to address the problem of people having to drive from one end of a county to another.</P>
        <P>An issue that came to light in some schools was the differential in the allocation between boys and girls. There should be a greater allocation for boys because all the international literature and all the national and international surveys indicate that there are greater needs and difficulties among boys than among girls. We must address that kind of evidence and information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>In her reply about children getting what they need, does it mean that the poor unfortunate principals will have to make a decision in September if they do not have sufficient resources? Where a child had two and a half hours&rsquo; one-to-one support, will the principal now have to decide the child does not need it anymore or can they get the resources from the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many instances where principals must decide on the deployment of resources. We appointed 2,600 additional resource teachers in recent years to deal with the issues and difficulties to which we have referred. A child who has a specific need and who falls within the low incidence or more severe category will continue to get exactly what was allocated to him or her. What we are talking about in this model is the mild and borderline mild general learning disability. We must cater for their needs by having that service in place. I hope to be in a position to announce the allocation over the next few weeks. However, it is proving quite difficult to come up with a model.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the need to reduce class sizes, particularly at primary level, in view of Ireland&rsquo;s poor position in EU terms; her views on international evidence collated recently by the INTO which points to the huge benefits of smaller classes; her plans to improve the pupil-teacher ratio over the next five years, notwithstanding investments in special needs assistants and resource teachers; the steps being taken to roll out more graduates; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[7940/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. While some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than <Col N="636"/>29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in the 1996-7 school year. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all teachers in the school, including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-7 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Some 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas and in junior classes. The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly because of the creation of the large number of posts which I have outlined. The difficulties being experienced were aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career breaks and job-sharing schemes.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years. Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the BEd programme in the colleges of education. Since the 1995-6 academic year, an 18 month postgraduate course has been provided in the colleges. The total intake to the colleges of education in the current academic year is approximately 1,280 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-7. There are 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. In addition, graduates of the new primary teacher training course, which is being accredited by HETAC and delivered by Hibernia College, an on-line third level educational company, will be recognised for the purposes of primary teaching.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that more than 80% of approximately 210,000 to 220,000 children under the age of nine in classes ranging from junior infants up to second class are in classes of more than 20? International evidence indicates that smaller class sizes can benefit a <Col N="637"/>child&rsquo;s reading and language development skills, mathematics and artistic development. It also indicates that teachers who are able to spend more time teaching can benefit children under the age of nine and prepare them for the work ahead. Studies have shown that people who complete their leaving certificate and go to college earn more money and pay more in tax.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contained a pledge that over the next five years the Government would progressively introduce maximum class size guidelines to ensure the average size of classes for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1. Is the Government admitting that it has broken that promise and that it will remain broken until the next election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to international evidence on smaller class sizes and the Government accepts that smaller class sizes at junior level can make a difference. There is no evidence, however, to show that smaller class sizes further up the line can make a real difference to educational achievement. The international level was recently cited by the INTO in its magazine in an article that also shows the reduction in class size must be accompanied by a change in teaching styles to achieve all of the benefits. Teacher quality and the work he or she is doing in the classroom is even more significant than the size of the class. The two must go hand in hand.</P>
        <P>Our priority must be disadvantaged areas. We want to ensure children in those areas are targeted and that is backed up by changes in teaching methods. In the Breaking the Cycle element of the disadvantage programme, there is a class size of 15:1 but in the evaluation, improvements in literacy and numeracy were not generally attained and, unfortunately, in some areas it was found that there was even some decline in attainment despite the small class size. My priority is to aim to meet the target in the programme for Government but that will be done in the context of the availability of resources and teachers and the priorities for me are special needs and disadvantage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister acknowledge that many pupils are disadvantaged even when their school is not in a disadvantaged area and, in terms of class sizes, they must also be dealt with? Whatever about the Minister&rsquo;s aspirations to meet the commitments in the programme for Government, so far the promise has remained unfulfilled. In economic terms, Ireland has the third largest class sizes in the EU and our future economic and social development will be in jeopardy unless the issue is addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The same tables also show that educational achievement in Ireland is much higher than in those states with smaller class sizes.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="638"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It is higher in spite of the larger class sizes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That bears out that class size is not the only contributor to educational achievement. It remains our aim and part of the programme for Government but it will be done in the context of targeting those most in need with teachers and available resources.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multifaceted strategy to tackle the issue.</P>
        <P>The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills, including self awareness, respect for others, self esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the Myself and Others strand from infants classes onwards. In second level education, bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle in the module on belonging and integrating.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="639"/>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>What evaluation has the Department carried out of the success rate of the SPHE anti-bullying element? Has the Minister seen statistics reflecting a reduction in bullying? Is the Minister aware of the programme carried out by Dr. Mona O&rsquo;Moore in Trinity College and that an evaluation of it showed a reduction of 50% among those frequently victimised and a reduction of 69.2% in reports of those frequently carrying out bullying? That was properly evaluated and shows a high level of success. This pilot project was allowed to get off the ground in 1998 in response to a sad tragedy that occurred as a result of bullying and we all know of other tragedies in similar circumstances.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister feel current provision is sufficient? If the Department felt such a project was necessary in 1998 and if it has been shown to be so successful it has been adopted by the Norwegian Government, why have we not allowed it to expand to the extra 140 schools? It is not even a huge financial burden. Why could we not find &euro;26,000 in the resources of the Department of Education and Science to allow for a video that has also been successful to go out to schools? Why can we not facilitate some level of in-service training to allow this to roll out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I personally have noticed a distinct change since I was a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science with special responsibility for children on the whole issue of bullying. When I visited schools then, bullying was the number one issue but now in any of my dealings with the children whom we have consulted it does not come up as an issue. That is striking and the reason for that is it is being tackled at school level &mdash; because children are more aware of it, more vocal about it and involved in it, they are not highlighting it as a problem while realising they must deal with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>That is anecdotal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No. This is as a result of the various policies, seminars, guidelines that have been issued, the pilot projects that exist and the fact that all schools are now required to have an anti-bullying policy. The best way to deal with this is in the context of the code of behaviour of the individual school which would be signed up to by staff, parents and children. That makes the penalties and sanctions clear to each student and informs him or her of the attitude of the school to bullying and it is having a real impact.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with the anti-bullying programme in Trinity College, which is one of many pilot projects. The Cool School anti-bullying project in the former North Eastern Health Board area is being implemented in 80% of schools in Counties Meath, Louth, Cavan and Monaghan and the pilot project from the Navan Education Centre is also being extended.</P>
        <P>The Trinity College programme was funded by my Department based on the Norwegian model. <Col N="640"/>Last year, well into the academic year, after the school in-service programme had been arranged, the TCD centre sought funding to be included in this year and it was far too late to do it. Last year, during the summer, we gave approval, despite a late application, to run a summer course in Trinity College for preventing and countering bullying behaviour in schools&rsquo; practical intervention work.</P>
        <P>We are open to considering all programmes that might be of benefit. It is important this is done in conjunction with the SPHE programme and the schools&rsquo; development planning initiative to support all of the work being undertaken. At the end of 2004, DCU also published research on bullying and the effect of the anti-bullying measures.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which she proposes to address the growing problem of inadequate provision of school places for children in areas of expanding population, especially in Dublin and the counties bordering Dublin; if she will pursue with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the possibility of having the Planning and Development Act 2000 amended to make sites for schools available at affordable prices; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am conscious of the issues raised by the Deputy and in particular the pressures for places in some schools and colleges in the greater Dublin area and in those areas within commuting distance of Dublin which are experiencing major population growth. To this end my Department is prioritising the provision of new and enhanced educational facilities in these areas. The prioritisation criteria which were recently revised in consultation with the education partners allocates a top priority band one rating to school building projects in such areas.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course, meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of the required education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>The areas covered in the first phase of this approach to school planning include north Dublin, south Louth and mid-Meath in one plan and a separate plan for the N4-M4 route running from Leixlip to Kilbeggan and including Maynooth, Celbridge, Kilcock, Edenderry and rapidly developing villages and towns on that route.</P><Col N="641"/>
        <P>In regard to the availability and costs of sites for school buildings, the Deputy will be aware of the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. All these measures taken in combination will enable us to build on the progress made to date and respond ever more effectively to emerging need.</P>
        <P>The Deputy has also raised the matter of site acquisition and ensuring that sites are available at affordable prices. The position is that my Department, working with the local authorities, causes land to be reserved for school development in particular areas. While it would be fair to say that the cost of sites impacts on the overall capital envelope available for school buildings, it is important to note that the question of acquiring suitable land <i>per se</i> rarely in practice slows up the delivery of a school building project in a rapidly developing area.</P>
        <P>There is an issue whether my Department ends up paying a fair and reasonable price for school sites and what contribution, if any, a developer should make. The provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 do not place an onus on developers to provide school sites other than at market rates. I am keeping an open mind as to whether legislative change might be of assistance or prove the best way forward. Any changes in this area would require careful consideration in the context of constitutional protection for private property and in weighing up how any reduction in the price per acre of any land given for schools development might impact on the unit costs and affordability of houses developed on the remaining lands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In our recommendations we said it would be possible to have land made available for educational purposes at affordable prices without affecting the Constitution and we got legal advice on that issue. It costs the Department money that could otherwise be spent on school buildings, expansions and so on. It is a matter of public accountability that we try to buy land for schools at prices that are not inflated. I am aware that Educate Together met the Minister recently and made that point.</P>
        <P>Given the recent dramatic expansion in population, does the Minister agree that not having a proactive approach in the Department of Education and Science and waiting for local communities to get organised for new schools affects children and parents and their opportunity to be in schools of a reasonable size with decent classrooms? A report in her Department suggests that within the next 15 years, primary enrolments will increase from the current level of fewer than 450,000 to approximately 600,000 and that second level enrolments will increase from 335,000 to 405,000. Are there plans in the Department to be more proactive in assuming the role of setting up new schools and supporting local communities rather than expecting schools to start up in scout halls, rugby clubs and all kinds of unsuitable <Col N="642"/>accommodation until such time as they reach a certain size?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s first point on the issue of sites, I would like to see a situation where a developer had to make a site available at low or no cost to the Department of Education and Science. However, I want to ensure he does not then hike up the price of houses. That said, it may be worth it for those people to have children in their schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be made a condition of the rezoning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The legal advice is that one cannot make it a condition of the rezoning. That issue would have to be examined because a property right is involved. In fairness, there are local authorities, such as Fingal County Council, which are being extraordinarily helpful to us to ensure the Department does not end up paying large sums of money. There can be a programme through which community facilities are provided and that can link in with the developer&rsquo;s work. On the other side there are some developers who offer to make contributions towards the building of schools. In an area which will be a new town of 20,000 people, a developer said he would provide a four-teacher school which would not go far in meeting the need.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second question related to planning generally. A new group or patron is not allowed to set up a school in a scout hall. It must be able to show it can develop and grow within the site during the coming years. The area development plans and the commission on schools is one way of ensuring proper development and plans for an area. It is through that committee we have seen applications being made, following notification, public consultation, identification of the real need and temporary or permanent recognition, leading to the provision of a school in an area. That system has worked well, particularly in some of the new areas, and I have mentioned some of the new schools which have been provided as a result. There is also the development of gaelscoileanna and Educate Together so that planning for the future is being looked at in many different ways and not just from the point of view of demographics. The difficulty is not that we do not have school buildings but that some happen to be in the wrong places.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 69 together.</P>
        <P>I recently established a task force to consider and report on the issue of student behaviour in second level schools. The task force is chaired by Dr. Maeve Martin of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth. I want the work of this task force to provide a solid foundation for developing policies and best practice in our schools into the future. The task force will link closely to a wide range of interests across the education system on this important issue.</P>
        <P>A consultative group is also to be formed comprising all the partners in education and allowing for their input to the deliberations of the task force. In addition, I have asked that the task force constitute fora of teachers, parents and students with a view to testing emerging ideas and proposals. The task force recently invited, by public advertisement, submissions from interested individuals and groups. There have been four meetings of the task force to date and other meetings are planned.</P>
        <P>Two consultative fora have been organised, the first in Cork on 14 March and the second in Galway on 21 March. The chairperson and three of the task force members will attend. The planned format is to meet separate groups of teachers, parents and students with a member of the task force acting as rapporteur for each group. This will then be followed by a plenary session which will be chaired by Dr. Martin. The task force will wait to see how this format works before organising any further such fora but it is certainly envisaged that more will be convened. A number of submissions have been received, a number of organisations have indicated their intention to make submissions and there is still plenty of time before the deadline of 31 March 2005.</P>
        <P>I have asked the task force to make recommendations by June 2005 with a view to having them implemented by the beginning of the next academic year. I have also asked the task force to complete its work by the end of 2005. However, it may produce interim reports to highlight various issues of analysis and research.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will be surprised to hear me say, &ldquo;Well done, Minister&rdquo;. I welcome that the task force has been set up and I hope the timeframes will be adhered to while acknowledging they are tight. What issues will be examined? A number of alternatives to regular schooling have been set up in various parts of the country for children who have difficulty in settling in to regular school. Approximately 1,000 children drop out and do not go on to second level schools. The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, who is present, will be aware of one such <Col N="644"/>school in County Clare. These alternatives to regular schooling are scattered throughout various parts of the country, some of which work well and others which do not. Will that issue be examined by the task force?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister envisage amending the legislation, although it may be too early to say at this stage? Obviously there are conflicting rights &mdash; the rights of the children who have difficulties in schools, the rights of the other children in the schools, the rights of teachers and so on. Will this require amending legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am well aware of the various types of education centres providing an education for so many young people throughout the country. Those groups are represented on this task force to ensure a broad range of views and experience. A recently retired principal teacher on the Youth Encounter project in Limerick city is a member of the group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>A very good person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree, as are all the members of the task force. The task force will consider various issues. The Deputy is correct in that it is a balance of rights, between the individual student and the rest of the students in the class and a balance of rights between the teacher and the right of the teacher to be able to work within that environment. It is to ensure the creation of an educational environment in which everybody can work.</P>
        <P>The immediate cry from everybody was for a change in the legislation. I am not satisfied that changing the legislation alone is the answer. Obviously codes of behaviour and proper procedures in the school and proper classroom management can add a lot as can ensuring that students are following a course of study appropriate to them, whether that be the LCVA or various other programmes on offer in schools. Young people should be guided to ensure they are meeting their own needs to allow them to reach their potential.</P>
        <P>If it is suggested that a change in legislation would improve the situation for people, then I am certainly open to considering that as part of an overall package that aims to put in place a better school environment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Is any expert on bullying a member of this task force? Will the task force examine this issue? I have been informed that behaviour learned at a very early age develops and transfers on to second level education where such children not only bully their peers but also the teachers in many instances. Will this form part of the remit of the task force?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I deliberately called it a task force on student behaviour, which is quite a wide definition. People are invited to make submissions on anything that relates to this subject. <Col N="645"/>I know the task force will be very happy to consider them. The members of the task force are practitioners in all the various sectors of education. They represent parents, teachers, principals and people outside the mainstream education sector and people identified as top class practitioners in their own right. The ASTI and the TUI both asked for this task force to be set up and have expressed their willingness to work very closely with it. I am quite satisfied that anything that would refer to student behaviour can and will be examined by the group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree there are significant discipline problems in some schools in the State? Will she agree that something must be done about children from crisis families or dysfunctional situations as they often bring these social problems into the classroom? What is the Minister&rsquo;s response to these types of children? I emphasise these children are in the minority in primary schools and the very severe cases would account for approximately 200 to 300 children nationally. If there is no early intervention they are the children who will become involved in drugs and crime and eventually end up in prison. This aspect of the discipline problem must also be tackled.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s response that classroom management is a very important aspect of discipline. Effective teaching is another angle to discipline. We are all familiar with examples of good practice in difficult schools where a good class teacher can turn the whole community and school. Has the Minister any future plans to reward the good practice of those teachers, particularly those in disadvantaged areas?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McGrath has expressed it quite well. The teacher in the classroom is the person who should be in control and should have the skill to deal with the wide range of issues that arise. The terms of reference of the task force refer to the issue of disruptive students as it impacts on teaching and learning, the effectiveness of strategy at present, in other words, looking at best practice which can then be shared. Any teacher will appreciate being given information on best practice and current strategies. The task force will advise on best practice nationally and internationally. It will make recommendations on how to promote an improved climate for teaching and learning.</P>
        <P>I wish to make it clear that the task force is dealing with second level education. It is quite true to say that students cannot leave their families, their society and their problems at the school gate and much of what is happening in the classroom is a reflection of difficulties they are dealing with outside. This is the reason the work of the National Educational Welfare Board, the education psychologists and the wider family support is crucially important in this regard. I refer to positions such as the home-school liaison teacher, which can also be very important. I regard this <Col N="646"/>task force as being a whole school approach to dealing with school behaviour. I look forward to getting the group&rsquo;s recommendations and implementing them quickly.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>The number of children within the primary education system is in the region of 446,000 pupils and increasing. Arising from the census of special needs provision undertaken by my Department towards the end of 2003, there were 4,527 pupils within the mild general learning disability range, and 2,450 within the borderline mild general learning disability range. In general, this pupil cohort would be eligible for resource teaching support. The census was undertaken in 2003 to ensure that up to date information on children with special educational needs was available to the Department. The establishment of the National Council for Special Education will be of great assistance in ensuring that such information is available on an ongoing basis in the future.</P>
        <P>The scale of resource allocation in recent years has facilitated the provision of education for children with special needs, including those with mild or borderline mild general learning disabilities, in mainly mainstream national schools. However, education for children with special educational needs is provided in a variety of settings. For children for whom mainstream provision is not appropriate, placement may be made in one of the 30 special schools and the 289 special classes catering for pupils with mild general learning disability located throughout the country. These classes have a pupil teacher ratio of 11:1.</P>
        <P>In 1998, the Government took a decision that has transformed the level of provision for pupils with special educational needs, including those with mild and borderline mild general learning disabilities. Pupils with such needs would be entitled to an automatic response to meet those needs and the allocation of resources to meet those needs no longer depended, as it had in the past, on the limited resources that were available to meet those needs.</P>
        <P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education <Col N="647"/>system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests aims to introduce a general allocation model. It is hoped to have an outcome in the next few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>In answer to a parliamentary question I received a response from the Minister stating that a child would be dealt with under the new weighted system when it comes into being next September. Will children with specific learning disabilities lose the two and a half hours per week they currently have? I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the point that if a child with a mild or borderline disability is given the assistance he or she requires at the time they need it, he or she may require significantly less assistance in the longer term. If they do not receive what is required now, does the Minister appreciate that in the long term they will require a greater investment? When considering the weighted system I ask the Minister to give consideration to that fact and to ensure that the children receive the assistance they require. It is important that persons with a low incidence of disability are also given what they require but one sector cannot be favoured at the expense of ignoring almost 7,000 children in the other sector. Children under that system will lose out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is certainly not the intention to ignore such children. Those children will be included in an allocation that will ensure that resource teaching will be available in the school even before the child joins the school. This is to avoid a child having to wait until first or second class or even beyond before a need might be identified. Resource teaching will be available in the school as soon as the teacher notes that extra assistance might be needed by a child. The aim, therefore, is to arrive at a position in which need will be targeted recognising that a percentage of the population, estimated to be around 3%, needs specific allocation, while approximately 10% of the populace is acknowledged to have learning difficulties in literacy and numeracy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to increase the number of resource teachers? While I am aware that an additional 350 resource teachers are working in the education sector this year, the system cannot possibly work as she envisages with current resource teacher numbers. Does she envisage that more resource teachers will enter the system next September?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, 2,600 extra resource teachers entered the system in recent years. A further 350 were assigned under this model and the Department is determining whether more will be needed. At the same time as reducing class sizes, as Deputies and others ask me to do, we must ensure this issue is addressed and it will be a priority.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="648"/>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the weighted system, as proposed in special education circular 90/4, the document refers to a third category of learning disability in addition to the two mentioned in the question. I understand it is described as &ldquo;specific learning disability&rdquo; and includes dyslexia and some other conditions. The figures provided by the Minister relate to mild and mild borderline learning disability. Does she have figures on the third category?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have figures to hand. The 3% figure to which I referred relates to the specific high incidence group. The task force on dyslexia recognised that the teacher, in the first instance, would identify a need and refer a child to a learning support in the school. If this did not work, the teacher would call in a NEPS psychologist to evaluate what further needs should be met. The matter will be tackled in the first instance through learning support.</P>
        <P>In addition to 2,600 resource teachers, 1,500 learning support teachers work in our schools. With this kind of allocation, we should be able to meet the more general needs of our children, while the needs of children with high incidence needs will continue to be addressed separately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that some parents of children with disabilities continue to experience problems enrolling their children? Families of children with autism, in particular, are encountering major difficulty obtaining places in primary school.</P>
        <P>We all welcome the targeting of resources on the most needy, particularly in disadvantaged communities. Is it not time to move on to support children with disabilities in the broader school system? Does the Minister accept that every child only gets one shot at the education system and needs must, therefore, be provided for at an early age?</P>
        <P>Is the Minister aware that many teachers complain about the bureaucracy associated with learning supports? For example, teachers are pulled out of classrooms to attend meetings and case conferences, with the result that service for children with disability is diminished.</P>
        <P>As regards the figure of 1,500 learning support teachers, will a plan be produced in the coming years to determine the effect of these additional resources on pupils with disabilities in mainstream primary schools?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for his interest in this issue. I am not aware of specific complaints about children not being able to gain access to primary schools. Under section 29 of the Act, parents can appeal to the Department if their children are refused enrolment. Parents need to be aware of this provision because our aim is to ensure that those who want their children in mainstream education are facilitated. Resources have been available for this purpose, which is the reason that, in addition to the <Col N="649"/>teachers to whom I have referred, we have 6,000 special needs assistants in the system. They will benefit the children in question and help them with their work.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to bureaucracy. This arises from the requirement that children undergo individual psychological assessments, which is precisely what we are trying to avoid. Teachers will be in place before a child even attends school so that as soon as a need is identified a child can be referred to the learning support teacher or resource teacher. This will reduce bureaucracy, form filling and cost for teachers and parents who under the current arrangement must have an individual assessment carried out.</P>
        <P>A further significant change has been the appointment of special education needs organisers, SENOs, who are already working with schools. In recent months parents have informed me that the SENOs are making a real difference by acting as a link between schools, parents and the other services. I am confident the Special Education Council will make even more progress in this respect. It will be part of its remit to evaluate progress, particularly in light of the allocations made for staffing, which are of major importance. All Deputies recognise that small class sizes are pointless unless linked to teaching methods.</P>
        <P>As our understanding advances and various programmes are developed, the area of special needs will have to be constantly evaluated. This will be a task of the Special Education Council and its conclusions will feed into our understanding.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the amount spent since 2000 on the provision and refurbishment of prefabricated buildings at primary and secondary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[7903/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the beginning of 2000 my Department has spent &euro;74,300,212 on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in the primary and post-primary sectors. This expenditure was for the supply and installation of the prefabricated buildings, including associated site works, and other costs such as for compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, connections for water, electricity and sewage.</P>
        <P>The breakdown of this expenditure ranges from approximately &euro;4.5 million in 2000, increasing to &euro;770,310 to date in 2005. The figure of &euro;74 million constitutes less than 5% of total expenditure on school buildings between 2000 and 2004. The total spent on primary and post-primary school buildings, including public private partnership projects at second level, is &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
        <P>Demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly in recent years, mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers, particularly in the area of special needs, <Col N="650"/>the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, in a permanent manner rather than relying on temporary accommodation. To reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level an initiative was launched in 2003, the purpose of which is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in the pilot was positive and the initiative was expanded to include 44 additional primary schools in 2004. More than 70 schools have been invited to participate in the initiative in 2005.</P>
        <P>My Department has also used other innovative solutions to deliver urgently required permanent accommodation for schools in rapidly developing areas. An example of this is the new 16 classroom primary school for Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school in Lucan, which was delivered through the use of a design and build contract within 13 months.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the initiative introduced in 2003 as a major step forward. I also accept that prefabricated buildings or temporary accommodation as the Minister and her predecessor prefer to call them are necessary in some instances. Does she accept, however, that &euro;74 million is a considerable amount to spend on buildings which, by their nature, are temporary and that this money could be put to better use?</P>
        <P>The initiative worked well in certain places but will not work in areas of major population growth where the scale of a project may be too large for a school to be able to complete it on its own. This type of process may not be appropriate for large developments. How does the Minister intend to deal with difficulties of this nature?</P>
        <P>The provision of prefabricated buildings is a short-term measure. For example, St. Corban&rsquo;s primary school in Naas welcomed the recent allocation of another prefabricated building because it is desperate. How many schools could have been built if we decided not to use this sticking plaster approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The priority must be to ensure there is space for the children. Prefabs are not a long-term solution. However, a school or an extra classroom cannot be built between now and September. This is why prefabs are provided in ensuring places for children.</P>
        <P>Another reason for so much temporary accommodation is the increase in the number of primary teachers from 22,095 in September 2000 to 25,959. With these extra teachers, including resource and learning support teachers, applications to the Department for extra space to accommodate them have risen.</P><Col N="651"/>
        <P>The Deputy referred to Naas as a developing area. Lucan, Ratoath and Kinnegad are also developing areas that have contributed to increased demand for temporary accommodation. There are also start-up schools awaiting building programmes. In the last four years, ten new gaelscoileanna and 16 Educate Together schools have been established. Many of them are in temporary accommodation awaiting new school buildings.</P>
        <P>Our main aim is to ensure children do not spend too long in temporary accommodation. Schemes such as the permanent initiative and giving schools the funds to build extra classrooms are working successfully. Securing sites for the provision of full schools will alleviate this in the future. Unfortunately, we will not be able to say there will never be prefabs because there must be place to accommodate children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Following from the reply to Question No. 51, will the Minister consider tabling an amendment to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to require developers to provide properly fitted school buildings, free of charge, in housing developments over a certain size? This would be similar to the strategic development zones such as Adamstown. Such an amendment would make an impact in the provision of school places. What progress has been made on multi-use modular school buildings? The needs of a growing primary school population could be extended into second level school provision in time while providing sports and community facilities at the same time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in examining development plans and looking at how school sites can be made available. It pains me to have to pay so much for some sites, particularly in the greater Dublin area. However, it must be acknowledged that many of the sites are private personal property. It is an issue that will arise in other Departments in the next several years. An individual&rsquo;s personal property cannot be taken from him or her for whatever use, as there are constitutional issues involved. I am looking for any process to alleviate the problems, particularly in the new growth areas.</P>
        <P>The idea of an education campus is positive, particularly with the sharing of sporting and community facilities. A whole culture of education can be created around an education campus, which can then be opened to adults. However, such a scheme is much easier for a new community to develop than an existing one. We are examining this system where lands are available.</P>

        <Quest>if her Department will alter a school bus route which no longer meets the needs of the children in the area (details supplied) in County Limerick.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Bus &Eacute;ireann, which administers the school transport scheme locally on behalf of the Department of Education and Science, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of school bus services. Routes are determined on the basis of numbers of eligible pupils in particular areas, road networks, distance guidelines and other operational factors.</P>
        <P>As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 2.4 km, 1.5 miles, to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a nationwide level would be prohibitive.</P>
        <P>The families residing in the areas referred to by the Deputy appear to be accommodated within the guidelines. It is not open to my Department to approve an extension of a service where it is satisfied that children have a level of service within the school transport guidelines and where the extension would involve additional cost. However, parents of eligible children may pay, subject to certain conditions, for a route extension themselves. Accordingly, should they so wish, they may consult with the local Bus &Eacute;ireann office regarding arrangements for a payable extension.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>While Deputy Neville&rsquo;s question refers to a specific school, how recently was the whole scheme reviewed? I accept that each child cannot be picked up outside his or her front door. However, do the Department&rsquo;s rules take into account the new growth areas and the changes that have occurred? Was a review carried out to ensure the provision of the best possible service in 2005, as distinct from 15 years ago when population centres were different and different needs had to be serviced?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>All these issues have been reviewed in recent years. While I am subject to correction on the date, I understand it was 2001 when a complete review was undertaken on distances and improvements on eligibility were made, allowing more people to avail of the service. The rules and regulations on distance have been made easier. The annual cost of providing school transport stands at &euro;100 million a year. Up to 140,000 pupils are looked after on a daily basis on over 5,000 routes. Approximately 8,000 pupils with special needs are also looked after by the scheme. The scheme is reviewed on an ongoing basis. There have been provisions in recent years to improve eligibility where distance is concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The rigidity of the system can often prevent the solution of certain problems. I am not sure of the school referred to by Deputy <Col N="653"/>Neville in his parliamentary question. However, recently, Deputy de Valera met with the principal of a school in County Limerick on a similar issue. If this is the school concerned, a free bus to it for children living in a certain area in Limerick which falls under the school&rsquo;s catchment area would solve their problem. Otherwise, their parents will have to transport them to the other side of Limerick city to receive schooling. All Members are aware of the problems with school places in Limerick city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Neville&rsquo;s parliamentary question was specific and he did not provide the details of the families involved. The Department understands three families are involved. One family resides 4 km, 2.5 miles, from Ballingarry national school and 0.64 km, less than half a mile, from the route of the existing service. The second family resides 3.8 km from the national school and under 0.5 km from the route of the existing service. Both families are being looked after under the scheme.</P>
        <P>In any discussion of the school transport scheme, the question of catchment areas arises. I am often asked why the catchment area system cannot be reviewed as it came into vogue in the late 1960s. Its main function is to prevent schools poaching pupils from one another. It was essentially designed to support the local school, particularly small rural schools where one could see their demise if poaching pupils was allowed. Catchment areas also impact on education policies such as building programmes and so forth. The rules and regulations have been improved greatly since the changes took place in 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will obviously be aware the catchment areas have not been reviewed since 1969. Will she undertake to carry out a simple review of the catchment areas and boundaries? Given the huge population shift that has taken place and the establishment of multi-denominational and Islamic schools and Gaelscoileanna, she might find they will have to be reviewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Sadly, there is nothing simple about the catchment areas debate, as I have pointed out. The question of catchment areas impacts on education policy throughout the Department. There would also have to be much discussion in regard to the building programme and so on. We have a very good service considering 140,000 students travel on a daily basis. There are 5,000 routes. The annual cost of the service is &euro;110 million, yet only &euro;6 million of that amount comes from charges parents or guardians must pay for the provision of that service. There is a particular provision to ensure children have an opportunity to avail of gaelscoileanna.</P>

        <Qid>56</Qid>
        <asker>Mr. Costello</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>her proposals to add <Col N="654"/>additional institutions to the list under the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[7957/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 enables additional institutions, in which children were placed and resident, and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule to the Act.</P>
        <P>Since enactment of the legislation, my Department has received correspondence from individual and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Accordingly, consultations have taken place between my Department and other Departments which may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities to ascertain the case for their inclusion under the Act.</P>
        <P>While inquiries have not yet been completed in respect of all institutions, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions to the Schedule. Further consultations are taking place in regard to a number of institutions and I will consider the position of these institutions when this process has been completed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Deputy Costello, who tabled this question, had a particular concern about Bethany Home in respect of which he received correspondence. Will the Minister indicate whether it is one of the institutions being considered? It would not have been under the auspices of any of the bodies which signed the indemnity agreement. Will the Minister clarify whether the fact that it was not run by one of these bodies would rule it out?</P>
        <P>In regard to the recent High Court judgment which awarded a considerable sum to somebody who survived residential institutional abuse, does the Minister intend to amend the Act?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Institutions included on the list must be identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children&rsquo;s homes and special schools in which children are placed and resident. A key feature is that a public body had to have a regulatory or inspection function. In many cases, we are still trying to identify whether the State or a public body had a regulatory function and, therefore, our liability in that regard. That might delay the inclusion of some of the institutions.</P>
        <P>On the case last week, I do not believe it is necessary to amend the legislation. I think everybody will agree the system works very well. There are distinct advantages to the redress scheme and the way it works. It is practical and people are able to get financial redress for what they have suffered. It is very fast and there is a much lower burden of proof. It is not an adversarial process. Many people have had offers made to them on the basis of an application and without ever hav<Col N="655"/>ing their cases heard. Many people have accepted that on the basis that it is private.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that of all the awards made by the redress board only four have been rejected. The number of awards of over &euro;200,000 made by the redress board or the review committee that have not been accepted is nil. It is working very sensitively and efficiently and that is what is important to the victims.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P><Col N="656"/>
    <P LI="2">1.&mdash;The Ombudsman shall include in her annual report a special report on the overpayment of tax by PAYE taxpayers, and on the take up of credits by such taxpayers, and the branch of her office dedicated to ensuring that the take up of credits is readily available to all taxpayers, and refunds made as rapidly as possible where this arises, shall be known as the Taxpayers&rsquo; Advocate Office.</P>
    <P Just="Right" el="0">&mdash;(Deputy Burton).<?oasys _is0p10-?></P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined the role the Revenue Commissioners play in ensuring as much information as possible is available to ordinary taxpayers and I recapped a number of points, some of which were made in detail on Committee Stage. The only reliable figures available on the amount of tax overpaid by PAYE taxpayers are the amounts repaid as a consequence of claims by taxpayers resulting in a review of their liabilities. It is not possible or reasonable to extrapolate from these an estimate of unclaimed overpayments by the PAYE population because claims or requests for review are, by definition, much more likely to come from those who know they have an entitlement to a relief, such as medical expenses, for which they have not claimed. There would be no basis for assuming that a similar proper proportion of all PAYE taxpayers have entitlements to repayment.</P>
      <P>Drawing on that and from service providers and others outside Revenue would not improve Revenue&rsquo;s ability to measure the extent to which there are unclaimed overpayments by PAYE taxpayers. In general, Revenue cannot be aware of an overpayment in a particular case unless information vouching the overpayment is provided to it by the taxpayer. Consulting data from outside Revenue will not, of itself, stimulate taxpayers to claim what would otherwise be unclaimed entitlements.</P>
      <P>There are cases where the number of claimants for tax relief based on expenditure incurred should be less than the total numbers incurring such costs. This would arise where potential claimants do not exceed the minimum thresholds for admissible claims, such as medical expenses, or are not able to avail of the tax reliefs due to insufficient income, for example.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, therefore, I cannot accept the amendments principally because there is no reason to believe either would assist, to any great extent, in identifying taxpayers who have not claimed their full entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>On the day the Travers report has been published, highlighting and justifying the work of the Ombudsman in vindicating the rights of citizens in respect of nursing home charges, it is ironic that the Minster for Finance will not accept a modest amendment which proposes that the Ombudsman be given the power, authority and duty to produce a report, in the role of taxpayers&rsquo; advocate, on the problem of people who overpay tax and who fail to get a prompt refund of tax overpaid.</P><Col N="657"/>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said regarding Revenue seeking to improve the situation. However, that is not the entire point. As with the Travers report, this is also about accountability. When will there be a responsibility not merely to seek to do the minimum but to seek to do the maximum? We have a very narrow tax base of which PAYE taxpayers contribute the vast bulk of tax. This is a small measure to ensure their rights are promptly asserted by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>There is no Minister in charge of the Revenue Commissioners. While Government policy guides and dictates their actions, they are largely independent of the Minister for Finance. There is not even a MAC meeting at which a Minister could obtain a briefing on how matters are progressing. There is no external accountability by the Revenue Commissioners except by teasing out matters through the process of continuously asking parliamentary questions. It is a painfully slow process, particularly since the Government has all but closed down the possibility of obtaining information under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>I again commend the amendment to the Minister. I am surprised the Minister is not prepared to break from the former Minister&rsquo;s style and, for once, act on behalf of the compliant PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>It is evident the Minister does not intend to accept Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment or mine when I move it later. On Committee Stage he suggested that he would examine the mechanism by which taxpayers are informed of their entitlements, tax credits and so on. Perhaps he would ask the Revenue Commissioners to examine this area with a view to enabling people to easily understand their entitlements and assess their potential liability and be thus more likely to review the amount of tax they are paying and hence seek the refunds we are talking about. Will the Minister reaffirm his commitment to ask some section of Revenue to do that? It would be a step in the right direction, given that he is not prepared to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners, who have been in attendance here on Committee Stage and on Report Stage, will be able to report on the level of debate this issue has generated. I am sure they will continue, as they have done proactively up to now, to seek in whatever way they can and at every opportunity to bring to taxpayers&rsquo; attention the relevant information, recognising that it is the primary responsibility of taxpayers in the first instance. The Revenue Commissioners are not responsible for ensuring that every taxpayer&rsquo;s liability is calculated as it should be. Obviously they want it to be that way and they require taxpayers to do that.</P>
      <P>In today&rsquo;s newspapers there are further major advertisements by the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="658"/>referring to information at taxpayers&rsquo; fingertips, suggesting texting as a new way to contact Revenue, indicating the information leaflets that are available on tax reliefs on the payment of third level tuition fees, tax credit details, claims for medical expenses. They are seeking, through this sort of marketing, to encourage and ensure to the greatest extent that taxpayers recognise they can contact Revenue and that the Revenue Commissioners are amenable, open and anxious to assist in every way they can to ensure that those who are anxious to comply with their obligations have every assistance and expertise that is obtainable from the Revenue to help them do that. That is in their interests, taxpayers&rsquo; interests and our interests.</P>
      <P>To the extent that a continuing review takes place to see what other ideas might be to hand to help them do that, the Revenue have indicated by their proactive work so far that they are confident of the culture they are promoting and seeking to inculcate as part of our tax culture and tax system. Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s earlier assertions on amendment No. 58, I assure her there is no dilution and no change. It strengthens the provision, and the usual conspiracy theory is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has at last opened his mouth on the issue because his silence was very telling. Only time will tell when we have had an opportunity to analyse it. According to the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; figures there were overpayments of tax by PAYE taxpayers of &euro;306 million in 2003, &euro;267 million in 2002 and &euro;193 million in 2001. It is estimated that approximately &euro;170 million is still outstanding. In terms of the billions of euro in taxpayers&rsquo; money with which the Minister has become used to dealing and that must be used for repayments of charges and so on, &euro;300 million might seem trivial, but it is important to the people who have overpaid tax. I cannot see why the Minister cannot accept the notion of accountability by the Revenue by their efforts in this area being the subject of a regular report by the Ombudsman. Since the Government closed down on freedom of information it has been difficult to get any information about what happens in this Government. That was a significant loss of function by the Ombudsman. There is, therefore, plenty of scope for the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office to do an important public duty regarding accountability.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The Minister is very confident that every taxpayer is completely proficient in using the various mechanisms of the Revenue&rsquo;s public information system and that every taxpayer is fully on top of the process of claiming his or her due entitlements. As the Minister has such long experience as a Deputy, it surprises me that that should be his experience. Anybody who has had the honour of serving as a Deputy knows only too well how confused people are and how afraid they are, often<?oasys _jy?><Col N="659"/><?oasys _fc?>unnecessarily. If they had another office, such as a taxpayers&rsquo; advocate, that they could use to assert their rights, there would be an improvement in accountability and, in particular, a better <Col N="660"/>deal for taxpayers who are currently overpaying tax to the tune of &euro;300 million or more every year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 arises out of Committee Stage. Amendment No. 10 is <Col N="661"/>related and the two amendments may be taken together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">1.&mdash;The tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits relating to income tax set out in the Finance Act 2004 are hereby increased by such rate as would maintain the real value of those bands, limits and credits in terms of changes in the cost of living since 2003.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to restore to taxpayers the stealth taxes exacted on them in a highly secretive fashion by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, in the budgets of 2003 and 2004. His failure to offer compensation for the increase in prices and his freezing of the tax bands and credits resulted in perhaps the single greatest stealth tax in the history of the State. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will argue that he made some attempt in this year&rsquo;s budget to compensate for increases in the course of 2004. However, taxpayers were ripped off to an incredible extent by the former Minister in his last two budgets, for 2003 and 2004.</P>
      <P>In regard to tax credits, we must move towards a system in which the taxpayer is compensated for changes in the value of money. The failure of the former Minister to do so in two successive years resulted in a massive additional windfall in tax revenues collected by the State, much of which was not well spent. We recall the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, blowing &euro;60 million of it on the electronic voting system, and the substantial sum doled out to the former Minister for Finance&rsquo;s favourite object in Punchestown. All this was paid for by taxpayers, particularly PAYE workers whose wage packets were dipped into by Mr. McCreevy at an ever-increasing rate.</P>
      <P>This year, as in the last two years, the majority of PAYE workers will pay tax at the top rate. A single person earning slightly more than the average industrial wage, approximately &euro;31,000, will pay tax on overtime or other additional payments at a rate of 42%. We are all familiar with the credo of the Government in regard to low taxes. The Government believes in low tax rates of 20% for capital gains tax, low rates of 20% for inheritance tax and effectively no tax for a number of millionaires who choose to invest in the plethora of tax avoidance schemes which were created consciously by the former Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>However, a single person earning &euro;31,000 per annum does not get the benefit of any of this. If such taxpayers receive a wage increase as part of a national wage agreement, do overtime or get bonuses, they are likely to find that incremental income taxed at the rate of 42%. When one includes social contributions, the average single taxpayer earning more than &euro;31,000 is subject to a total take of approximately 50%. That is not a low marginal rate. Moreover, those on this level <Col N="662"/>of taxation, unlike their counterparts in many European social democracies where those who pay that level of tax enjoy superior levels of entitlement, particularly to health and other social services, are likely to have relatively few entitlements if they exceed a certain income level.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that the income limit for parents seeking a third level grant for their children, except perhaps for those in the farming business, is so low that most PAYE workers, including those who have retired early and whose partners have a part-time job, do not qualify. Similarly, the income limits for medical cards are very low. Admittedly, the Minister introduced in the budget a new form of yellow pack medical card which provides an entitlement to free GP visits. Again, however, the Minister should check the income limit for this provision against the average industrial wage. He should check it against the circumstances of a family where one partner is working full-time, the other works 20 hours a week and they have a child suffering from asthma. That family does not get a fair deal, but pays a considerable amount of income tax on the nail. This cuts to the heart of the type of tax system that Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs has created. Taxpayers in the PAYE net pay a considerable amount of income tax but they have a relatively restricted entitlement to services, particularly in the health area. Therefore, if they earn anywhere in the region of the average industry wage or upwards, they also pay high levels of health insurance coverage. Their position can be contrasted to that of the golden circle that surrounds the Government which invests in property-based tax breaks. When the Revenue Commissioners carried out a survey two years ago they found that 400 of the top earners between them availed of &euro;78 million in tax breaks, the bulk of them arising from property-based tax breaks. As well as intensive advertising of a low marginal rate for corporation tax which Deputy Quinn of the Labour Party introduced when he was Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister likes to have history only according to Fianna F&aacute;il. He has sold the message of low marginal rates of tax, but the bulk of PAYE taxpayers pay high marginal rates of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The rate of corporation tax was 38% in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s officials will tell him that low rate was signed off by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union in 1996. I am sure the Minister&rsquo;s officials can probably provide him with a note of those proceedings and agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Deputy the facts on that tomorrow. That is another bit of her propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>At that stage there was a zero manufacturing tax rate for most companies involved in manufacturing and the rate was reduced to a joint common rate as a consequence of EU changes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to introduce some fairness and equity for the ordinary man and women who work day in day out, live in the commuter belt around Dublin, pay one mortgage, pay the equivalent of another mortgage if they have one or two children in child care and who were fleeced by then Minister, Deputy McCreevy in 2003 and 2004. The Minister has chosen in all the Fianna F&aacute;il budgets to defend the very well off. There was small change in that respect on his taking office. He was put there to signal a change. If he wanted to do that, he would introduce some equity into the system for PAYE taxpayers compared to the tax breaks he showers on the people who crowd the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway Races every year.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to go into the history of corporation tax, he will know that there was a zero manufacturing rate for a period and under EU rules we had to bring that into one rate, and that was signed off by Deputy Quinn during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency when the Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and Democratic Left coalition was in power. That is the position in case the Minister is reaching for papers to check it.</P>

	<P>I hope so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The thinking behind the amendment proposed by Deputy Burton is that many rich people on huge incomes are paying a very low rate of tax. It emerged that there were ten millionaires who were paying no tax. This gave rise to anger among the ordinary PAYE taxpayers who feel they are being crucified by the level of tax they have to pay. They go on to the top rate of tax at a low income &mdash;&euro;29,400 this year &mdash; and on every euro they earn above that they must pay tax at the 42% rate and on top of that their PRSI contribution. They feel aggrieved that people with huge incomes ranging from &euro;500,000 to &euro;1 million a year should not pay any tax. The amendment proposes a minimum rate of tax which people should be required to pay.</P>
      <P>The Minister is examining the various tax shelters and tax breaks available and will report to us on what exactly they are in the next few months. There is a reasonable case to be made for having a base rate of tax which everybody should be required to pay. If a person has an income of &euro;1 million per annum and because of various tax breaks, write-offs so on, the person has a nil liability for tax, what is the position regarding that person&rsquo;s children qualifying for higher education grants? Will that person receive a certificate to the effect that because he or she has a nil tax rating his or her income is deemed to be at a rate whereby the person&rsquo;s children would qualify for higher education grants? If that were the case, what is the Minister&rsquo;s comment on it? Furthermore, if that were the case, how can he compare that person&rsquo;s circumstances to those of a taxi driver in Mullingar, Tara or Tullamore who works long hours to make a living and who leases the taxi rather than purchasing it, given that the amount of the lease is taken out of his financial returns and added in for income purposes to assess him for qualification for higher education grants for his children? Would it not be a terrible scandal if those high rollers, who have a nil liability for tax, qualified for higher education grants for their children, while the ordinary working person who is working long hours to earn an income would have such a lease amount added in for income purposes?</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the irony that there are different ways of assessing people&rsquo;s income in different Departments. In the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, if I was a taxi man and submitted my returns, for tax purposes I could deduct the cost of leasing my car as a legitimate expense in compiling my net income. However, if I produced the same returns and submitted them into the local authority to process them for grant purposes for a higher education grant, the local authority on the instructions of the Department of Education and Science would advise that it does not agree with what the Department of Finance has advised. It would advise that amount is not really my income and that I must add the money I pay <Col N="665"/>for the lease of the vehicle. It is unreasonable that people should be treated in that way. There must be a uniform approach across all Departments in dealing with people&rsquo;s income. Perhaps the Minister, who is new to his Department, will examine this matter with a view to getting his Cabinet colleagues to agree to a uniform approach.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 proposes that everybody should pay a base rate of tax. In other words, one should pay a certain percentage of one&rsquo;s income as tax, regardless of how well-off one is. It will not be easy to introduce such a rate. With all due respect to Deputy Burton, it is not possible to include a measure of this nature in a Finance Bill just like that. The amendment proposes that the Minister should prepare a report on how such a system can best be introduced. In fairness, there is a case to be made for this approach. It is a scandal that somebody who earns &euro;1 million per annum does not pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 10 deal specifically with the possibility of index-linking tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits. I will discuss the amendments before considering some of the other issues that have been raised during the debate. Amendment No. 3 proposes to correct the imbalance that has arisen from recent budgets. I approve more of amendment No. 10, which goes further by seeking to include the principle of index-linking in all future budgets. I was disappointed that the Minister did not accept this principle on Committee Stage. He would do well to examine how the principle exists satisfactorily in the budgetary regimes of other countries. Individual taxpayers should know, as a matter of fairness, that the value of the money they give to the State in a given year will not change much as a result of outside factors, such as inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably repeat the figures he cited on Second and Committee Stages to suggest that the amount of money workers have in their pockets is greater than it was in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a killer argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not really.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy does not like it when I use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister makes that argument, he forgets to index-link the 1997 money. The figure of &euro;11,000, which he regularly quotes in the House, is nothing like &euro;11,000 in 1997 figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite the Deputy to cite the figure he thinks is correct. He can deduct a certain amount from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>When we are making deductions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it 3%?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="666"/>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;not only should we index-link the value of the money in inflationary terms, but we should also consider the additional moneys people are paying in other types of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Bruton said that the relevant deduction is &euro;2,000 per household. I do not accept that figure, but even if I allow Deputy Boyle to deduct a further &euro;1,000, the relevant figure will be &euro;8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We should engage in a proper exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to engage in a more honest exercise to determine the actual figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not doubt that there has been an increase, but it is clear when one takes into account the two factors I have mentioned that it has not been anything like &euro;11,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the figure in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not need to have this argument in the future if the Minister accepts the principle of the amendments before the House. Index-linking should be accepted as a matter of course. It should be a policy priority when the Minister is compiling next year&rsquo;s budget and any subsequent budgets he might have the joy of bringing to the House. It should not be possible to play around with figures to argue that additional taxation is being paid to the Exchequer solely because of inflationary factors. The Minister should accept this principle to be fair to taxpayers. If he is not prepared to accept it now, I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming that he will give serious consideration to it when future budgets and finance Bills are brought before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not favour the introduction of a minimum tax rate as a means of addressing the problem of the legitimate evasion of tax by people on high incomes. While such a tax rate would ensure that people could not have a 0% liability, it would also mean that most taxpayers who have the income to do so would aim for the new minimum rate at every possible opportunity. The introduction of maximum tax relief, on individual reliefs and as a total of all tax reliefs, would be a better option. The Minister has decided to modify some tax <Col N="667"/>reliefs in this Bill, in advance of the report on such reliefs he will receive later this year. It is a pity he has not adopted the principle I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>We need to try to stop widespread tax avoidance. Rules need to be put in place to make it clear to people that if they invest a certain amount of money in certain areas, the benefit they will receive will be strictly limited. They will not be able to avoid the entire tax liability that, as citizens of this country, they should contribute to the Exchequer. This is 2005 &mdash; we should not allow people on high incomes to avoid paying any tax in 2006. Having listened to the Minister on Second and Committee Stages, I do not expect him to change his mind. However, I ask him to put down a marker to indicate that he will be favourably disposed to accepting this principle when we address this issue again. We should not have to discuss this matter during debates on future finance Bills.</P>

	<P>I support amendment No. 3, in the name of Deputy Burton, and amendment No. 10, in the name of Deputy Paul McGrath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>What happened to amendment No. 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a credible argument for the premise that the adjustment of band limits and credits should be index-linked. The inflationary effect on the take-home pay of ordinary families and workers was not adequately taken into account in the past when budgetary changes were made in times of high inflation. I appreciate that inflation rates are low at present, but there is a need to protect the interests of workers in times of high inflation. Critical aspects of taxation, such as tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits, which are mentioned in amendment No. 3, should provide a basic level of protection.</P>
      <P>Index-linking is critically important because it allows for a real evaluation of the changes, effects and impacts of the Minister&rsquo;s proposals. There is a huge fudge at present because they are not index-linked. There needs to be an assessment of the real value, if there is value, or inadequacy of the proposals. They may be inadequate if the proposed changes do not keep pace with the rate of inflation, which has been the case in the past. There is a need for protection. This sane proposition merits support and I hope the Minister will respond more favourably to it than he did on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced in his Budget Statement that he would initiate a review of tax incentives, reliefs and exemptions, particularly property-based tax breaks. Would it not be appropriate at this stage to commence a compre<Col N="668"/>hensive review of the entire tax code? Several amendments have made the case for such a review. If the Minister does not agree with the basic premise of amendments Nos. 3 and 10, he might agree nonetheless that such a review would offer an opportunity to conduct a proper evaluation of the impact of the tax code in all cases. A comprehensive review is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>ICTU, for example, made a very serious charge against our tax system in its report of last October. The report states the system is fundamentally unjust, biased against those on low and middle incomes and does not raise enough tax overall to pay for modern public services. I regard the proposition on indexing as a key and important element in an overall review, to which I hope the Minister will commit in the course of this Bill&rsquo;s passage through this House. It is imperative that he does not park his interest in respect of the heretofore unknown social and economic effects and benefits that might accrue to the economy from the property-based tax reliefs. The ministerial review is not enough although it will certainly help us to come to an informed opinion as to their value.</P>
      <P>I understand that neither the Department of Finance nor the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is able to tell us exactly the cost the reliefs in question represent to the Exchequer. It is a major failing on the part of the system to make provision for particular tax breaks without their even having been costed in terms of their real financial impact or effect in terms of social and economic measurements.</P>
      <P>If it is the Minister&rsquo;s intent to oppose these amendments, I hope he will use Report Stage of this Bill to indicate his intention to set in train a full and comprehensive review that will take on board the very salient arguments the Opposition Deputies have presented this afternoon and on Committee Stage regarding index linking. The latter represents an important measure and improvement, most especially in the interest of the least well off and the least remunerated in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 10 essentially propose indexation. It would appear that Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment aims to increase the tax bands, exemption limits and tax credits by the projected increase in the consumer price index for 2005 over 2003, that is, by an estimated<?oasys _jy?>4.75%. It seems that Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment proposes that certain tax credits should be index-linked to inflation automatically each year before and in addition to any further personal tax changes that might be made in the annual budget.</P>
      <P>The estimated full-year cost of the measure proposed by Deputy Burton is &euro;460 million. On Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment, if we take the figure of 2.5%, representing the growth in the consumer price index for September 2004 over September 2003, we will note that the full-year cost of indexing the personal tax credits referred <Col N="669"/>to in his amendment would be approximately &euro;75 million in a full year and approximately &euro;54 million in 2005.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, the Government could not accept an approach that seeks to impose indexation across a range of personal credits or across credits, bands and exemption limits as it could curtail the scope to target available resources at those areas where the greatest priority for attention has been identified. It is a prerogative of Government to focus on these areas. In budget 2005, this was achieved through the removal from the tax net of those earning the national minimum wage.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment specifically, the Government could not accept an approach involving a kind of mandatory ear-marked tax expenditure that could limit the flexibility of any Government, including this one, in determining budgetary priorities, having regard to economic realities in any given year. I do not believe any Minister for Finance would wish to be so constrained.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment, the actual percentage increases provided for in the budget&rsquo;s personal tax package were considerably more than indexation would have provided for in many instances. For example, the employee tax credit increased by 22% and the health levy threshold was increased by more than 12% for those on gross incomes of less than &euro;400 per week. The age exemption limits were increased by 6.5%. The incapacitated child tax credit was doubled in value, the blind person&rsquo;s tax credit was increased by one quarter and the widowed person&rsquo;s tax credit was increased by one third.</P>
      <P>Available resources in budget 2005 were employed primarily with the lower-paid and the elderly in mind. Accordingly, the basic personal credit and the employee credit, that is, the PAYE credit, were increased to fully exempt the current minimum wage from taxation. The age exemption limits for those aged 65 and over increased for the fourth year in a row. To the extent that money was available for other measures, it was used to widen the standard rate band, thereby exempting certain income earners from paying tax at the top rate.</P>
      <P>Rather than adopting a mechanical approach involving index linking, as suggested, it is better to adopt a far more flexible approach characterised by its focus on the less well-off. One could use whatever model one liked and be open to making whatever decisions one wanted to make, but one should note that the approach we took had the necessary focus. While one would always like to do more, one works within certain budgetary parameters. Were we to accept Deputy Burton&rsquo;s proposal, some &euro;460 million would be deducted from the tax package straight away and one would not be able to focus, by way of providing extra reliefs, on the lower-paid to improve their circumstances.</P>
      <P>All taxpayers have benefited over the past eight budgets and there have been significant <Col N="670"/>reductions in average tax rates right across the board. For example, the most recent data available from the OECD show that in 2003, for a single person on the average production wage, Ireland had the lowest tax wedge in the European Union and one of the lowest among members of the OECD. For the average production worker who is married with two children with a carer in the home, Ireland now has the lowest tax wedge of all members of the OECD. The OECD data show that the tax wedge for such workers has fallen more sharply in Ireland than in any other OECD country, reflecting the progress made in this area.</P>
      <P>The approach in budget 2005 is fully in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government to deliver further real improvements to pensioners and people on low incomes and to achieve, over the next five years, a position in which all those on the national minimum wage can be removed from the tax net. As I stated on Committee Stage, the Government is committed to sustaining growth, strengthening and maintaining the competitive position of the economy and maintaining full employment. Responsible and targeted fiscal policies are central to the achievement of these aims. The proposal outlined by the Deputies would be somewhat inconsistent with that approach and therefore I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>On Members&rsquo; comments on previous budgets, my predecessor was not able to do what people would have liked because of an international economic downturn. He has been criticised for it, yet Ireland emerged from that downturn better than anywhere else. In the 2001 budget, there was a very large increase, to &euro;28,000, in the standard rate band for a single person.</P>
      <P>Of course tax reliefs provide benefits to those who avail of them. This is why so many avail of mortgage interest relief, for example. That so many in our society want to own their own homes has led to the provision of this relief. The vast majority of the reliefs are directed towards ordinary people. They include housing, medical and medical insurance reliefs, for example, which we associate with normal tax relief systems and provisions. Some people paid no tax under a Labour Minister for Finance &mdash; there is a survey to that effect. This is not a result of new policies introduced by my predecessor, as was suggested. This has been a function of the tax system for some time. I made it clear in my first budget speech that those using this group of reliefs should realise that the concept of unlimited or unrestricted reliefs is no longer viable or acceptable to the tax-paying public in the present economic circumstances. I want to ensure that everyone contributes appropriately to the State.</P>
      <P>I am not complacent about that and I want to review it comprehensively. People might take the view that I should consider this or that, and I want to take a holistic view. I have made the point, which others say they acknowledge but sometimes omit from their arguments, that when <Col N="671"/>people avail of tax reliefs it provides for those who have a higher disposable income than others, in many instances. One must find the balance between the benefit such reliefs provide to the individual taxpayer and the benefit to the wider community of the increased economic activity provided by those incentivised reliefs. No one disputes that there are many instances of economic activity in certain parts of the country which would not have that rate of development without those incentives.</P>
      <P>It is timely, given the present rate of economic and social development, that we should review all that and see where we can change, apart from property or area-based reliefs. This review must consider that more people are at work than ever before, we have more buoyant revenues, the cost of providing services increases year on year, apart from further service development, we have a major infrastructural modernisation programme and a large public capital programme.</P>
      <P>I was at a long ECOFIN meeting this week at which the Stability and Growth Pact was reviewed. Some of the countries represented are in a far tighter financial position than we are. One Minister talked about his country&rsquo;s capital programme growing to 2.25% of GDP. Ours was 4.7% last year and we hope to get it to 5%, which is double the EU average. We remain in one of the best positions regarding the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
      <P>That is a digression. Even against that positive background we cannot provide everything from public funds. There will always be a role for private capital, and we must ensure we direct that capital to the areas of activity from which we will derive a communal benefit. No one in the House has ever opposed tax reliefs in principle because to do so would put oneself off-side with the majority who avail of these reliefs. Ordinary workers and taxpayers avail of relief on mortgage interest, VHI contributions and so on.</P>
      <P>We need an informed and balanced debate. The purpose of the review is to ensure greater equity in the system and to explain the benefits derived from reliefs. It may be good political rhetoric and feed the sense of controversy to say the Government protects its friends. References to the golden circle and that sort of nonsense may be eye-catching and generate a few lines in the newspapers, but I do not know who these people are. I am a public representative who, like every other Member, wants to ensure we reward risk and that all our people get jobs at home commensurate with their abilities, that we can redress our infrastructural deficit, deal with these issues and provide more money for public services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton suggested we are committed to low taxes as if that is a bad thing. I am in favour of low tax for the simple reason that it brings in more money for the State. I am a pragmatist. The more people at work, the higher the contribution to the State. It was suggested that it was bad to cut capital gains tax to 20%. Deputy Burton <Col N="672"/>should look at the figures: in 1997 it yielded &euro;158 million and last year it was in the region of &euro;1,500 million. If the Deputy is committed to developing public services, as we all are, to develop our health service, roads system and local authority and public housing, why is she so excited when capital gains tax goes up by a factor of ten? Will she say she does not agree and that it should be up to 50% or 70%, to give the impression that if it was brought that high one would have three times more than the &euro;1,500 million? We all know that would not be the case. Let us stop fooling ourselves with this nonsense and deal with the issues.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has a point on the penalisation of workers. I do not claim to be the winner on every front, but it is on a sticky wicket on this issue. The best way to measure the impact of the tax and PRSI systems over years is to calculate deductions as a percentage of a constant real income. That is an income which has just kept pace with inflation. One arrives at this by taking what a person earned in 1995, adding inflation to see what that person earns now and seeing what percentage of his or her income was paid on tax and PRSI then and now. That is a good way to indicate whether the burden has become lighter or heavier.</P>
      <P>For example, if a single person, taxed under the PAYE system and on the higher rate of PRSI, earning £30,000 in 1995-96, which is equivalent to &euro;38,092, received pay rises in line with inflation, he or she would earn approximately &euro;50,193 in this tax year. The deductions as a percentage of income would have adjusted over time as a result of the budget changes. In 1995, on that salary, the person paid, under PAYE and the higher rate of PRSI, 42.12% in tax before this Administration came into office. In 2005 the same person, on the equivalent salary, increased in line with inflation only, would earn &euro;50,193 and pay 28.49% on PAYE and the higher rate of PRSI. That is a fact.</P>
      <P>A person earning £100,000 in 1995 would have paid 47.8% and now pays 39.45% on the equivalent earnings. If a person earned £12,000 in 1995, which is equivalent to &euro;15,237, he or she paid 25.82% in PAYE and higher rate of PRSI. Allowing for inflation, that person would earn &euro;20,077 today, and pay &euro;8.49% on a low wage. Quite rightly, that person pays a low tax but the same person paid a quarter of his or her income ten years ago. Someone earning £20,000 in 1995-96 paid 37.43% in tax. In today&rsquo;s terms that person would earn &euro;33,462 and the percentage of PAYE and higher rate PRSI would be 19.37%.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>These examples are for people on less than average incomes, less than the minimum wage, average incomes and above. People will feel confident that there is a genuine attempt to bring equity to the tax system, even though they may argue whether it is sufficiently equitable. The progression is consistent with an equitable sharing of the tax burden. The fact that there are 640,000 more people in the tax system is one of the reasons this is the <Col N="673"/>case. This involves promoting an enterprise system that rewards risk.</P>
      <P>We must be careful to maintain a balance. By examining how things operate in isolation from how they interact in the wider economic system, despite our genuine belief to the contrary, we must not end up in a situation where we slow the rate of economic activity which, in turn, will deprive us of the number of people active in the labour force who are generating wealth and making a contribution to the tax system. That is always a balancing act, not a scientific certainty. In the short time Deputy Burton has been finance spokesperson, she has held different views from me on what the correct model should be. I do not mind discussing the various models, but let us not subscribe to the idea that some of us have each taxpayer&rsquo;s interest at heart while others are only interested in 400 or 2,000 income tax earners. I also live in the community and I am proud to represent people of all income levels.</P>
      <P>We need to inform ourselves as to the nature of the model, how it is working and how it might be improved. I am not saying that what the Deputy said is wrong. From the point of view of the budgetary parameters within which the Government must work and discharge its responsibility, these are the explanations I am providing. Under any objective analysis, they signify real improvements in terms of lightening the burden on ordinary workers.</P>
      <P>Looking at the 2004 Estimates, the top 2% of people account for 28% of taxes paid, the top 4% account for 42%, the top 8% account for 55% and the top 13% account for 66%. In other words, almost 80% of tax is accounted for by the top 22% of people. The Deputy asked about the impact on student grants and so on. One of the problems in this regard is the decision made by the Labour Party in government when, in an attempt to hold the middle class vote it got in the 1992 election, it abolished fees regardless of income. I do not know what the social progression of this was. Once a decision is taken, it is very difficult to reverse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister took part in the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>If I did, I plead guilty. If the former Minister, Niamh Breathnach, was the Minister, perhaps I took part in the decision. Even if I did not agree with the decision, it is fair to say that I was collectively responsible for it. While there may have been some political motive for the decision, it was not socially progressive in terms of what I have done. My decision is socially progressive. It will restore enterprise, reward risk, change the nature of the poverty trap and so on. Whatever people say about my predecessor &mdash; some very unfair things have been said; I suppose they will always be said about him &mdash; he brought about that sort of change, and if people do not like aspects of it, that is their business. One cannot expect people to be unanimously in favour <Col N="674"/>of decisions. We would have a very boring country if everyone was in favour of everything.</P>
      <P>Genuine improvements have taken place. There are more people at work and there is more economic activity. We now have an opportunity to examine these aspects, see where the balance lies and perhaps identify other areas of activity where tax relief schemes might play a role based on the priorities we identify in the community. That has been and will continue to be my approach. It is as transparent and comprehensive as I can make it. It is not correct to say that the bulk of taxpayers will pay tax at the top rate. In the wake of the move to tax credits, it is more correct to talk about income earners than taxpayers. Following budget 2005, 33.2% of earners will pay tax at the higher rate compared with 35.9% if there were no changes in the budget. We would like to do more, which will be a major challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Indexation would guarantee that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it would not guarantee that. If I accepted Deputy Burton&rsquo;s amendment, it would take 460,000 out of the tax bracket right across the board at all levels of income. One has a choice, and I will stand over my choices which I believe met with a fair degree of approval. I was very gratified with the level of approval they received. We may argue about them here today and people may vote for and against them, but I am explaining the thinking behind what I am doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be interesting to extend the statistical exercise, with which the Minister&rsquo;s officials supplied him, to include the incidence of indirect taxation in the period of statistical analysis to which he referred. He said that he attends EU ECOFIN meetings. I am sure his officials are aware that when one takes the more complete picture, when one includes the impact of indirect taxation on lower and average income earners, because this country&rsquo;s VAT rates are in the higher bracket, work carried out by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions indicates that the incidence of taxation borne by families on average incomes is much higher.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged indirectly in his contribution the second point I will make. The Government has had a policy of replacing taxation by charges wherever possible. This means that the family about whom he spoke could now expect to pay in many counties &euro;500 or more a year for refuse charges. If they need a hospital bed, they will pay significantly more than they paid in 1997. If they take out VHI or other forms of private health insurance, they will pay many multiples of what they paid in 1997. An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently increased the fee for observations in regard to planning from &euro;20 to &euro;50. These are the types of increases the Government <Col N="675"/>imposes on ordinary families throughout the country on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>In regard to high income earners, the Minister will be aware that many of these units of taxation, which are referred to as high income earners, are couples. Unfortunately, the statistical information is not desegregated to take account of each earner as opposed to the unit as a couple. According to the Minister&rsquo;s statistics, the couple beloved of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a garda married to a nurse, is regarded as high income earners because their income in Revenue&rsquo;s statistics are bundled together as one unit.</P>
      <P>Taking into account taxation, VAT and the huge range of extra charges they pay at every point, they have been robbed blind by the Government. The Government has sold it well, particularly when they are compared to those who can convert their income. The Minister acknowledged in an amendment that it was possible under his predecessor for people to convert earned income into capital gains and hence to go from the marginal 42% tax rate to the much lower rate of 20%. The purpose of the Labour Party amendment is to seek equity for that section of the population that we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said in his response to these amendments that it is a question of the issues. Is the real issue not that his predecessor froze the level of personal tax credit and PAYE allowance and, as a result, pushed people with their normal increases who were near &euro;28,000 in earnings into the top rate of tax? They pay the surplus at 42% and, hence, there has been an increase in the number paying tax at the top rate. If that had been index linked, with wage increases running slightly ahead of inflation, they would not pay tax at the top rate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has increased the 20% threshold by &euro;1,400. That is welcome and keeps pace with inflation for this year, but for two or three years it did not happen. The write-off for the taxpayer should at least keep pace with inflation in terms of allowances and tax credits. It should not be the case that for any increase people get in their wages or the overtime they do they pay tax at the top rate. Those affected are at the margins of living reasonably well. If someone earning &euro;28,000 can get some overtime and is charged 42%, it lessens the incentive to do that overtime. If he was, however, below the threshold and indexation was in place, it would keep him within those limits and make it more attractive.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that in the long term, with the low taxation he is talking about, there will be greater incentive for people to earn more and give the Exchequer more. We should move towards a system of indexation where people know from year to year that their credits will be increased.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government&rsquo;s tax cuts between 1997 and 2002 saw only 5% of budget tax cut benefits going to the bottom 20% of earners. That is a fact. We are living with the legacy of the failure on the part of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor to address properly the needs of the low paid and the least well-off in our society. All that the Minister can hope to do with what he has presented in his first budget is commence a process of catch up. Despite Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s continual rejection of the charge, he deepened the chasm between the haves and the have nots. While the Minister refers to improved taxation figures, the reality for ordinary people is that stealth taxes &mdash; I know the Minister is not fond of that term &mdash; impact on their living conditions.</P>
      <P>What are we looking at? We are looking at ever-spiralling refuse charges. Some of these are not directly under the Minister&rsquo;s charge but they are a product of Government decisions over these years. Refuse charges continue to increase at an inordinate rate, causing huge problems for many people and for society as a whole in terms of illegal waste disposal, which I deplore.</P>
      <P>There are measures that come under the control of the Minister and his associates, such as the threshold for the drugs payment scheme has increased twice in 18 months from &euro;70 to &euro;85. The Minister may think that is not much, but that &euro;15 increase makes a critical difference for people in terms of access to medication. There are increased overnight in-hospital charges and accident and emergency visitation fees. These all impact on the standard of living and spending power of ordinary people and those affected most are the least well-off. There is now paid parking in almost every town, something that did not exist in the greater part of rural Ireland some years ago.</P>
      <P>The issue is not only what the Minister has done but what he has not done in terms of failure to address the spiralling cost of housing. He and his colleagues oppose grappling with that matter, but it has an enormous effect on ordinary families.</P>
      <P>While inflation is relatively low, measures can be taken to control it better, and make no mistake, it has a direct impact. These amendments seek to factor that into all the different areas of taxation assessment.</P>
      <P>There were excise and other increases in recent years. I acknowledge the Minister did not increase excise in his first budget and I congratulate him on that. I hope he maintains that stance. The increases that were introduced have made a huge difference and have eroded, like it or not, and I do not like it, the gains the Minister is so proud to laud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>They have not eroded the gains. That is precisely the point. Clearly, when the model is changed and personal tax rates and tax on labour are reduced so that work and risk are promoted, other things change. There is nothing for nothing.</P><Col N="677"/>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned local authority charges. Many local authorities, some of which do not have a Fianna F&aacute;il majority, are introducing pay by weight schemes. Increased local government funds have been provided.</P>
      <P>I introduced the drugs payment scheme and I am very proud of it because previously people had to pay the entire amount, wait three months and then send in the bill. Now families pay on the first &euro;85 or whatever and if it is &euro;500 they do not have to wait for three months for the health board to go through a circular administrative system to get their money back. The proof of the pudding from a Department of Finance point of view is that hospital drugs are escalating very significantly. The cost of the general medical services board is escalating. Thankfully, despite marginal changes and accident and emergency charges, four out of five presenting do not require accident and emergency service, sometimes because they have primary care in their community at certain times of the week. There is a purpose for some of these things.</P>
      <P>On the question of high parking costs, its purpose is to provide more money for amenities. How many times have I heard councillors during the past 20 years crying for more autonomy and more rights to raise funds to enable them provide money for local amenities? These provisions are now becoming law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>To suggest that factoring it in wipes away the benefit is not winning the argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is an effective point. Things have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making the point that if one takes the &euro;12,000 example in 1995-96, which is now &euro;20,000, the reduction in the average rate for PAYE and PRSI is down from 25.8% to 17.3%. To bring it down to brass tacks, it is additional disposable income. There is an additional &euro;3,500 in that person&rsquo;s pocket today if he or she was earning &euro;12,000 then and got an inflationary increase in wages in the past ten years. That additional disposable income will pay for plenty of charges. No matter how many times one parks one&rsquo;s car in Monaghan town or how many bins one puts out every week to make up the &euro;3,500, it would be a full time job to calculate the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Even in the budgets where there have been no increases in the bands, PAYE credit was increased and reduced the tax paid by PAYE workers. It is also the case that there were no major changes in the VAT rate in recent years.</P>

It is like everything, one cannot compare apples with oranges all the time, although sometimes we all do so to exaggerate the point. The Deputy will find nobody in Monaghan on that wage who has to pay that rate to the local authority. Even an authority with seven Sinn F&eacute;in councillors could not make it happen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The indexation issue would be a strait-jacket for any Minister or Government and would take from their democratic responsibility to make choices for the good of the community, such as targeting those on the minimum wage in the last budget. It is about choices. I do not agree with the idea that the use of the CPI is almost like a formula across the board, following which one can do what one likes. My attitude is that one should make one&rsquo;s choices and defend them and not wait for unanimity, otherwise none of us would ever make a decision. I made my choices. I targeted where I targeted. Others, such as the Deputies opposite, can table amendments, and we can have an argument about it. I am not saying I am more correct than the Deputy but I have done my budget. This is the Finance Bill and I am not changing it now.</P>
      <P>The average industrial wage has been raised many times. If the bands are not increased it moves up the marginal rates over time. Most people understand this, in the same way as a farmer understands that one has a good year and a bad year. If things are going well one gets on better whereas if things are going badly one cannot expect as much and one will not get on as well. We should stop telling the people that they can be assured from hereon that there will be incremental increased improvement in their life until the day they die and that there will be a tax regime that will keep them at this level. We are at this level now as a result of good strategy, a broad consistent macro-economic policy, by all governments despite efforts to suggest otherwise, some doing the job better than others, perhaps, but that is always a matter of political debate.</P>
      <P>Let us not tell the people that this is the way it is going to be regardless. There are many things happening and we need to keep ahead of the <Col N="679"/>posse and not become smug or complacent. There may be a time when some Minister has to made a decision in the event of an international downturn. We are an open economy and anything can happen in the next few years. Ministers have to come into this House and make some decisions which may not be popular. We have to make such decisions if we want to do our job and defend them. We should never underestimate the people&rsquo;s discernment or their ability to acknowledge what has been done. If that is what one has to do this year that is what one has to do. I do not buy the argument that there has to be improvements all the way regardless of what happens. I hope there will be improvements but nobody who understands how the economy works can be that certain and suggest the framework for the foreseeable future by, for example, locking in indexation. We should not do that.</P>

When he has 84 Members to back the party he can come into this House and implement it. In the meantime I am defending this model and the way it works. There may be criticisms of aspects of it but on any objective analysis &mdash; be it applied to workers, income tax, ensuring more people are at work and have a chance to improve their position and that those at home have greater disposable income &mdash; there is no doubt, no matter how we argue the issue, the ordinary punters believe they are in a better position than they have been for a long time. That is my honest opinion. When speaking with them they confirm that and are aware it does not happen automatically. Neither do they think it is guaranteed for the future.

	<P>I did not. I said it has its costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Everything has a cost. It is interesting that the Minister has defended and made a cogent argument as to why the well-off should be even better off. If the Minister looks at the statistics from Patrick Clancy and others on who went to college before the introduction of free tuition fees at university level, the tax covenants that were available only to the wealthy &mdash; the Minister will remember the figures as he was part of that Government &mdash; were costing more in tax expenditure than giving free third-level under graduate tuition fees. That was the choice that was made and, if I remember correctly the Minister was a party to it. I am aware there are many politically correct people like the Minister who still consider there was something fundamentally wrong with the children of those on modest incomes having access to third level education. It was all right for farmers&rsquo; children to get grants to go to college but it was different for people living and working in towns and cities throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should not misrepresent my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>A bus driver&rsquo;s children could not go to college because their income was too high for a grant whereas somebody on farming income &mdash; and I say good luck to them because I think they should get it &mdash; could vary their income when their children were coming up to college age and they would get a grant. To add to that, the people who were really well-off could take out a covenant. The cost of the covenant in tax foregone was very significant at the time and almost fully if not totally funded the cost of opening up university and third level access to everybody.</P>
      <P>If the Minister reintroduces third level fees, as he is hinting he might like to do, he will also return and introduce tax breaks. Who will the tax breaks particularly benefit? They will benefit the better-off. This argument is not about who is or is not pro-economic development; I am in favour of economic development. We are talking about spreading the fruits around. If I may say so, I would have thought the events of the past month would have made the Minister much more aware of this. It costs &euro;800 a month for child care because both parents must work all the hours God sends in order to be able to buy what was traditionally regarded as a right &mdash; a private house. The Minister should talk to those people who get up at 6 a.m. to leave children into a cr&egrave;che and who do not return home until 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>As well as economic prosperity and growth, there is the quality of life aspect to the debate. I <Col N="681"/>do not have the figures with me but on the indices in respect of quality of life in the European Union, such as access to transportation, Ireland unfortunately still ranks about 15 out of 16. I will bring the statistics with me to the House tomorrow if statistics are being traded. These are important statistics about quality of life.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister regularly pays &euro;1.80 to cross the West Link toll bridge. The cost has risen significantly in recent years. The bridge is in my constituency. Drivers pay that money in order to take part in one of the largest parked traffic jams in Europe. The Minister can correctly say that as an economy we are delighted to have more employment, delighted that people are doing better and that incomes have risen but what he cannot deny is that the cost of living in Ireland for families is extremely high in critical aspects such as the cost of health.</P>
      <P>I do not know the cost of a GP visit in County Offaly but in the Dublin area it would be difficult to visit a GP at a cost of under &euro;40 and many GPs charge &euro;45 to &euro;50. A prescription will cost anything from &euro;20 to &euro;30. If a bug hits an entire family and if some of the children are slightly asthmatic, a very high proportion of that family&rsquo;s after-tax income will be used to pay for services that in other EU countries are paid for by taxes. If the Minister was to use the West Link toll bridge to drive home, he would pay &euro;1.80 to sit in one of the biggest traffic jams in Europe.</P>
      <P>I welcome that the Minister wishes to have a debate about balance. In a debate about balance, one must examine where people have definitely made gains &mdash; and I agree people have made gains &mdash; but in any notion of a fair society, which the Minister has indicated is one of his aims &mdash; one cannot have the situation where some people flaunt themselves as paying no contribution. If those people were in a traffic accident, I presume they would unfortunately end up in the same accident and emergency unit as the rest of us. As they drive their top of the range Mercedes, I think they use the same roads as the rest of us because I see them. When they pop over in their helicopter for the day, I think they use the same airport facilities that the rest of us pay for. The equity question is that we want a fair contribution from everybody and we want the Minister and the Government to acknowledge that for quite a number of families in this society, this is an expensive country. Services are difficult to access, they are awkward to get and they are very costly when they come out of after-tax income if one has a family of small children. Child care can be a crippling burden.</P>
      <P>It sometimes seems that nobody on the Government benches is really getting this message because they are so taken with the success side of the equation. The Minister is entitled to sell the success and he sells it very well but he needs to undertake a listening exercise in respect of the side that is not going so well. As the Minister stated, politics is about making decisions; some people like the decisions and others do not. <Col N="682"/>It was interesting that the Minister did not get worked up about some of the property-based tax reliefs. Both the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste have said to me on several occasions that they do not find it acceptable that someone on an income of more than &euro;200,000 should make no tax contribution.</P>
      <P>In a speech last weekend the Minister said he was going to &ldquo;weed out&rdquo; some of the people in the system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I never used that phrase &ldquo;weed out&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who were paying no tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I never used that word &ldquo;weed out&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It may have been RTE getting him wrong again. I think it was the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments that were being described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine. The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste both said to me, from where the Minister is now sitting, that they do not find it acceptable. They think it is not acceptable that people on an income of more than &euro;200,000 should pay no contribution. This does not really excite the Minister&rsquo;s disapproval; what excites his disapproval is the most important measure to open up access to third level education ever taken in this country. I used to work in third level education and I know quite a bit about it. Professor Clancy&rsquo;s recent report shows that the measure is really working in terms of Dublin city. One can look at the postal districts in the Dublin area &mdash; and this may also be true in respect of Tullamore or Birr &mdash; and one could pick the estates where almost no children progressed to third level education and the other parts of the city or town where almost anyone with any level of academic achievement proceeded to third level education. It seems to be politically correct on the part of all sorts of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>On a point of information.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is misrepresenting my position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>May I state my position? Why does the Deputy not wish to hear my position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I find it odd. I invite the Minister and his officials to look at Professor Clancy&rsquo;s work, which shows how access has been opened up. I refer to the CIE bus supervisor. That person&rsquo;s children were not able to access third level <Col N="683"/>education but they are now able to do so. Like free secondary education, this has been one of the best steps forward this country has taken. I am sure the Minister will agree that the employment future lies in knowledge-based industry and development. Deciding to pull back on helping as many people as possible to access third level education is not desirable. It is interesting that the Minister has highlighted that measure out of all the range.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy give way? I wish to correct the record of the House. The issue arose in the context of whether the measure is progressive. My criticism is that the Labour Party provided free third level education regardless of income and it is now enjoyed by the children of millionaires and those earning &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 per annum. My point is that it was not targeted. I am in favour of everyone attending university if he or she so wishes. The Fianna F&aacute;il Party has a good record on education which I invite any party to surpass. My point, however, is that as a result of the lack of focus in applying the measure regardless of income, fewer people than we would like receive maintenance grants because we have decided to spend the money elsewhere. Let us be intellectually honest. The Deputy made the same point in another way when she criticised the decision to give everyone aged over 70 years a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister to give way. He should not put words in my mouth as I have never criticised that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not put words in the Deputy&rsquo;s mouth and have no problem giving way if I misrepresent her personal position. However, I have heard criticisms from the Labour Party benches to the effect that millionaires now have a medical card if aged over 70 years. Although the Deputy may not have made them, they are on record.</P>
      <P>I made exactly the same point with regard to free fees at third level and the Deputy seeks to misrepresent my position by arguing that I do not care about ordinary working people attending college. The Deputy has also stated no one on the Government benches understands child care. When social progressives such as the Deputy were in government, their commitment to child care amounted to a pilot programme costing &euro;1 million.</P>

      <P LI="2">&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is amended by the substitution of the following for subsection (2):</P>
      <P LI="3">&lsquo;(2) Where in any year of assessment an individual proves that he or she is a qualifying claimant he or she shall be entitled to a tax credit (to be known as the &ldquo;home carer tax credit&rdquo;) of a sum equal to the higher of the amount specified in section 472 of this Act.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Under current arrangements, an adult who stays at home to look after family members may avail of the home carer&rsquo;s tax allowance which amounts to a tax credit of &euro;770 per annum. The amendment proposes that this tax credit be substantially increased to enable one spouse in a family to stay at home and look after children. The Minister decided this year not to alter the current rate and set out his reasons on Committee Stage. The credit needs to be increased dramatically.</P>
      <P>Home carer&rsquo;s tax credit is claimed by approximately 100,000 persons, which implies that 100,000 families have only one income and meet the qualifying criterion that they have a dependent child or ill family member in need of care. Already one income families suffer considerable discrimination. Let us take as an example two families with an overall income of &euro;56,000 in 2004, one of which has one income while the other has two. The couple with one income will have paid &euro;7,000 more in income tax than the second couple. This is unfair and penalises spouses who decide to stay at home and look after their families. Given that forcing people to work can have serious consequences for society and in the light of current child care costs, we should promote an economic option which would allow one spouse to stay at home. This is the con<Col N="686"/>text in which I move the amendment and hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Minister had an opportunity to celebrate International Women&rsquo;s Day yesterday, although I gather from his gesture that he missed the chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We will go out and celebrate when international men&rsquo;s day comes around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>We will make special arrangements next year. I understand the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, celebrated and hope he enjoyed himself.</P>
      <P>The Minister made several interesting comments on child care and child benefit. He referred to the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, which I have examined in detail, particularly as it operates in my constituency, one of the fastest growing areas in the country, and the Fingal County Council area. The Minister, some of whose officials are present, would be shocked to learn of the astonishing administrative costs associated with the EOCP. Area Development Management Limited submitted a bill of approximately &euro;8 million just to administer the programme.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware from his own constituency that most community organisations which applied for funding under the EOCP have been so mired in the red tape associated with filling in application forms that take-up is proportionally much higher among private providers than community based facilities, even though the programme is, in theory, primarily geared towards the latter.</P>
      <P>A significant factor emerging with regard to child care is the cost differential in cr&egrave;che charges for small babies and newborns, on the one hand, and older children, on the other. In the Leinster region, the area with which I am most familiar, I have noted that while many professional cr&egrave;ches generally charge &euro;180 to &euro;220 per month, significantly higher charges apply to newborns and young babies because of the understandably high level of care and number of staff required for this group.</P>
      <P>I agree with the principle of Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment. Families with children must be offered realistic choices. Rather than doing the commuter run, being stuck in a car for an hour and a half going to and from work, it should be made attractive for families to enable one parent to stay at home longer than the four to six months provided for. It should be an absolute part of policy that every parent of a child under one year has the opportunity to stay at home with the child. Flexibility should also be allowed between the parents as in some cases the father may wish to stay at home.</P>
      <P>Most European states have moved in this direction. The Minister mentioned attending ECOFIN meetings. The next time he is in a European air<Col N="687"/>port for such a meeting, he should look at some of the advertisements to see what our European counterparts are offering to young families to encourage them to have not just one but two or three children. He must know from civil servants with whom he has worked that in the Irish child care scenario the cost for one child is expensive but possible. However, for those families with three children, one parent is obliged to give up work or find another career.</P>
      <P>I support the spirit of Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment because this is a critical and important issue. Considering the lifestyles many young parents must endure, many are heroic. They have to get up early in the morning to drop their children off at a child care facility before commuting to work. As well as the responsibilities and sleepless nights that go with having children, families are supposed to be fun. Talking to voters in counties Meath and Kildare in recent weeks, I noted many were enduring, not enjoying, family life. It is beholden on every Member to address this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot claim the answer is the equal opportunities child care programme. Can he examine and check the reviews carried out on it? Will he pity the community groups which have tried to fill in the forms and failed? As a consequence, many have not benefited from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell&rsquo;s largesse. Much spin accompanies the programme. While I welcome some funding as opposed to none, I have grave reservations about the quality of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister spoke of the philosophical differences between his party and the Opposition parties. This is nowhere more marked than in this provision in the Finance Bill. His predecessor believes his greatest achievement was individualisation of the tax system. The reality is very different. If anything, those measures saw the introduction of a two tier society with the rewarding of greed. The message it conveyed was that the role in society of a social actor, parent, carer, volunteer, was the lesser. If one is to be properly recognised in society, one has to be a vibrant economic actor. Although this is the Minister&rsquo;s first budget&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is my 20th.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;he must take this on board if he wants to leave an imprint on the type of society that will result from his economic policies. The ugly side of the Celtic tiger is the imprint left by his predecessor. It is those policies that we, on this side of the House, continue to oppose. The Minister has an opportunity to reverse and ameliorate his predecessor&rsquo;s effects on child care and caring in the home policies.</P>
      <P>While I support Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment, wider debate and policy proposals are needed in this area. It is unfortunate the Govern<Col N="688"/>ment is silent on how it intends to deal with the issue. Deputy Burton spoke of the mixed signals coming from the Government, particularly with community provision of child care. At the end of December letters from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated funding could not be guaranteed for such facilities beyond 31 August 2005. While we are talking about the lack of proper recognition within the tax system, the Government, through another Department, is reviewing whatever level of support is available. Those providing much needed facilities will now be told to fend for themselves in an uncertain future.</P>
      <P>This is what we have encountered when canvassing in County Meath and north Kildare. While these two constituencies will get more than enough name-checks until next Friday, this issue affects communities throughout the State. In inner city communities the only alternative child care provision is through the community. However, the Government is not offering any long-term support in this regard. The balance must be struck for a tax on social welfare support and wider grant aid support. However, there is no chance of balancing both sides of this equation. It requires the very political willingness the Government lacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support amendment No. 11 in Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s name. The largest weakness in the budget was the failure to address the issue of child care and children&rsquo;s needs. This went across the board in the Government&rsquo;s failure to reach its own targets in child benefit. Several agencies at the coalface have demonstrated these targets are essential in meeting the costs of providing for children. I expect the Minister for Finance will address this matter in his next budget. The absence of any substantive provision in the last budget was so glaring that he and his colleagues cannot fail to recognise the import of correcting it at the next opportunity.</P>
      <P>In recent years a number of measures providing for a parent&rsquo;s right to take up full-time parenting have been introduced. However, no incentives have been given for parents to do so. For the first 12 months parents have the right to be absent from work commitments to enable them to provide for the needs of their children. This aspect, very much part of society in the past, has now changed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The right of all parents to maintain or to access workplace opportunities is an absolute. However, it is not enough just to affirm the rights of parents in terms of workplace law and regulation to take up full-time parenting. We also have a responsibility to ensure measures are introduced which go some way towards compensating for the significant income loss that will arise and which offer incentive in order that people will seriously consider the option by perceiving that it is not as punitive an alternative as is often the case.</P><Col N="689"/>
      <P>What we are looking at here is the introduction of a tax credit in regard to the home carer role. Primarily, that applies to the role of either father or mother dealing with the needs of children in the home place. It is an eminently sensible proposition. I am interested to hear more about the prescribed methodology of its application but I am also interested to hear what the Minister has to say on this proposition. I hope he will use the opportunity to indicate positively his intent to address the whole area of parenting, child care and the needs of children in our society, which have been so markedly overlooked in budget 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment relates to the home carers tax credit of &euro;770, which under section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, is granted to married couples where one spouse works at home to care for children, the aged and incapacitated person. The amendment proposes that the amount of the home carer credit should be the same as the maximum of the employee tax credit, commonly known as the PAYE credit which, by virtue of section 3 of the Bill, would amount to &euro;1,270. In other words, the amendment seeks to increase the value of the home carer tax credit by &euro;500 per year. It is estimated that to increase the home carer tax credit, as proposed, would cost approximately &euro;40.5 million in 2005 and &euro;59.2 million in a full year.</P>
      <?oasys _dc14-?><P>As I indicated in my Budget Statement last December, the total cost of the income tax and levy changes I made is &euro;682 million in a full year, which is more than double the previous year&rsquo;s total. The increase I made in the employee tax credit, in addition to benefiting all workers, was to ensure that all those on the minimum wage are fully outside the tax net. I have decided not to increase the home carer tax credit on this occasion. However, it is worth noting that couples who benefit from the credit will benefit in this budget from the increase in the employee tax credit and the personal tax credit which I have announced. For example, a married one income earner on PAYE with two children and a salary of &euro;40,000 will gain &euro;838 in total in this budget. It is made up from &euro;350 in tax credits, &euro;380 in band widening and &euro;180 in child benefit. It is an issue at which we will continue to look in the future.</P>
    <?oasys _dc0-?></Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister is not prepared to move any way towards increasing the home carer spouse allowance. This allowance was introduced following the introduction of individualisation by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. It resulted from a backlash among Government backbenchers who were not happy with individualisation and felt the family with the single income was being seriously discriminated against. Families with one income are still seriously discriminated against. That discrimination is greatest among those on middle incomes, namely, those earning &euro;55,000 to &euro;56,000 per annum. There is a substantial differ<Col N="690"/>ence in the amount of tax paid by a single income family and a double income family. It amounts to approximately &euro;7,000 per annum, which is a lot of money. That takes into account the home carer spouse allowance.</P>
      <P>Increasing the home carer spouse allowance would go some way towards helping those people. The Minister has heard the arguments before that people who want to stay at home to look after their children should have that option. This Government should help to eliminate the economic difficulties preventing that from happening. I ask the Minister to review this allowance. If he is still in office at the end of the year, perhaps he might be able to give us good news in this regard in his second budget. It is not that costly in the context of the benefit it would have. The Minister estimated the cost at approximately &euro;40 million. When one considers the cost of other things and the benefit this would have, it would be well worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have noted what the Deputies have said. To answer Deputy Boyle&rsquo;s point, it is not just a question of portraying it in the context of being vibrant economic and social actors. It is really a function of social change in this country, with a higher participation rate by women in the workforce. It is more in line with continental trends than was the case in the past. People are pursuing careers. The opening up of educational opportunities for all has provided us with that change. That social change is something we are trying to reflect in our code. It does not mean one thinks less of those who stay at home by choice. I am a one income married parent.</P>
      <P>We must continue to work on how we deal with this issue. We must increase supply and we must realise the tax system itself has deficiencies in dealing with this matter in terms of discriminating against those who pay low income tax or no income tax. Those on lower incomes would not be able to avail of such a child care tax.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme is providing more places. Deputy Burton has some views on this matter. In my own town last week, the paper work came through in that regard. I know of other community based organisations in my area which have been successful due to their own initiative. I am not claiming any credit for it. It is an issue around which we are trying to get our heads in terms of what is the adequate policy response without causing further problems and further discriminatory effects.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Paul McGrath said, the home carer allowance was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. There were a number of budgetary changes to assist the married one income earner in that situation, not specifically in terms of increasing this tax credit, but other changes which increased the disposable income of such families and, indeed, of other families. We continue to work on this issue to see what other initiatives, if any, might be possible to assist in the already very considerable resources afforded to this area <Col N="691"/>through the mechanisms Government has decided on. They are not such as to meet the cost of child care but they are a contribution and an acknowledgement of that cost.</P>
      <P>It would be a help if there were more child care places. More places are envisaged and there has been an increased allocation in this year&rsquo;s Estimates for that programme to meet demand. As people know, we have used the capital allowances system in respect of employers providing such facilities in places of employment for employees. We are responding from a standing start in 1997. There are no simple solutions. We continue to reflect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise there is no simple solution. The Minister has clearly identified a problem. He has also recognised that there is social change. The question is how do we respond to it. The issues the Minister mentioned are mainly based around providing money for child care facilities. What we are talking about is giving people the opportunity of not working for one, two or three years while their children are very small and of surviving on one income. That is what is at stake.</P>
      <P>The Minister is addressing other issues. There is a tremendous number of women at work, a huge number of two income families. We welcome this. A number of those two income families would like for a short period to have the opportunity for one of the spouses to stay at home to look after the family. This House has not given them the facility to take one to three years out of the workforce. What we are talking about is making it economically feasible for people to take time out for a relatively short period to get their children started at school and so on. The &euro;770 home carer&rsquo;s tax credit does not come near enough to bridging the gap. The Minister recognises the difficulty and I think I hear him saying the right things, that he will look at it for inclusion next year. In the context of my interpretation that he will look at it for inclusion next year, I withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Dr. Cowley)</NameTxt>
	<P>We now come to amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy Burton. Amendment No. 15 is related. Amendments Nos. 12 and 15 may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall review tax relief arrangements for private nursing homes to determine their compatibility with health criteria and in particular health and welfare related criteria regarding the size and location of facilities.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="692"/>
      <P FLI="0">I appreciate the Minister may not have had an opportunity to get a full briefing on this issue when I raised it last week on Committee Stage. During his predecessor&rsquo;s time there was a move to give very generous tax breaks of up to 42% to people who made capital investments in various medical and nursing home facilities. The T&aacute;naiste, in her role as Minister for Health and Children, seems determined to privatise as much of our health and care systems as possible. While she may be ideologically driven in her desire to do so, we need a debate on whether it is appropriate. I mention this in the context of the development of large numbers of private nursing homes with generous tax breaks of 42% provided that they continue to operate as nursing homes for a maximum period of only ten years. We do not know what will happen at the end of that period. Will they continue to provide nursing care or will they move into another area?</P>
      <P>Regardless of any kind of joined up policy on social provision, the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor said on a number of occasions that he had expanded these areas of medical and social care related tax breaks on the basis of a hunch or what had been said by whoever he happened to meet in the run-up to his various budgets. He met somebody who told him about the difficulty of getting a psychological assessment for their child and that change was brought forward in one year. He met somebody else, a doctor in his constituency, who talked about tax breaks for private hospitals and that was brought forward on Report Stage two years ago. Similarly, the provision of nursing home tax breaks was made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any study that indicates what role this plays in the long-term provision of quality care for older people. I reiterate that all the evidence from Age Action Ireland and other groups which deal with older people in society is that the overwhelming preference of older people is to stay at home, either with or in the vicinity of their families, and as they become older and more dependent, they should still be able to live independently but with increasing support. If that is the model to be followed, it is certainly not the logic of the tax breaks the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor sponsored.</P>
      <P>I spoke about the Hanly report which laid down various criteria regarding survival sizes &mdash; 300 to 400 beds &mdash; for hospitals and certain facilities. About one year ago that was the gospel according to the Government. When it comes to policy on tax breaks for health and social provision, there seems to be no study. I do not know whether the Department of Finance ever even sent a note to the Department of Health and Children or the Department of Social and Family Affairs on the various tax breaks being introduced.</P>
      <P>I have raised the issue of the proliferation of nursing homes in the Leinster region which are out of town, a mile or two away from villages. While the physical finish of these homes may be very good, the opportunity for an old person who <Col N="693"/>goes into one of these homes to live any kind of independent life is severely curtailed unless their family are highly supportive on a regular basis. Most of the nursing homes in rural Ireland, including in north County Dublin in the Fingal area where they are proliferating, are very remote. There are no footpaths. The nearest village is probably well over a mile away. The majority of the residents of nursing home facilities are more than 70 or 75 years of age and not up to walking a mile or a mile and a half on a road without a footpath where cars travel at very high speeds. Consequently, they have no access to their church, the pub or the post office. They have no access even to a Spar shop if they want to buy a few things for themselves.</P>
      <P>The amendment is reasonable. The criteria should be linked to compatibility with health and welfare in terms of the size and location of the facility. When we look back to this tax break in ten years&rsquo; time, we will see some nursing homes which will have made excellent provision and which will continue to do so. We will also see others, which were basically interim development strategies by developers who bought land at auction with an eye to future housing developments in areas like Fingal and the parts of Leinster near Dublin city. The old farmhouse or other buildings on such land will be converted to nursing home use resulting in extensive tax breaks. Ten years hence the developer may be far more optimistic that Fingal, Meath or Kildare county councils will allow full-scale housing development on the site and the nursing home facility will go. It will be used for some other purpose, probably housing development.</P>
      <P>The nursing home tax break should have conditions. The Minister cannot tell me the number of nursing homes availing of this tax break or the cost of it. His predecessor has led him down the road of providing very significant tax breaks affecting elderly people, which do not emphasise independent welfare criteria for older people such as affording them as much independence as is possible for as long as is possible. Entering a nursing home should be the last resort for our older population rather than the first resort, which is the result of giving upfront tax breaks.</P>
      <P>At budget time the Minister for Finance has some influence on departmental budgets. It is disappointing that some local authorities make no provision for sheltered supported housing for older people. Other authorities, for example Dublin City Council, are fantastic at doing so. The sheltered facilities and apartments it provides are superb and allow a high level of independence. As the Acting Chairman, Deputy Glennon, will know, Fingal County Council is decades behind Dublin City Council in this regard. If a pot of money is available to places like Blanchardstown, the Naul and Garristown most Deputies and most families would prefer to support those kinds of facilities for older people in sites in or near villages where people aged over 75 years can still go for a walk, visit the pub, go <Col N="694"/>to Mass and do whatever they want to do. This is what keeps people young and alive. The staff in most nursing homes are excellent. Even if the quality of care is excellent, by placing them in an out of the way nursing home, they are nearly getting a life sentence. They will not come out again as independent individuals.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor introduced many tax breaks without any examination of the social, welfare and medical criteria, which should have accompanied them. I ask the Minister to do this from hereon. On Committee Stage the Minister gave us figures for increases in nursing home numbers. Crude increases in nursing home numbers are pointless without a good model of care. Presumably in 20 or 30 years&rsquo; time, or perhaps later, 5% to 10% of those in this Chamber may, because of medical need, be dependent on having to use a nursing home facility. If the Minister wants to give tax breaks, they should be targeted at independent living in an environment where the older person can resource facilities. I gave the example of towns with a nursing home on the main street, which allows visitors ease of access. This is preferable to the proliferation of nursing homes in remote locations, driven by the tax breaks with no consideration for welfare or health criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment and will also speak to amendment No. 15. Deputy Burton has made the points about isolation very well. I recognise the picture she has painted. However, but for the new private nursing home facilities completed in recent years in my constituency, we would have a serious crisis in the provision of nursing home places in Cavan and Monaghan. That is a fact of life. This tells us that there has been serious under-investment in public nursing home provision. Many people by preference or need would opt in the first instance for the public facility, which in the case of St. Mary&rsquo;s in Castleblaney in my county of Monaghan is <i>par excellence</i> and is a wonderful facility.</P>
      <P>I will share a point with Deputy Burton, who spoke about getting out to visit the pub. I pay tribute to a former county manager in Monaghan, who died last year in his 90s and who with great foresight many years ago introduced the very first little bar in a public nursing home facility in St. Mary&rsquo;s in Castleblaney. At the time he said that he was only thinking of himself and his future. While he acted very wisely and with great foresight, he never had to use the facility except as a visitor. It is a wonderful facility, which allows visitors and residents the opportunity to have a drink together and converse in a pleasant environment. I commend such facilities to other nursing homes.</P>
      <P>I recall what Deputy Cowley said last night on another Bill making its way through the House with great haste when he referred to the community sector. The vision shown by Deputy Cowley and his community in the establishment <Col N="695"/>of St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village in Mulranny in County Mayo is the greatest example of community nursing home care. I personally commend the Deputy for his dedication and commitment to that sector over many years. I have had the opportunity to visit St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village and, as anyone would be, I was greatly impressed.</P>
      <P>Development within the community sector is largely embryonic. The public sector is critically under-funded and under-resourced. Insufficient public places are available allowing the opportunity for the development of private nursing home care particularly when one remembers that the Health Service Executive, formerly the health boards, is buying bed access in private nursing facilities to compensate for the absence of places in the public sector. This reminds me of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s, Deputy Harney&rsquo;s, great love for buying hospital procedures as opposed to providing for them within the network of acute hospital care.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s preferences towards the private sector need careful watching on the part of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues. I do not believe the Minister reflects the views she has been proud to articulate when she said, for instance, she wishes to see minimal State intervention, including in health care provision. That is an incredible statement by a Minister for Health and Children. Following the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that inequality is good for the economy, it must be a worrying relationship for the Minister for Finance and others whom I would credit with a much more acute awareness of social need.</P>
      <P>These amendments are not prescriptive. They seek a commitment on the Minister&rsquo;s part to a review in order to determine the tax return. A careful assessment must be made of what is due to the Exchequer in terms of tax relief arrangements and reliefs in terms of public moneys. The highest standards should always apply in regard to the exercise of these reliefs. It is particularly important that they are weighed up as part of the ongoing review the Minister established following budget 2005 of the long list of capital-based reliefs covering a wide range of areas from high-rise cark park facilities and holiday homes to private nursing homes and other private clinic facilities.</P>
      <P>Critically, private nursing home reliefs must be compatible with health and welfare criteria. This must be seen in the round in regard to our failure to properly resource public nursing home provision as a consequence of seeking to look after private interests in terms of investors. There is not a balanced approach under the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children in terms of supporting the community sector for which Deputy Cowley argued so articulately yesterday. The influence of the Progressive Democrats Party on the Government&rsquo;s approach, both fiscally and <Col N="696"/>otherwise, means there is every reason to be greatly concerned.</P>
      <P>I strongly urge the Minister to undertake the propositions in amendments Nos. 12 and 15. In the light of the information consequently provided, we must make an informed decision as to what then should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will be suitably shocked should the imminent report on tax reliefs contain the obvious conclusion that many of these reliefs were introduced without any cost-benefit analysis and that many of them have continued in the absence of such analysis. However, cost-benefit analysis alone is an empty formula for deciding many policy objectives. These amendments highlight the importance of asking questions when tax reliefs are introduced as to whether they not only constitute good usage of public money but also whether they achieve good public policy goals in the areas of health and social welfare provision.</P>
      <P>The Government has been shown to be engaging in much double-think in that tax reliefs have caused damage in other areas of social policy. Many such reliefs have caused enormous environmental damage, for instance, but continue to be offered. The Minister must not only consider the merits of these amendments but must also consider the wider issues of how such reliefs are introduced in the future and how they are maintained in subsequent Finance Bills. There must be a new set of criteria by which these measures are judged. It is not merely a question of financial and economic concerns.</P>
      <P>In regard to supports for nursing homes, the Minister spoke on Second and Committee Stages about the increase in the number of places. There is no doubt the additional provision has been helpful in terms of transferring long-term patients from the hospital system into nursing home settings. It is unfortunate this debate has often involved a view that elderly patients are somehow bed-sitting in respect of places in the public health system. The wider issue is about care of the elderly in general and the lack of a real policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>There are questions to ask about the nursing home system in general. Some such facilities are excellent but there seem to be no defined criteria as to what should be the accepted norm across the service. Some are badly located and others offer poor service but such difficulties do not seem to determine whether they receive appropriate public support through tax relief or otherwise. It is ultimately a question of choices and we have had this discussion in regard to other amendments.</P>
      <P>There must be sufficient cost-benefit analysis and joined-up government in terms of the analysis of the effect of wider public policies but alternative models should also be examined. Can consideration be given to a type of tax relief that would allow for the care of incapacitated elderly relatives within the private home? The argument <Col N="697"/>might be made that families have a responsibility towards their members but if we are living the lifestyle articulated by the Minister in terms of thrusting, vibrant economic actors who are working increasingly long hours and commuting for four hours every day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Those are the Deputy&rsquo;s words, not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the implication I am picking up and has been the theme followed through by many on the Government benches. If one considers this model and the associated circumstance in which young families are being brought up at arm&rsquo;s length, there is an obvious need for incentives that will protect the idea of family within the setting of a family home and protect the care needs of families as far as possible within the local community.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will respond to these amendments positively but also consider how better alternatives can be put in place. I accept the Minister shares government with some who have a more radical view of society in that they see it as a marketplace. However, the Minister has a role to play in recognising that the tax system can be used in an imaginative way to protect and enhance the idea of family and community and the care of all generations in as far as possible in the same place and at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>We have seen a rush to establish private nursing homes throughout the country in recent years. This is fuelled by CSO statistics indicating that the figure of approximately 400,000 people over 65 years of age in 1995 is estimated to increase to 700,000 in 2020. The private sector saw an opportunity in this to provide for the needs of those elderly requiring hospital and nursing home care. From a policy perspective, unfortunately, the other side of the coin is that public beds have been decreasing in numbers over the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister should decide whether Government policy in this regard is to continue to fund the establishment of nursing homes through tax breaks while simultaneously allowing the provision of public beds to diminish. Is the focus to be on providing private nursing home places with the help of the taxpayer, of which people can avail through the help of subvention and other means? Alternatively, will the Government continue to fund public beds in the manner established in the past?</P>
      <P>Another query arises from this which the Minister may not be able to answer today but may do so in due course. In some parts of the country there are significant numbers of publicly funded beds sourced through private nursing homes. In my part of the country and probably in the Minister&rsquo;s part, which come under what was formerly the same health board area, there are virtually no publicly funded beds in private nursing homes. The positions seems to vary greatly from one part <Col N="698"/>of the country to another. In County Donegal there are approximately 200 plus public funded beds in private nursing homes, yet in County Westmeath there are only two and there are none in County Longford. I do not know what the figures are for counties Offaly and Laois, but given that they come under what was formerly the same health board area, I imagine the figures are small.</P>
      <P>If I decided to establish ten nursing homes across the country, would the Minister allow me tax breaks to provide them, or would he advise there are enough nursing homes in one area and none in another and that if I wished to avail of a tax break I should establish them in that area where they are needed? What criteria apply to such a tax break? Will the Minister allow bigger units to be established which will eventually snuff out some of the smaller units?</P>
      <P>A good model of provision exists in Third World countries which the Minister should consider. Deputy Burton has experience of it having worked there and I have some knowledge of it. When schools were being established in Africa the rule was that a new school could not be established within three miles of an existing school. That requirement ensured a spread in the provision of schools across areas.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister allow nursing homes to continue to mushroom? It will soon get to the stage where some will make it non-viable for others to operate. There will also be stretches of the countryside where there will be none available and in those areas it seems to be Government policy to wind down the number of public beds available. Even though the population is growing older and there is an increasing demand for beds, the State is shirking its responsibility in ensuring that a proportionate number of public beds are maintained. It is a policy issue the Minister should address and on which he should respond.</P>
      <P>I will have some information on this later as I tabled a question to the Minister on the number of public nursing home beds currently around the country and the number that have been available for a number of years and I am sure the reply to that is in my pigeon hole. The Minister might address those issues. In particular, does he intend to allow those providing nursing homes to continue to avail of tax breaks? Is that scheme open-ended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The review does not terminate the relief schemes. We are reviewing them this year and we will make decisions for the future. They continue to operate as heretofore until that review is completed. That is the way the system works.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to suggest that we have a situation which is outside a regulatory framework. There is the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. Where we have a private sector in regard to the provision of health care, we have a regulatory regime in place.</P>
      <P>The substance of amendments Nos. 12 and 15 was considered by the select committee as a result <Col N="699"/>of a similar amendment tabled by Deputy Burton and we had a wide-ranging discussion on the issue. I indicated on Committee Stage that the nursing homes involved are those which come within section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 which are registered under section 4 of that Act. Section 6 of that Act also provides for the making of regulations by the Minister for Health and Children in regard to the standards of these nursing homes. In particular, the regulations provided for under section 6 of the 1990 Act govern adequate and suitable accommodation and they allow the Minister for Health and Children to, among other things, prescribe requirements as to the design, maintenance, repair, cleaning, cleanliness, ventilation, heating and lighting of nursing homes; the accommodation, including the amount of space in bedrooms and wards; the washing facilities and the sanitary conveniences provided; and the food provided for dependent persons in them. Such regulations issued in 1993 as the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 (Statutory Instrument No. 226 of 1993). Accordingly, there is a regulatory system already in place in regard to the registration and operation of these nursing homes and the standards they must meet. This regulatory system was in the past administered by the health boards and will in future be administered by the Health Service Executive.</P>
      <P>It is important that we do not engage in double thinking on this issue. Deputies would acknowledge that if we did not have such an increase in nursing homes we would have a serious problem. This relates to what I said earlier. We need to be pragmatic. We will continue to invest in public nursing home provision. We have been doing that and we are required to do so because of demographic trends in terms of the need to care for the elderly going forward and to plan ahead. There will always be nursing home places in the public sector. There are also nursing home places in the private sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the number of them is decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a question of decreasing the number of them. There may be some nursing homes in the private sector which could and should be criticised in terms of their location or for some other reason, but we should remember that people have lived in the public nursing home sector for years in facilities which predate any private nursing home the Deputy might mention. Some of them date from the last century and some date from the previous century, and I was in a few of them. I was in a position as a result of an increased capital allocation from my predecessor in this office to deal with some of those problems.</P>
      <P>Were we to depend on the public nursing home sector in my county, the Deputy&rsquo;s county or borough, or anywhere else, we would not be able to <Col N="700"/>deal with the numbers. It is as simple as that. While continuing with the commitment to invest in the public nursing home sector, the private nursing home sector is making a serious contribution to nursing home care. Nursing home care is provided on the basis of those who require it. We want people to live in the community for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>We also have a scheme of tax relief for the construction of housing units for the aged and infirm &mdash; for those capable of more independent living. There are community sector developments in an embryonic stage and retirement villages, of which unfortunately, we have had some bad experiences in Wicklow. Sometimes if there is one bad experience of a concept, everyone tends to walk away from it when what we need is to see what lessons can be learnt to improve on the working of the concept.</P>
      <P>There are a range of options available having regard to the level of dependency of the individual concerned. There are conditions and degrees of infirmity among elderly people that require full-time nursing home care. We all know of such needs. Families will do their very best for as long as they possibly can but it gets to a point where a home care nurse will not be able to provide the 24 hour care that is needed. The person concerned will need an institutional or a nursing home setting. In many cases because private nursing home facilities are more recently constructed, they can have better facilities than are available in some public nursing homes, although there are some excellent ones. I say that in the context of recognising the professionalism of everyone who works in these places.</P>
      <P>As we extoll the public nursing home provision, we know in our hearts and souls that there are many facilities which historically we would like to see replaced pretty quickly. They have provided facilities for as long as they possibly could. The Deputy knows of them in his town and I know of them. The people in those facilities did the best they could for as long as they could and we need to try to replace some of those facilities. The Deputy might not see an increase in the numbers of places because we have to remove places that do not meet the standards, but we have also opened new units. I recall that in a facility in Birr food had to be brought across an open yard which probably contravened the regulations. That was the practice until a new community nursing unit was opened. In saying that I am not in any way criticising the staff who worked there. The same position applied in a facility in Mullingar. I recall being in a facility in Thurles on another occasion. I am sure there were people accommodated on the third storey of that facility whose feet had not hit the ground floor since they were admitted, not to talk of some of them making it down to a pub. This facility was in the middle of the town. The design of the facility was no longer relevant to modern care facilities. These are the realities.</P><Col N="701"/>
      <P>There is only a certain amount of money available and we want to do right by these people. That means providing more public funds for public nursing home care. It also means in many cases replacing antiquated and unsuitable facilities despite the efforts of everyone to keep them going for as long as possible with refurbishment works and so on.</P>
      <P>We should acknowledge in a pragmatic way the role that has been played by the private nursing home care sector. The number of nursing home beds has increased by more than 6,000, from less than 7,000 to approximately 13,000, since the end of 1997, when the system of tax relief for nursing home fees was introduced. How many beds would we have if it had not been introduced?</P>
      <P>We should not decry the role of the independent sector. Of course we want to maintain the availability of the best possible facilities for everyone, regardless of income, etc. We understand that basic concept, but we should be pragmatic. We should continue the public investment programme, examine the role that can be played by the independent sector, consider how we can encourage more facilities such as St. Brendan&rsquo;s Village in Mulranny, assess the concept of retirement villages and increase the take-up of the tax relief scheme that is available to help those who do not need full-time nursing care to lead more independent lives. All such matters are positive. I appreciate that people have concerns about capital allowances, for example, but such matters are being examined at present.</P>
      <P>One should not assume that the schemes under review were introduced just to reduce the tax burden of those on high incomes, although I am sure such people have benefitted from the schemes. The system of tax relief for nursing home fees is providing a community benefit. People will sleep tonight in beds of the highest quality in the independent and private sector. How would it reflect on this House if the beds, which were made available through the tax relief scheme, had not been provided? The private sector can provide certain things more quickly because it benefits from greater flexibility in some respects. There was no problem when the health boards contracted out beds in the private sector. If a person from Ferbane were to stay in a contracted bed in a private nursing home in Shinrone, the person&rsquo;s family would be as happy for him or her to be there as they would for him or her to be in Tullamore or Athlone. Families do not mind who is the proprietor or owner of the nursing home as long as a bed is made available for the person who needs it. We should be pragmatic and sensible.</P>
      <P>I would like to be fair to all Members of the House, including my partners in Government. The T&aacute;naiste is as anxious as everyone else to ensure that the elderly receive proper care. All Deputies have family experience of the limitations and constraints of the system. We cannot address such problems as quickly as we would like, but we can and will address them. The independent sector makes an important contribution. <Col N="702"/>I do not suggest that the private sector offers a qualitatively superior service, but I am simply making the point that it offers what people want by providing beds.</P>
      <P>I have reminded those who have claimed there is an absence of regulation that the 1990 Act applies. Those who are worried about tax relief arrangements can rest assured that they will be considered as part of the ongoing comprehensive review of capital allowances under the tax relief schemes. Deputy Burton suggested that the tax relief might work if it were focused in a slightly different area, in addition to this area. Deputy Paul McGrath pointed out that the demographic trends are against us.</P>
      <P>We did not make provision for this tax relief scheme to dump or maroon elderly people in nursing homes in urban or rural areas. That is not the purpose of the scheme, but some people might think it is happening in some instances. The purpose of this tax relief is to ensure that sufficient nursing home placements are available in the private sector for those who need them. Regardless of whatever else one might say about the scheme, one cannot deny that it has helped us to provide an additional 6,000 places over the last eight years. We could not have expected 6,000 places to be provided under the enhanced public capital investment programme, which has funded the replacement of antiquated facilities which needed to be closed. We would not have been able to increase the number of places by means of public provision alone.</P>
      <P>We should be pragmatic and sensible, for example by considering how we can marry the benefits of a public service ethos, which helps to provide public beds, with the efficiency and effectiveness of the private sector, which can quickly deliver beds to the standard set out in the 1990 Act. The House took a decision on the matter 15 years ago. I look forward to hearing the opinions of Deputies when the review of the system of tax relief for nursing home fees has been completed. I would like to issue an open invitation to them to do so. The desired outcome is the expansion of tax relief schemes which focus on the priorities we want to be addressed. Perhaps some of the negative comments about the role the Government has played will be modified in the context of the emerging crisis. The scheme ensures that the private sector can deliver beds quickly. The regulatory framework is in place. We are reviewing the scheme to see how we can provide a broader spectrum of care that is beyond acute hospital care, but is devoted to assisting the elderly as they pass through various degrees of infirmity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, spoke about this issue on a number of occasions. He told me he introduced the system of tax relief for nursing home fees to reduce charges, rather then to increase the supply of beds in nursing homes. I do not see any evidence of a reduction or levelling off in charges. I hope <Col N="703"/>this element will be concluded following the review. Mr. McCreevy established many tax relief schemes on a wing and a prayer &mdash; he often told us he had a hunch. There is no evidence that this matter was researched, or that it formed part of a joined-up health and social welfare policy.</P>
      <P>The many Deputies who have been members of local authorities will be aware that the budget for the adaptation of houses for older people has been absolutely inadequate. All the research shows that living at home assists people in their late 60s and early 70s &mdash; it is what they want to do. We should facilitate that by being generous in adapting homes to cater for people who are becoming less mobile as they get older.</P>
      <P>A private health care provider received extensive coverage in a newspaper this week. I do not know whether the Minister saw the article in question. The provider intends to use the system of tax relief for nursing home fees to fund two &euro;1 million homes, each of which will cost the State &euro;420,000 in taxes foregone. As I said earlier, Dublin City Council could build an entire unit to provide for assisted independent living for that amount of money.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is calling for a review of the pros and cons of the system. I do not suggest that any single model is better than any other model, although the quality and continuity of public provision has been generally quite good, particularly in recent decades as the facilities have been improved. I have proposed amendment No. 12 because I appreciate that the terms of the review are important.</P>

The Minister has taken on board the concerns I expressed about the criteria which might apply for the relief entitlements. We would like the criteria to be clearly focused on health, welfare and justice. As I have said, investment needs to be balanced to support the public and community sectors. I am happy to let the matter rest until the review has been completed. I will not move amendment No. 15. I await the report mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Haughey, Kelleher and Fiona O&rsquo;Malley and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill because I have long held the view that the planning legislation in this area, while not defective in its own right, requires supplementation. I commend Deputy Gilmore for putting this legislation on the agenda. The Bill is by no means a finished product. It is far from it and much work must be done to determine whether it fits into the general matrix of planning legislation. We must determine exactly how it affects the property rights and constitutional rights of developers and property owners. Having said that, it is a very welcome addition to the debate in this area.</P>
        <P>At the heart of this debate is the conflict between the benefits conferred on developers and property owners by the granting of planning permission and their obligations to complete developments in full compliance with the planning permission guidelines. Having practised in this area for some years, I have no doubt that balance is firmly tilted in favour of the developer and property owner. This sort of legislation is very helpful in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have long held the view that the existing statutory penalties simply do not incentivise developers to complete housing estates. We all know there has not been a culture of compliance with planning permission over the years. In fairness, this could have been forgiven in times of poor economic development when the building industry was on its knees. People might have turned the other way to facilitate some form of development and economic activity. However, the circumstances that now obtain are different and we must comply fully and should not tolerate unfinished estates, roads and services, including defective sewerage and water services. Every Member will know of examples.</P>
        <P>Nothing concentrates the mind of a developer, builder or property owner who seeks to undertake a development more than a grant of planning permission. If one needs evidence of this, one need only consider the subject matters of the tribunals of recent years. The obtaining of a grant of planning permission is the key incentive for developers and builders. Legislation provides <Col N="705"/>local authorities with the power, in one form or another, to withhold the granting of planning permission. This adds some strength to the substantial Act of 2000.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>All of the sanctions that are currently in place put an onus on some party other than the developer to ensure compliance with planning permission guidelines. Under the roads and services indemnity which each property owner is given on the completion of an estate, the onus is on the residents or residents&rsquo; association to bring proceedings against the developer. There is no obligation placed on the builder. This legislation provides, for the first time, the stick, albeit a blunt instrument, with which to ensure developers complete estates. It is very welcome and I commend Deputy Gilmore thereon.</P>
        <P>Certain issues require very careful further consideration. For instance, one must consider the extent to which the blunt instrument might infringe upon the constitutional and property rights of developers. We must also consider carefully the possibility that local authorities using this new wide-ranging instrument might be exposed to actions for considerable damages against themselves.</P>
        <P>In Limerick, there are serious cases of non-compliance associated with a number of developments. There is a clear and widely held perception throughout Limerick that the local authority is somehow unable and does not have the teeth to ensure full compliance with development guidelines and therefore I support, in general and in principle, this sort of legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill facilitates local authorities in refusing planning permission to developers who do not finish housing estates properly. The Bill provides that it is the developer rather than the local authority who must go to the High Court. The Bill will also allow residents of a new housing estate to sue the developers when their estates are left unfinished.</P>
        <P>The Bill is effectively amending the Planning and Development Act 2000, a major Act which strengthened considerably the law in this area. Nevertheless, it is time to review its provisions. This Private Members&rsquo; debate has facilitated a very constructive discussion. I commend Deputy Gilmore in that regard.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that, under existing law, a local authority has not refused to give planning permission to a developer owing to his not having finished another estate for which planning permission was granted, as is evidenced from the fact that no local authority has gone to the High Court with the aim or refusing a permission.</P>
        <P>All of us in public life have first-hand experience of this problem. We have all witnessed the frustration of new householders over substandard roads and footpaths, unfinished walls and fences, and greens and open spaces that cannot be mown <Col N="706"/>or used in any way. We have all experienced problems associated with defective sewers and drains. When I was first elected to the local authority in Dublin in 1985, these were major issues for me. My biggest files are those dealing with unfinished estates. This is not so much a problem today because most of the estates in my constituency have been built. Nevertheless, I recognise that it is a very serious problem in the greater Dublin area generally and throughout the country. A record 80,000 units were built last year and therefore there is obviously a problem that needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>The legal implications of this Bill need to be teased out. I welcome the statement by the Minister last night that he would consult the Attorney General on these matters. I look forward to the outcome of this discussion.</P>
        <P>We need to focus on the role of local authorities in planning and development. It is obvious to me and everybody else in this House that local authorities are very slow to take legal action and initiate enforcement proceedings. One must ask whether they have sufficient resources to carry out their functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000. I know the Minister is concerned about this. I welcomed his comment last night to the effect that he would like to examine the matter further to ensure local authorities fulfil their obligations under existing legislation.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that builders are doing well at present. Government policy is to increase the supply of housing. In 2004, 76,954 units were constructed. All of us, particularly new householders, expect fair play from builders given that they are doing well and building many houses. I am not sure we are experiencing such fair play.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment last night that &ldquo;the primary responsibility to build good developments and finish them to a high standard rests with developers&rdquo;. I welcome the call by the Minister on the Construction Industry Federation to lead on this point, keep raising standards and ensure that its members stick to them. Government must also take significant action. I welcome this constructive debate and hope these initiatives can be considered and implemented in the fullness of time, following legal advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome this Bill and to support the good work of my colleague, Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something new for Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Ms F. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>Having served with him on the county council, I know what an authority he is on matters of local government and housing in particular. As constituency colleagues we share the same problems surrounding unfinished housing estates, many of which date back to the 1980s and earlier. The resources provided by the devel<Col N="707"/>opers are not sufficient to address the problems now.</P>
        <P>The Bill is timely and I commend the Minister&rsquo;s magnanimity in accepting it. One drafts legislation according to an ideal but when it does not live up to that one must revisit it. That is why it is particularly useful that Deputy Gilmore presented this Bill to the House and the Minister accepted it.</P>
        <P>The record-breaking housing output in recent successive years strengthens the case for this legislation. We have heard how many housing estates on vast tracts of west Dublin are left incomplete. It is incumbent on us to reverse the position and give the local authorities the right to decide whether it is appropriate for a developer to build a housing estate.</P>
        <P>In my area there is a site whose planning history dates back to the 1950s. The same people have not been involved throughout but those who have occupied it for the past 20 odd years have repeatedly ignored the planning regulations. Local councillors and Deputies must deal with the consequences of that. I welcome the proposal that planning permission may be withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Reputation is one of the most important things we carry through our lives. One likes to think one&rsquo;s reputation is intact but if one gets a reputation for being cavalier about planning regulations that should stick. If one has no care or regard for the citizens who will live in the development, or for the regulations, one should be penalised in some way.</P>
        <P>I read with interest the Minister&rsquo;s speech of last night. He is conscious of the legal issues arising in the sections of this Bill. While I do not share his reservations, it is good advice to seek the opinion of the Attorney General. We can only hope that the Minister&rsquo;s letter arrives swiftly at the Office of the Attorney General and that action is taken on this Bill.</P>
        <P>It is rather far-fetched to suggest that banks might refuse to lend money because they are afraid someone might not get planning permission. We need to move quickly on this issue because year after year there is a record-breaking housing output. People do not want to live on building sites but in completed homes and communities, as they are entitled to do. That is why I commend this Bill and wish it safe and swift passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Gilmore on giving us an opportunity to speak on this issue. Issues around planning and development have been to the fore for many years, not least because of the increased population and housing output. Estates being taken in charge is a frequent source of complaints at public representatives&rsquo; clinics. That has been partially addressed but we often see it in a historical perspective.</P><Col N="708"/>
        <P>All sides must acknowledge that bonding has improved in recent years to the extent that a developer is tied down to complete estates. In the event of someone reneging on a bond and not completing an estate there should be a provision whereby planners and the local council can refuse planning permission to that developer or the new company. Rogue builders have plagued us for many years.</P>
        <P>Development charges must be further explored. Deputy Gilmore debated this at length in committees dealing with previous legislation throughout 2000. A development levy is imposed on a builder to provide for services, footpaths, lighting, civic amenities etc. and is paid to the council.</P>
        <P>It would be more appropriate to levy the developer to provide the services directly instead of putting the money into a slush fund and letting the council debate where it should be spent. It would be cheaper and more efficient if at the start of a development planning permission provided that footpaths to the local village or within the estate, lighting and other civic amenities would be provided.</P>
        <P>Most serious developers building large housing units are becoming professional in their approach. They make large sums of money but would be more amenable to this than to the present process of handing development charges to the local council. When the site is completed the council workers then try to provide footpaths, lighting and other services that the developer would gladly have put in place had it been part of the planning permission.</P>
        <P>We must accept this. In Glanmire there are estates where the developers would gladly have laid footpaths and services for access to the local village. Now, however, council workers with limited manpower resources are trying to do this. It would have been more efficient for that to be a planning condition and it would have been cheaper for the developer and the purchaser. We should examine this because there are many loose ends in that area.</P>
        <P>Another issue that broadens out this debate is Part 5 and what it entails. When developers get planning permission for large housing schemes there should be some mechanism within the planning laws whereby civic amenity areas could be set aside. A portion of the site could be given to the local authority to use in the event of a future demand for a school or health or community centre. That is one of the biggest problems we face. I represent new growth areas and one of these received a grant from the Department of Health and Children seven years ago to provide a health centre. The problem, however, is to find a site, yet developers can come in and build large housing schemes and move on. We must acknowledge this. It would be more appropriate if local authorities provided good developers with <Col N="709"/>planning guidelines, and if development levies were introduced to provide facilities, rather than handing over the money to councils to provide facilities.</P>
        <P>I look forward to Committee Stage so we can highlight some of the areas with which most public representatives have problems. We must recognise that there are rogue developers. Local authorities and planners already have many powers to address the problems relating to bonding and tying developers to completing estates but, more important, planners must be more adventurous in how they approach the provision of services when granting planning permission.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions, which I have noted. I also thank Deputy Gilmore for introducing the Bill. It presents an opportunity to highlight deficiencies relating to planning and development issues within housing estates. It gives Deputies an opportunity to highlight the fact that there are inefficiencies within the system and that non-cooperation in terms of the proper development of estates cannot and will not be tolerated. There are issues within the Bill which must be referred for further legal consultation but this can be addressed on Committee Stage. Last night, the Minister indicated to Deputy Gilmore that he would like his party to examine the legal nuances. These will be worth noting prior to Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>While the completion of housing estates is an extremely important issue, it is just part of the wider question of compliance with planning conditions in general. The introduction of a culture of enforcement is crucial to ensuring the planning control system works properly and for the benefit of the whole community. Lack of planning control enforcement can lead to damage to communities, the environment and our natural and built heritage. It can also lead to an erosion of public confidence and support for the planning system. As is the case for all laws, if people are to respect the planning system, they must be assured that all the conditions will be enforced. If planning law is not enforced, public support for planning systems as a whole will be undermined totally, and we must be very concerned about this.</P>
        <P>We can all point to cases where there have been flagrant breaches of the planning code. At one time planning authorities did not appear to be able to tackle the issue. It was for these reasons that one of the major principles behind the Planning and Development Act was the revision the planning code. This culminated in the Planning and Development Act 2000, which sought to strengthen the enforcement provisions. It is important to look back and see exactly what <Col N="710"/>this meant. In the first instance, the aim was to simplify and reinforce the weapons available to local authorities to effectively address breaches of the planning code and to allow local authorities to catch them at an early stage. It also sought to give incentives to local authorities to take action. Local authorities can now recoup their costs where they pursue developers for breaches of the planning code, and they can keep these fines. It also ensured that people who complained about a breach of the code were responded to and kept informed of the progress of the complaint.</P>
        <P>The Act also introduced significant measures to promote enforcement of planning control throughout the country. Planning authorities are now statutorily advised to take action in response to any unauthorised development they become aware of, whether through complaint from the public or otherwise, unless the development in question is trivial. As can be seen throughout the Act, the planning authority must issue a warning letter within six weeks. It must investigate speedily any unauthorised development. It must make a decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice within 12 weeks if possible and, most important, it must keep the complainant informed of progress. There is a very strong legal framework already in place to deal with enforcement of planning control.</P>
        <P>The enforcement provisions of the Act commenced on 11 March 2002. While it is still very early to establish the impact on the overall level of enforcement activity by the authorities, the 2003 information supplied by the planning authority indicates a 28% increase in the number of notices issued. There is also an increase in the number of notices complied with, which now stands at 24%. There is almost a doubling in the number of convictions from 100 in 2002 to 196 in 2003. In her 2003 annual report, the Ombudsman acknowledged that there appears to have been some improvement in local authority performance in regard to enforcement generally.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to keep the implementation of the enforcement provisions of the 2000 Act under review. Local authorities will for the first time this year report on their performance against 42 service indicators, covering the full range of local government services, including indicators regarding enforcement of planning control. The indicators will allow members of the public and elected representatives to compare the performance of their local authority with all the other local authorities, and how their local authority is performing in terms of its duty. The process is intended to facilitate the identification of good practice and to encourage all local authorities towards improved performance. Issues such as enforcement are regularly raised through formal consultation mechanisms established between the Department and the city and county managers association, the <Col N="711"/>representative body of the managers of the planning authorities. We will continue to press the planning authorities to improve their performance on planning enforcement. An opportunity also exists for members of the various local authorities to examine the progress being made, including the unsatisfactory practice in some local authorities in terms of pursuing developers who do not comply with the planning code, and ensuring that county or city managers ensure compliance with the Act.</P>
        <P>As previously stated, there are significant measures in the 2000 Act to specifically address the issue of completion of housing estates. Planning authorities may now attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of the development. If the development is not completed satisfactorily, the planning authority may use that money as security to have the estate completed. The Act also provides that, where estates have not been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority, and the authority has not taken enforcement proceedings within seven years, the planning authority must take the estate in charge if requested to do so by the majority of residents. This is clearly an incentive for local authorities to ensure estates are completed.</P>

	<P>The failure of the Government and many local authorities to act on this issue is inextricably connected with the detrimental and cosy relationship between the Government parties and developers that has resulted in an unwillingness to take on the greedy and unscrupulous developers.</P>
        <P>Builders and developers regularly fail to complete work in common areas within housing developments, as has been evidenced by everyone who has spoken in this debate. The main problems centre on footpaths and road surfacing, road markings, drainage, landscaping and building rubble being left all over sites when the builders leave. This is a particular problem affecting the commuter belt and the counties surrounding Dublin, such as Louth and Meath, where new housing estates are being hastily built with little care for the quality of life of those who will end up living in these estates.</P>
        <P>I have ample experience of this problem in my own constituency in Louth. A case currently being pursued by one of the Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in County Louth is that of Inis Linn in Dromiskin, a 50 house scheme. Footpaths and proper road structure have not been provided and residents are left to traverse a surface not unlike what one would expect if one were traversing a section of the moon.</P>
        <P>There is also the case of a 35 house scheme at Collon in County Louth where no final surface was put on the road. The most alarming feature of that scheme was the storm drainage system. A <Col N="713"/>system of sorts was put in place but it went nowhere &mdash; there was no provision for the water to escape. Lovely pipes went around the houses in the scheme but they came to a stop and, consequentially, the entire scheme floods every time there is any significant amount of rain. In that case the developer left a bond of &euro;26,000 with the local authority but it cost &euro;33,000 to complete the project. In fairness to Louth County Council, it moved quickly, provided the additional funding and organised the completion of the project because the builder had gone out of business.</P>
        <P>Councillor, soon to be Deputy, Joe Reilly, brought a number of particularly bad cases in County Meath to my attention. Having fought this cause at local authority level for some time, he asked me to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il.</P>

	<P>I do not know what connections Deputy McHugh has with speculators, I will let him answer that. Springfield Glen in Navan is a development of 45 houses and the developer is reported to be in New Zealand. Roads, footpaths and public lighting have all been left incomplete. The developer deposited a bond of &euro;38,000 with the local authority yet conservative estimates suggest that it will cost in excess of &euro;200,000 to complete the scheme.</P>
        <P>Joe Reilly also brought to my attention the case of Rossnaree in Navan, a 100 house scheme where lighting and roads have been left incomplete. The builders were so reckless they welded a fence to a metal ESB cabinet. This dangerous recklessness is found in many developments.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State and the Minister on accepting the Bill. It is an unusual move. I hope that unfortunate people will not continue to be left in these situations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and opportune Bill. It will go a long way to crack down on the problem of unfinished housing developments. The Bill is the perfect remedy to the scandal of unfinished housing developments throughout the country. The developers appear totally indifferent to the concerns of residents, they are not put out by them at all. Thankfully, under the terms of this Bill, local authorities will be empowered to refuse <Col N="714"/>planning permission to developers with bad track records. That is a welcome measure because unless sanctions are imposed, these cowboy developers will not comply with the authorities&rsquo; requirements for completion prior to the estate being taken into the charge of the local authority.</P>
        <P>It would be unfair to give the impression that all builders are the same. There are small numbers who are solely driven by profit and greed. We know who they are, their record is there for all to see. Regrettably, they can face the penalties that can be imposed and they do not deter them from doing the same thing again. They pay the fine and go on because it is well covered by the profit. A key component of this Bill, however, is that the local authority can deny planning permission to the developer who has a bad track record without having to go to court. This is important because if a county council must take on a builder in court, it costs the taxpayer money.</P>
        <P>These developers buy properties in towns and then let them lie there and become derelict. It is a way to bank their money and by doing so they have destroyed many towns across the country. In Counties Cavan and Monaghan, no matter what town a person goes into, there will be five or six derelict houses. The developers have bought them and will let them lie there. It is better than money in the bank because they do not have to pay tax on them. They then get some relief for building on the derelict sites.</P>
        <P>It is also important that infrastructure, such as schools and shops, is put in place for every housing development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I compliment Deputy Gilmore for bringing forward this Bill. It is a no-nonsense practical approach, focused and explicit in nature and devoid of red tape and unnecessary complications. I congratulate Deputy Gilmore for being one of the few Opposition Deputies who has had a legislative proposal adopted by Government, albeit in principle. I also compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for his open and receptive approach to the Bill. It is refreshing to see for once a responsible and mature attitude towards the workings of parliament.</P>
        <P>The idea behind the Bill is so simple that it defies belief that it is not legislation already. It proposes to hit the rogue builders and developers who renege on their responsibilities where it hurts by denying them the benefit of any further planning permission while they remain guilty of leaving estates unfinished. I fully support that principle.</P>
        <P>While the 2000 Act set about dealing with the issue of unfinished estates, the result was too convoluted. It placed a further burden on local authorities that have proved themselves incapable of dealing with the less onerous regime that existed <Col N="715"/>previously. The provision looked good on paper but was useless in reality because local authorities, for various reasons, were not doing the business.</P>
        <P>The Bill before us deals with the position for the future but there are many problems with unfinished estates now. The Minister has accepted the Bill in principle and indicated that amendments will be forthcoming on Committee Stage. I invite the Minister to come forward with a simple enforceable regime to deal with unfinished estates where the developer has, perhaps, gone bankrupt, out of business or has died. If a bond exists it is so small that it is useless.</P>
        <P>A specific time limit must be set down in the grant of a planning permission by which time the estate has to be completed. I am not referring to the life of the planning permission but an obligation placed on the builder to complete and provide such notification as deemed necessary to confirm completion. In the event of the developer not providing such confirmation within the specified timeframe his bond for the satisfactory completion should be confiscated and used to complete the outstanding works immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a good Bill with which I agree. The problem in our neck of the woods is the difficulty in getting started in the first place, never mind to complete what has is already constructed. I am a founding member of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association. I congratulate the Minister on his proposal to make the Irish Rural Dwellers Association a prescribed body so it can nominate people to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I welcome that because An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to reflect the rural point of view, even though it is an independent organisation. Recently, my wife was refused permission for a house by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>There are those who have a vested interest in driving a wedge between environmentally aware groups such as the Green Party and rural dwellers. I spoke here on a debate on planning last year, after which I spoke to Deputy Sargent. The result of that was a meeting today between the Irish Rural Dwellers Association and the Green Party. There are those who are using the once good name of An Taisce in a witch-hunt against rural dwellers. An Taisce is being manipulated into objecting to certain developments in rural Ireland. In particular, it is being set upon like a mad dog on certain bodies for political reasons and is being used and is swallowing the bait, hook, line and sinker. It is being used by blow-ins, casual visitors who when they are lucky enough to get planning permission for a house which they visit twice a year, pull down the drawbridge on anyone else building in the area, including local people.</P><Col N="716"/>
        <P>There is a terrible unfairness and a democratic deficit in the planning system. How is it that community not-for-profit developments are being rejected by planners in favour of totally commercial developments in the same area which enrich developers? Commercial housing developments are getting the go ahead with no objections from anyone. It is time to bring back fairness to the planning system. I have no crib against developers. The crib I have is against the bias towards the developer versus the community.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la is supposed to be independent. It is not independent of Government policy if one looks at its decision on the Ringaskiddy incinerator. That strikes fear into the people of Mayo in regard to Killala. An Bord Plean&aacute;la said it was bound by Government policy on incinerators. Am I missing something here or, is An Bord Plean&aacute;la not as independent as it would like to think?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, dealing with unfinished estates. I welcome and support the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 2 is important. I wish to record my support for residents, home-owners and tenants on this important issue. I have always challenged wildcat developments and developers who leave unfinished estates or do not do their job in a professional manner. It is expensive enough nowadays to buy a home without having to put up with this type of nonsense.</P>
        <P>Many of our citizens and residents have major concerns about planning and development particularly following the tribunals and the corruption of the planning process. These concerns still exist and many feel these revelations are only the tip of the iceberg. I mention this because we, as public representatives, have to be vigilant about sleaze and corruption in politics. It has damaged politics and politicians are constantly getting the wrap on this issue.</P>
        <P>In my constituency I have always challenged wildcat developments in Clontarf, Killester, Artane and Drumcondra. We need houses and developments that are in tune with the local areas and the local environment. For example, I have major concerns about a proposed development at Seapark in Clontarf by Sherborough Enterprises. The 55 new apartments in Seapark along with the apartments in Mount Prospect Lawns and Red Court will lead to a major increase in traffic in Mount Prospect Avenue. This road is already used as a rat-run to escape traffic congestion on Clontarf Road.</P>
        <P>The developer has made no proposals to protect and retain the trees. The seven storey building does not respect the view of neighbouring blocks and will lead to a reduction in natural light. It will also lead to a reduction in recreation facilities. There is concern that it will lead to an <Col N="717"/>excessive reduction of trees which are important landscape features. The building will conflict with the building line on Mount Prospect Avenue. The new buildings do not respect the character of the existing architecture and do not enhance the character of Seapark and the surrounding community.</P>
        <P>I raise these issues to highlight the need for quality and sensible planning and urge all Deputies to support this progressive legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Labour Party&rsquo;s contribution to the planning process in the Bill before the House. It is worthy and the Green Party will certainly recommend that it be approved by the House. It seeks to remove the step of going to the High Court and that is welcome. It will scare the living daylights out of anybody working on a building site given that it targets all persons involved in the direction, management or funding of the project but we have to accept that as a step in the right direction. On that basis it is a worthy Bill.</P>
        <P>To expand the argument, not only do we need to place a greater duty of care on those involved in a building site but we need to revise the building regulations, the planning regulations and provide a decent standard of enforcement of the planning and building regulations. There is a need for better design guidance. We have to ensure a more considered relationship exists between developers and the local authority. I am not talking about councillors, although I could speak at length about elected representatives at local level, but county managers and their staff. That relationship can be perceived as unhealthy.</P>
        <P>For example, advertisements in the local authority yearbooks and diaries are often placed side by side with the contact details for the relevant officials. I note in the frontispiece of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown yearbook and diary that Castle Park Construction Limited wishes D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council continued success in the coming year, as I am sure we all do. The bookmark provided by McGarrell Reilly Homes has been placed with the contact details for the planning and development department. Across the page is an advertisement for Ballygowan Developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not appropriate to the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am using it to aid my argument. I suggest we improve the relationship between the local authority and developers and ensure a clear division. That division arises elsewhere. I have used it before in referring to the glorious testimony of the good days of Fianna F&aacute;il. Dunloe Ewart has taken out the front page advertisement and Treasury Holdings the back page. I suspect that is a little too close to the body politic and that something similar can exist within the local <Col N="718"/>authority. Certainly the developers can get straight in with pre-application consultation in a number of cases and local communities do not have that right. Most local authorities do not keep a record of that pre-application consultation and the names of those who attend those meetings are not placed in a register. I suggest there must be a much clearer and sharper line in the sand drawn between the developers and their lobby groups and the local authority staff and officials. The planning regulations date from 1981 and need to be revised. I am aware that a revision is in hand but after 25 years they date from the age of comely maidens and must be revised to reflect the reality of the 21st century.</P>
        <P>The building regulations should include an increase in energy performance and provide every home with an energy label. Brussels has told us to do so by the end of next year and I do not see any evidence of this happening. The resources must be provided for decent planning enforcement. Lack of enforcement is the reason family and communities are left without lighting on their estates, landscaping and other basic amenities. Better quality must be provided in the 77,000 homes to be built this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JackWall"><NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Deputies O&rsquo;Shea and McCormack.</P>
        <P>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, on bringing this Bill before the House. It is long overdue and any Member active in his or her constituency will be aware of the necessity for it. Over recent weeks I have been canvassing on behalf of Councillor Paddy McNamara, our candidate in Kildare North. With him I visited several unfinished estates with footpaths not properly surfaced, fences not properly constructed and play areas strewn with rubble and skips. These are the problems on new estates but I also cite two older estates, Courtown Park in Kilcock and Castletown in Leixlip. These estates have been built for many years. They are in suburban Kildare and are excellent places in which to live in most respects but, sadly and to the frustration of the residents, many elements of the estates have not been completed and there is no sign of them being completed, despite that they have matured and families have grown up and left the area. As the developer is obviously not going to do so at this stage, the local authority will have to finish the estates to ensure the residents receive the facilities that were promised when Kildare County Council gave planning permission to the developers many years ago.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party wants to put an end to this practice and acknowledges that the Government will not oppose the Second Stage reading. I hope this Bill does not end up in some legislative limbo without advancing to Committee Stage. This would be a very retrograde step which would come back to haunt the Government in later <Col N="719"/>years. It will be of little advantage if it is not proceeded with to Committee Stage to give all Members of the House a further opportunity to develop something that is representative of every constituency. All Members will be aware of incomplete estates within their constituencies where residents suffer accordingly.</P>
        <P>Deputy Gilmore outlined the contents of the Bill which is as simple as it is comprehensive. Under the current Planning and Development Act 2000, a local authority must apply to the High Court for authorisation to refuse planning permission on the grounds of a track record of non-completion. Under the existing legislation, the onus or burden of seeking to refuse planning permission is on the local authority. The Labour Party is of the view that this is unfair. Why should this burden be placed on the local authority which does not always have the time or resources to pursue High Court actions or prevent the grant of planning permission? It should be up to developers to prove they will meet their obligations.</P>
        <P>Most local authorities have an unauthorised development section but that often consists of only one or two officials. It is not feasible or possible to meet the demand. I visited the offices of Kildare County Council recently to speak to an official. There were so many files that it was almost impossible to get into the man&rsquo;s office. It was obvious that this official had little hope of addressing all the matters within the period that would reflect some responsibility by the local authority to the persons who made the complaint in the first place.</P>
        <P>This Bill proposes that where a planning authority forms an opinion that there is a real risk of non-completion by the applicant or the developer and there is a track record of non-completion, it is obliged to serve on the person concerned a notice of its decision to refuse permission for that reason. The notice will take effect within 21 days unless the planning applicant appeals the decision to the High Court. The Labour Party also wants residents who live in or move into unfinished estates to have recourse to the law to seek damages where their estate is left in an unsatisfactory condition. One can see the value put on homes and the cost of housing, particularly in my constituency. Young people must take on high mortgages to ensure they can create a home for their families. They must then suffer because the estate is incomplete. They do not regard the local authority as being in a position to ensure that the estate is completed. I am aware that in Athy, four or five High Court cases were taken in respect of one estate and it is still the same today as it was the first day the local authority went to the High Court.</P>
        <P>This legislation is consumer driven. It places a legal responsibility on construction companies to carry out the work central to the application for <Col N="720"/>planning permission and which is promised to the consumer prior to the sale of the home. It promotes best practice in the industry and seeks to compel all contractors to raise their standards to those equivalent to the best in the industry. It would be preferable if people came together to create a community rather than fighting to ensure the estate is completed. The Bill is designed to ensure the protection of the person who takes out a mortgage and becomes involved in the community. I welcome Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s initiative. I hope the Government will not put the Bill on a shelf to gather dust and that it will be back for Committee Stage before the end of this year.</P>

        <P>I 1999, chuir comhghleacha&iacute; eile de Ph&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre, an Teachta Se&aacute;n Ryan, Bille os comhair na D&aacute;la ag baint le heast&aacute;it tith&iacute;ochta nach raibh cr&iacute;ochnaithe.

        <P>I congratulate the Labour Party spokesperson on the environment, heritage and local government, Deputy Gilmore, not alone for bringing this timely legislation before the House but for securing the position that the Government will not oppose it. This is a tribute to the effective work of Deputy Gilmore in seeking to strengthen the Planning and Development Act 2000 in regard to protecting the rights of citizens in respect of what for many will be the largest investment made in their lifetime.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Unfinished estates reduce the value of the investment of families and individuals who purchase their homes in them. A properly finished housing estate with completed roads, footpaths, public lighting, green areas, road signs and so forth has a pleasant overall effect. We have all encountered cases of people who have moved into new estates in which building work has been completed but many other general features are either neglected or poorly finished.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5-?>
        <P>I recall being asked by residents to view a disused communal septic tank beside a new estate. The tank was a source of grave danger, particularly for children, because its top was open and <Col N="721"/>the deep chamber was filled with filthy water, a health hazard in itself. The more immediate and visible danger was that small children could, without much effort, climb up the part protruding from the ground. If a child had fallen into the chamber of vile water, the chance of him or her being rescued would have been slim. In fairness, as soon as I brought the matter to the attention of the local authority in question, it was rectified. It was incredible, however, that this major hazard had not been attended to, although, thankfully, it did not result in a serious accident or tragedy.</P>
        <P>Deputies will have encountered cases in which the bond sought from a developer was ridiculously small and would not nearly cover the cost of completing outstanding work. We have all witnessed the cat and mouse game which ensues between developer and local authorities. As the former do not want the bond called in, they complete the estate piecemeal to an incremental schedule until it is finally taken in charge by the latter. If, however, a local authority were to call in the bond, it would have serious implications for the financial future of the developer. Equally, it would spell the end of the completion works being carried out by the developer.</P>
        <P>What does Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s Bill propose? It addresses two central issues. Section 35 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables a planning authority to refuse planning permission on track record grounds. Before taking such action, however, it must first apply to the High Court for authorisation. The Bill proposes that local authorities will be obliged to refuse planning permission on track record grounds and places the onus on a developer who wishes to oppose such a decision to go before the High Court within 25 days. The proposal is practical and effective and gives much greater protection to home owners who, in a majority of cases, will have made their largest lifetime investment in a new house.</P>
        <P>The Bill will also contribute to quality of life in two major respects, the aesthetic sense because the surrounding environment will be properly completed and in terms of contentment by eliminating what can often be years of campaigning and agitation on the unfinished development. It places the onus for full conformity with all conditions of the planning permission firmly with the developer. If shoddy work is carried out or work is not completed, the developer will bring about his own dismissal from the pitch. Good conscientious developers have much to gain if cowboy developers do not clean up their acts and are thereby prevented from operating in the future. This must be beneficial.</P>
        <P>The other central issue relates to section 3. It provides for a duty owed by a person granting planning permission which is made subject to conditions requiring the satisfactory completion of the development within a specified period. <Col N="722"/>This duty is also owed by all other persons involved in the direction, management and funding of the development in question and obliges such persons to take all reasonable steps to ensure the satisfactory completion of developments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Gilmore has achieved the unique distinction of being praised by Government, Opposition and Independent Members, I will not heap further praise on him. He was even complimented by two of his constituency colleagues from other parties, a distinction not readily achieved in the House.</P>
        <P>Buying a house is the largest investment most people will ever make. A legislative change such as that proposed in the Bill alerts us to the problem of unfinished estates in our areas. The purpose of the Bill is to amend the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 dealing with unfinished estates. Section 1 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title and collective citation and construction of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 2, which amends the Planning and Development Act by substituting a new section for section 35 on the refusal of planning permission for past failures to comply, is the key feature of the Bill. Under the new section builders who do not complete estates will be punished. As such, the section will significantly reduce or perhaps eliminate the problem.</P>
        <P>The Bill has two effects. First, it shifts the onus of providing that the developer has a good track record on the completion of housing estates from a local authority to a developer and thus gives greater powers to a local authority to combat the problem of unfinished housing estates. Second, it empowers people who move into or live in a new estate to sue the developer of the estate for damages if work has not been completed.</P>
        <P>The problem of unfinished estates is one of the greatest hardships people must contend with and one of the most common problems and sources of frustration brought to the attention of public representatives. The majority of problems concern unfinished footpaths, landscaping, open spaces and other work developers have failed to complete.</P>
        <P>Most new houses on estates are bought by landlords for the rental market or first-time buyers. The former generally live outside the estate and have little interest in anything other than receiving their rent on time and few concerns about whether an estate is completed or has open spaces. Young couples moving into housing estates have enough on their minds as they try to pay their mortgage and decorate and furnish their house. They may be expecting a first child and will not be overly concerned about whether work on the estate has been completed. However, as their children grow older and begin to take an interest in sport and so forth, they tend to look <Col N="723"/>around and ask where is the open space. If they consult the plans or the glossy brochure supplied by the builder when they moved in, they may discover that the area designated as open space is an unofficial dump, as is the case on most estates. They may then find that the builder has progressed to building projects in Dublin, London, Spain, Thailand or elsewhere. In such circumstances, the hard-pressed home owner has no recourse.</P>
        <P>Similar Bills introduced by Deputies Se&aacute;n Ryan and Noonan included the key provision of the Bill before us that local authorities would refuse planning permission to builders who consistently leave unfinished work in housing estates. In their rush to proceed to the next project, builders often fail to complete housing estates and leave roads, footpaths and so forth unfinished. Once houses are sold, the builder has made his profit and while it is legitimate for him to do so, it is also legitimate for those who buy houses from brochures to expect a finished estate. Despite the brochures&rsquo; images of landscaped areas and semi-mature trees, ten years after completion some housing estates have no trees or open spaces. In some cases, house buyers were robbed when they did not get the finished product they were promised. Local authorities too must have control over the houses they commission? Often local authority housing estates are not finished correctly with open spaces left unfinished. Central heating must be installed in all local authority houses. Will the Minister examine local authority housing in this regard and ensure central heating is provided?</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the finishing of housing estates is an important issue, particularly in the greater Dublin area. It often depends on the constituency a Member represents. Powers are in place to deny, with the approval of the courts, planning permission to developers who fail in this regard. Deputy Gilmore wants this process to be speeded up. Careful consideration must be given to some of the proposals in the Bill, particularly section 3. It sets out to impose a duty of care on &ldquo;all persons involved in the direction, management or funding of the development&rdquo;, which are wide terms. The implications of such a proposal for the supply of housing needs must be considered. Under this wording, financial institutions may refuse to give a developer a loan if they are anxious for what they might be held responsible in the future. This wording needs to be teased out.</P>
        <P>The problem the Deputy is attempting to rectify with this provision is partly due to the record rate of housing development. Some developers and builders may move out of an estate quickly <Col N="724"/>as there is so much other work on offer. On Monday I launched the housing output statistics for 2004. The figures were staggering, showing that last year was another record year for output with approximately 77,000 units built. This is up 11.8% on the previous year. We are producing houses at double the 1997 rate. The figures for Dublin were up 17%. In the past ten years, when production of new units took off, the increases were in other parts while Dublin did not keep up with the pace. In the past two years, this has changed and I am glad the number of completions in Dublin stood at 16,800 last year.</P>
        <P>The greater Dublin area saw a 13% increase in housing unit completion. Housing output has increased in all parts of the State, even in counties where one would not expect large development. The lowest figure was 700 new units in one county. These figures are a reflection of the success of the Government&rsquo;s policies and have a positive effect. The construction industry, local authorities and housing co-operatives must be pleased with last year&rsquo;s unprecedented supply of housing units.</P>
        <P>The Bill has many good provisions. While I understand Deputies&rsquo; concerns, and we all experience the problems outlined, the question arises as to how to tie these down and improve matters. On the surface, the Bill&rsquo;s proposals are reasonable, but the issues of funding and directing developments need to be narrowed down.</P>

	<P>I compliment Deputy Gilmore on introducing the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill. It is obvious from contributions to the debate that all sides of the House acknowledge the problem with unfinished estates, particularly in the new growth areas outside Dublin city, such as Kildare, Meath and Louth. I am pleased the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, recognised the Bill&rsquo;s merits and will not oppose its Second Stage reading. Given that the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, voted down a similar Bill in my name on 11 May 1999, the decision not to oppose this Bill could be seen as a cynical move to take the heat off the Government in the forthcoming by-elections in Meath and north Kildare.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Sour grapes. The Deputy is never happy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>However, I am prepared to take the Minister at his word. He will be judged by his actions and not his promises. The Bill, therefore, must not be buried in the list of legislative promises. The Labour Party will demand that Committee and Report Stages be taken in the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s autumn session.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides a mechanism to enable planning authorities to tackle rogue builders and developers who previously failed to properly complete works in new housing estates, or failed to complete them in a reasonable time. This includes the standard of work on the houses, taking charge of the estate, the dedication of open spaces and health and safety standards for construction workers.</P>
        <P>The Irish people&rsquo;s tradition of aspiring to home ownership is unique among EU member states. Over 80% of dwellings in the State are privately owned. To achieve this, couples and single persons are willing to mortgage themselves to the hilt. The average price of a new house in Dublin, for which loans were approved, rose from &euro;92,342 in 1996 to &euro;334,820 in 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>There are also added VAT and other charges.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about affordability, not price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The payments for such loans are astronomical, with little or no alternative for both partners to work outside the home. What should home buyers expect in return for this, the largest investment in their lives? They should expect their houses to be constructed to an acceptable standard, roads to be left in a safe and usable condition, public lighting to be operational and grass verges and open spaces to be planted and maintained so their children can play in safety. Is it any wonder residents are angry when any or all these items, which are normal conditions of a planning permission, have been delayed or, in many cases, deliberately ignored by a small group of unscrupulous builders and developers? Since I became a public representative in 1983, the two main planning issues which have consistently been brought to my attention are indiscriminate rezoning and unfinished estates. At the early stage of my political career, I committed myself to doing something about these issues and I am pleased some of the comments we have made over the years have been taken on board by Government.</P>
        <P>The scandal of unfinished estates is being caused by a minority of builders. Apart from causing grief to the purchasers, they are also giving the building industry in general a bad name. I firmly believe the Construction Industry Feder<Col N="726"/>ation, which was well aware of these problems, should have been more forthright in endeavouring to deal with these people who I would classify as cowboys, some of whom were members of its organisation.</P>
        <P>The former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in voting down my Bill in 1999 indicated that he would address the principal objectives of it in the major planning and development Bill he was preparing. The Planning and Development Act acknowledges and contains some of these objectives but it fell very much short of what was required to deal with the scandal of unfinished estates.</P>
        <P>Last night the Minister, Deputy Roche, referred to the fact that under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the planning authority can refuse to grant planning permissions subject to the consent of the High Court to any developer who has seriously failed to comply with a previous planning permission. The process does not work. The previous Minister in drafting this section of the Act knew very well of its shortcomings in that respect but he proceeded with it, and I wonder why. How many planning authorities have taken the steps provided in the 2000 Act? I cannot recall any local authority going down that road.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Why not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State knows why not. The net effect of section 2 of this Bill enables the planning authority to remove permission subject to an applicant&rsquo;s right to appeal to the High Court. This reverses the current position and, by its nature, puts the onus on the developer to complete the estate rather than go to the courts. I do not accept that this could be construed as an attack on constitutionally protected private property and on the individual&rsquo;s right to earn a living, as outlined by the Minister last night. There is no logic to that argument.</P>
        <P>Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was approved by the Attorney General, no constitutional issue is at stake should a planning authority refuse the permission in accordance with the Act, that is, in accordance with a decision of the High Court. If, as we propose in this Bill, an applicant rather than a planning authority is required to go to the High Court with the same result, how can one be called constitutional and the other unconstitutional? It does not make sense and, as far as I am concerned, it is a cop-out.</P>
        <P>It is about time the rights of householders were given equal consideration to those of developers. This is where we differ with officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department and we make no apologies for saying that. Unfinished estates are a major issue in Meath, Kildare and Fingal. The Minister had better take this on board because the people who <Col N="727"/>have mortgaged themselves up to the hilt are not prepared to stand idly by and they can be assured of the full support of the Labour Party to ensure adequate legislation is enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members on all sides of the House for supporting this Labour Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the purpose of which is to deal effectively with the scourge of unfinished housing estates. I welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Roche, to agree to the Second Stage reading of the Bill and the commitment he made to facilitate early consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage. I noted that he looked forward to the debate. In doing so he has done a service not only to residents living in unfinished estates who are looking to this House for some relief and to the Legislature to change the law so they can get that relief, he has also done a service to Parliament itself because it is good that where there is a problem in the community which requires a change in the law, any Member of this House can propose a legislative measure to deal with it and that a Minister is big enough to accept it and have it referred to a committee. I acknowledge the Bill can be improved and I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>As the debate progressed this evening, I became increasingly nervous about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to have the Bill considered on Committee Stage. I caught some of the caveats entered yesterday by the Minister. I was a bit concerned by the reference of the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, to the need to get additional legal advice on the provisions of the Bill. It is not the best of days for Ministers to talk about referring matters to the Attorney General, particularly when we wonder how long it will take and when the advice might eventually be given. What really concerned me was the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who appears to be so anxious to claim personal credit for the entire 79,000 houses built last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 77,000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State would have us believe he carried the hod for all of them. He almost ended up taking credit and clapping himself on the back for the number of unfinished housing estates. I hope that does not signal reluctance to have the Bill dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>It always interests me that the issue of the constitutional right to property is advanced when the right to property is that of property developers and land speculators. It never seems to get the same airing when we speak about the constitutional right to property of people who pay large sums of money to buy homes. The people who pay for houses in an estate pay to have that estate finished, and their constitutional rights to the <Col N="728"/>property for which they have paid and to the completion of the housing estate which, by extension, is also part of their common property must be vindicated. I doubt very much if the framers of the Constitution had in mind the kind of two-tier view of property rights that seems to be implied in that type of approach. Section 3 of this Bill, which would give to householders legal rights and which would impose duties on developers, emphasises and gives effect to the constitutional right of home owners to the property they buy and the property rights they acquire as a result of the sums of money they pay to purchase their homes.</P>
        <P>I am anxious that the Bill is dealt with in committee as soon as possible. The Labour Party has had a few bad experiences with Private Members&rsquo; Bills which were accepted on Second Stage. A few years ago, I introduced a Bill on electoral matters which was accepted on Second Stage but I could not get it into committee. The Whistleblowers Protection Bill, introduced by my colleague, the Labour Party leader, was accepted on Second Stage but it has still not been taken in committee. I am encouraged by the commitment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government gave yesterday to have the Bill referred to a committee as soon as possible. I thank the House for its agreement to the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this very important issue relating to St. Michael&rsquo;s pre-school in Ennis. The case of St. Michael&rsquo;s pre-school is one worth examining in its own right. What is happening there should be addressed quickly and efficiently. There is more to this. The situation at St. Michael&rsquo;s offers us the chance to address a much wider issue in education, that of integration of children with special needs and the facilities they require.</P><Col N="729"/>
        <P>Let me first set out the facts. Since September St. Michael&rsquo;s has not received referrals for children under seven years of age with special needs. A new model of care has been introduced whereby children aged up to six years with special needs will now be referred to mainstream pre-schools. My understanding from the Health Service Executive is that this is being done without consultation with parents. This is very serious.</P>
        <P>There is no argument regarding the benefits of integrating children with special needs into appropriate mainstream class environments. This issue is being hotly debated in the British media this week. The key word is &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;. The mainstream environment into which children with special needs are being integrated must be appropriate. In the case of St. Michael&rsquo;s pre-school in Ennis, it is not obvious that this is the case, notwithstanding the issue of non-consultation.</P>
        <P>Any new model of care for children with special needs should ensure that their special needs are being met. Children with developmental problems should not be subjected to lengthy and intense therapy sessions in a crowded and noisy environment. They should have the specialised equipment, the nursing care, facilities, such as sensory rooms, and changing facilities they require. What happens if a child aspirates on food or drinks or has a fit? Who will administer their medication?</P>
        <P>I suspect the mainstream privately run pre-schools that it is intended the children with special needs from St. Michael&rsquo;s will attend do not have the required facilities at the moment. Special needs assistants in these schools do an excellent job, but they do not have the training to deal adequately with extreme cases. This is where the new model of care and inappropriate integration breaks down.</P>
        <P>There are 11 children at St. Michael&rsquo;s with special needs. The five staff there allow them to live more independent lives. They are taught feeding, language and speech courses. They have specialist equipment, activity and sensory rooms. The Health Service Executive has issued a statement to the effect that international best practice is to integrate children with disability or with special needs into mainstream environments. The benefits of integration in appropriate environments are not challenged.</P>
        <P>I am simply asking the Health Service Executive and the Minister to think about whether the children are getting the facilities and the education they require; to think about the children in St. Michael&rsquo;s pre-school and about their parents, who think about their children&rsquo;s future all the time; to think about the independent living skills they are being taught; and to think about whether we are doing the right thing for children with special needs or are merely pursuing integration without looking at the appropriateness of the facilities and the environment.</P><Col N="730"/>
        <P>Those campaigning to keep St. Michael&rsquo;s open deserve credit and support. Their case provides an important lesson for the wider educational system. I ask the Minister to think again about these children and their parents. If we are to integrate children into mainstream schools, the schools should be provided with the special equipment that is needed for these special children who, unfortunately, were born with a disability.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue.</P>
        <P>The enhancement of the level of support available to people with disability and their families has been and continues to be one of the priorities of the Government. I am very pleased that both this Government and the previous Government were in a position to make a significant investment in these services in recent years. Since 1997, additional funding amounting to &euro;643 million has been invested in health funded support services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and those with autism. Of this funding &euro;400 million was allocated to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism. The area of services for people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities and those with autism is one of the limited number of areas in which additional revenue funding has been provided by the Government in 2003 and 2004.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matter raised by the Deputy, the Health Service Executive, mid-west area, is developing new early intervention services across the mid west, including County Clare. These services are based on international best practice and are designed to provide appropriate disability related therapeutic interventions to all children with developmental delay. This initiative is fully supported by partnership agencies of the HSE in Clare, namely, Enable Ireland and Brothers of Charity Services.</P>
        <P>Children who require special supports to enable them to attend pre-school in their local areas will be provided with trained pre-school assistants, supported by a clinical multi-disciplinary team that will be involved in the development of individual development plans. The intended impact of this service is to identify special needs in children at the earliest possible age and intervene with specialist supports as early as possible in an effort to minimise the impact of disability or overcome areas of delay before they become exacerbated due to lack of appropriate intervention. The support into pre-school settings also attempts to address the issue of social inclusion for children with disability.</P><Col N="731"/>
        <P>I have been informed by the Health Service Executive that St. Michael&rsquo;s pre-school is run under the auspices of the Clare Federation of the Mentally Handicapped. It is supported by a financial grant from the HSE. Any decision to close the pre-school is a matter for the federation. The HSE grant is secure for the pre-school if it wishes to remain open. All parents who have children in the pre-school have been advised by the HSE that its service will be maintained at current levels until their children start school. A Clare Federation representative is a member of the partnership group that manages the new service development, and meetings or discussions with parents of children at the pre-school have taken place. A further meeting has been arranged to again reassure parents that their service can be maintained if they choose not to opt for the new provision.</P>

	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise the need for the Minister for Health and Children to take urgent action to address the crisis in the provision of services for children with special needs, as highlighted by the Health Service Executive, north-eastern area, in recent days. I also address my remarks to the Minister for Education and Science, who shares responsibility in this area, and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue with the Taoiseach during Leaders&rsquo; Questions this morning and now on the Adjournment because tonight, as we speak, there are parents throughout this land living in fear of what will happen to their children. That is no exaggeration. A very experienced person in the special needs sector in the north-east region told me today that parents who contacted her are &ldquo;absolutely terrified&rdquo;. These are parents of children with autism and other special needs. To quote again this experienced worker in the field, they are &ldquo;terribly frightened&rdquo; by what has happened to the O&rsquo;Hara family in County Meath.</P>
        <P>The Minister is constrained under <i>sub judice</i> rules in what he can say on the case. I am not looking for a detailed reply. However, I emphasise that the crisis for this family has been brought about by the failure of the State to provide the range of services they so desperately need. That failure is replicated in the cases of thousands of others. This family spoke out publicly.</P>
        <P>They stood up for their rights and described their struggle to cope with the needs of four autistic children in a family of five.</P>
        <P>Last Friday the three eldest boys were taken away by the Health Service Executive in the company of garda&iacute; and their parents were not told where they were being taken. They are in bed and breakfast accommodation. The two younger children are in respite care. We need to consider the message this sends out. As I said to the <Col N="732"/>Taoiseach, thousands of families in the State are in fear that if they speak openly about their struggle to cope they could face a similar fate and their children may be taken from them. The report of the task force on autism, published in October 2001, declared that the State was &ldquo;critically unable to meet the needs of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders in Ireland&rdquo;. The case of this family is representative of many others and it shows that nothing has changed substantially since that report was published.</P>
        <P>Three of these children must travel far from their home to access education. The education provision for the others is limited. However, all are denied what they need in terms of speech therapy and occupational therapy. The HSE offers no help in the home for the parents who must cope with the demands of a large young family, a huge task in ordinary circumstances but doubly challenging when children have special needs. I am taking this case as typical of many others. What unites these parents is a determination to do the best for their children, to achieve their rights and to allow the children to fulfil their undoubted potential.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the Government is duty bound to rectify the disgraceful neglect of decades and to provide all these children and their families with the resources they need? Will he pledge here to the parents of children with autism that the State&rsquo;s response will be to provide those services &mdash; educational, therapeutic, respite and support &mdash; and not to heap blame and humiliation on parents who are doing their best to cope against terrible odds?</P>
        <P>One of the most important things the Government can do is not to allow the Disability Bill to pass as it is now constructed. It must commit to recasting it and ensuring that it is rights-based legislation which will give people with special needs and people with disabilities the guarantees they demand so that services can be provided and cannot be withdrawn in future. The task force on autism went even further and called on the Government to pay urgent attention to the need for constitutional reform to ensure clearer provision for people with disabilities, including those with autism. We demand more urgent action on the part of the Government to implement this report fully.</P>
        <P>The lack of priority given to children with autism is shown clearly by the long delay in getting the all-Ireland centre for autism in Middletown, County Armagh, operational. The centre should have been opened and functioning long ago. I do not accept the timeframe the Taoiseach gave in the D&aacute;il this morning. We have waited long enough. Autumn 2006 is far too late. Both the Irish and British Governments must now provide all the necessary additional financial, personnel and other resources required to accelerate delivery of this essential resource. We want to see <Col N="733"/>it open this summer. This is an issue of equity of treatment for all children. We demand nothing less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, I thank the Deputy for raising the matter on the Adjournment and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue. One of the most positive features of the disability services is the strong partnership that now exists between all those involved in the planning and delivery of services. This partnership includes the Government, health boards, voluntary agencies, families and friends, and persons with disabilities themselves. The enhancement of the level of support available to people with disabilities and their families has been and continues to be one of the priorities of the Government. I am pleased that both this Government and the previous one have been in a position to make a significant investment in these services in recent years.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, additional funding amounting to &euro;643 million has been invested in health funded support services for people with intellectual, physical and sensory disabilities and those with autism. Some &euro;400 million of this funding was allocated to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism. Services to people with intellectual, physical or sensory disabilities and those with autism is one of the limited number of areas in which additional revenue funding has been provided by the Government in any Department in 2003 and 2004.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the health-funded services in this sector have advanced greatly in recent years. It is also acknowledged that further work is required in the coming years. To that end I am pleased that the Government was in a position to announce on budget day a special disability multi-annual funding package with a value of close to &euro;900 million over the years 2006 to 2009. This funding is being dedicated now for the period until 2009 to ensure the delivery of these high priority disability services. This package includes guaranteed additional current spending of almost &euro;600 million. The Government has also agreed to allocate &euro;300 million from the revised capital envelope to these high priority disability services.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the new funding package will go to the health sector where it will be invested in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities and mental health services. It will focus, in particular, on the provision of extra residential, respite and day places, extra home support and personal assistance, and extra places in community-based mental health facilities. Of the &euro;70 million announced by the T&aacute;naiste in the Estimates being made available for disability services and mental health services in 2005, some &euro;40 million is being allocated to <Col N="734"/>services for people with intellectual disability and those with autism to enhance these services further.</P>
        <P>With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility under the Child Care Act 1991 for child welfare services. While I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s interest, which is shared by all Members of the House, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of the topic raised by the Deputy given that the Child Care Act 1991 prohibits the identification of children who are the subject of care proceedings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis in the world. Survival of cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland is much worse than in England, Wales and, most significantly, Northern Ireland. As St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin had 304 adult patients on its books at the time of publication of the Pollock report, the situation was reported as being stark. According to Pollock, cystic fibrosis patients and elderly respiratory patients are located &ldquo;cheek by jowl in a tightly constrained space&rdquo;. Segregation from an infection control point of view is difficult and the social mix of young cystic fibrosis patients and elderly patients, some of whom are incontinent, is very unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>A recent letter to me from one of the young adult patients, Simon, identified the following problems:</P>
        <P LI="1">The ward which has been allocated to us is now being used for older men and women who are awaiting beds in Old Folks Homes or hospices. Because of this CF patients are suffering and we cannot get beds. At the moment, [31 January this year] there are three six-bedded rooms for women and one six-bedded and one three-bedded room for men. Out of these twenty-seven beds, older men and women who do not suffer with Cystic Fibrosis are taking up the majority. Some of these patients are on this ward up to one year... There are patients on the transplant list awaiting beds from casualty for a number of days. These patients are prone to the MRSA bug, which is in the hospital. No one is screened for this when they arrive in casualty . . . I am now in to the third week of a severe chest infection and I am reluctant to go back in to hospital, as God only knows what problems will arise. I am regularly admitted to hospital and it is difficult enough having CF without the added grief that I and others are given.</P><Col N="735"/>
        <P FLI="0">I have been told of other incidents where, for example, an elderly patient climbed in to the bed of a cystic fibrosis patient when he went out for a few minutes. The result of this was that much valuable nursing time was taken up sorting out the problem, with beds having to be remade and disinfected and efforts made to prevent the elderly patient causing any other havoc. Many other such incidents have been reported to me by the young adults in the cystic fibrosis wards.</P>
        <P>The Pollock report, published in February this year, made a number of observations that represented a serious indictment of the services and facilities available to cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland. Specifically, Pollock described the current staffing for cystic fibrosis patients as dangerously inadequate. He identified that approximately 40 staff serve the total cystic fibrosis population of 1,143. Based on recognised standards of care this should be 175 staff, which would require an increase of 338%. He also stated that the physical resources fall well below accepted standards, noting that those in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital are particularly poor. This is the largest cystic fibrosis centre in Ireland. The patient profile is one of young adults. That the primary centre for the treatment of young adults with a life-threatening disease can be described in a professional report as &ldquo;seriously inadequate&rdquo; is a disgrace. Furthermore, it is ironic that within 20 yards of the cystic fibrosis ward in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital there is a state-of-the-art extension, completed for more than 18 months and not yet occupied. Will the Minister investigate this and ensure the building is used for the purpose intended so other beds in the hospital may be freed up? Taxpayers&rsquo; money should not be squandered in this way while patients are left in a totally inappropriate environment.</P>
        <P>Beds for cystic fibrosis patients should be in single rooms to avoid cross-infection. Patients should not expect to be left in a six-bed ward with patients suffering from respiratory or other infectious medical conditions. It is the risk of cross-infection which causes greatest concern to these young adults. Identification of the bacteria responsible for infection in cystic fibrosis patients is often complex and cannot be carried out in a routine laboratory. Why is there is no consultant microbiology service, backed up by a reference laboratory attached to the biggest cystic fibrosis centre in the country? As it stands, some samples have to be sent to the UK for identification. This delays treatment, thus further compromising the patient and hindering his or her opportunity for rapid improvement.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister to take account of the recommendations in the Pollock report and to visit the hospital for herself to see the conditions patients and staff must endure. The commitment of the medical, nursing and ancillary staff in the special<Col N="736"/>ist ward is above reproach. They struggle on a daily basis to deliver quality health care to a cross-section of patients with very different medical and nursing needs. However, it is not good enough that young cystic fibrosis patients are compromised because of a failure in our health system.</P>

	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and am delighted to have the opportunity to reply. The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for health services for patients with cystic fibrosis.</P>
        <P>The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned Dr. Ronnie Pollock to review the existing hospital services for persons with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards. Dr. Pollock&rsquo;s review was officially launched earlier this year. It provides an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients and makes a number of recommendations with regard to the numbers and categories of staff appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service. The report concluded that cystic fibrosis care should be provided in fewer units of more significant size so that viable staffing levels can be maintained and to ensure staff have a sufficient workload to enable them to maintain their skills level.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Pollock report, the Health Service Executive met representatives from the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and agreed to the latter&rsquo;s request to establish a working group to consider the report&rsquo;s recommendations. The group, which includes representatives from the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland and the Health Service Executive, as well as relevant clinicians, will review the current configuration and delivery of services to cystic fibrosis patients, in hospitals and in the community, and make recommendations for the improvement and development of services. I understand the group will hold its first meeting in April.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive, which is designated as the national adult cystic fibrosis centre, is pursuing with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital proposals for improvement to the physical infrastructure to support the highly professional treatment and care services provided there.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate on the Adjournment. Urbleshanny national school is located near the growing village of Scotstown in the hinterland of north County Monaghan, which is part <Col N="737"/>of the BMW region. Many planning applications have been lodged for developments in Scotstown and it is likely the population will continue to grow in the future. The baptismal records indicate the significant number of children of pre-school age in the area who will enter the school system shortly.</P>
        <P>Urbleshanny national school is a success story in that pupil numbers have increased to 270 and continue to rise. Last September, the school was allocated an additional teacher to bring its complement to 12. This was a welcome development and indicative of the school&rsquo;s success. However, the regrettable aspect is that there was no classroom to accommodate the new teacher and some of the pupils. There were some good hedges close to the school but such a solution would not do.</P>
        <P>The school management wrote to the Minister in hope, outlining the school&rsquo;s successful situation, the projected further increase in pupil numbers and the allocation of an additional teacher. The management hoped to receive some indication that an extension would be built to cater for its growing population. However, later in the year the bad news came from the Minister that there was regretfully no funding for this project but that the situation would be reviewed in 2005. This gave the school management some little hope and put it off the Department&rsquo;s case for a time.</P>
        <P>However, the school was not included in the listings for 2005. The increasingly frustrated management then set about sourcing a portakabin as a temporary solution to the problem. The parents&rsquo; committee duly collected the required funds for this short-term facility, which has no toilet, cloakroom, running water, either hot or cold, and no fire escape or emergency door. This is not the correct environment in which to attempt to educate children. It is unacceptable that such accommodation must be endured in this day and age. These types of adverse conditions are not beneficial for children and are likely to impede their development and education. Moreover, they undoubtedly have an adverse impact on the morale of teachers. Children quickly realise when a teacher is not firing on all cylinders.</P>
        <P>It is better for teachers, pupils and schools in general when proper classroom conditions are in place. Pupils attend primary school for a finite period of eight years and those years can slip by very quickly. In many schools, pupils are receiving all their primary education in the type of portakabin I have described, with no heat, running water or cloakroom. This is unacceptable, particularly in communities where numbers are increasing.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this issue favourably and to consider the benefits of providing for an extension to the school in the next tranche of funding. Local people are optimistic that <Col N="738"/>the case for the school, which has an excellent reputation, is worthwhile. The roll number for the school is 169230.</P>

        <P>Since the beginning of the year the Department of Education and Science has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on last year&rsquo;s allocation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The programmes supported will include 141 major building projects already on site and a further 28 due to commence in the coming weeks, 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during this year, 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation, up to 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs, 43 schools which have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects and 590 schools which were recently given approval to complete essential small-scale projects under the summer works scheme.</P>
        <P>The new schools building and modernisation programme 2005-09 will be underpinned not only by a significant increase in overall funding but also by major improvements in the administration of the funding. Devolving more funding to local level through the summer works scheme and the small and rural schools initiative will allow schools to move ahead much more quickly with smaller projects while also delivering better value for money.</P>
        <P>Major renovations were completed in Urbleshanny national school a number of years ago at a cost of over &euro;900,000. Since completion of these works, enrolment has increased from 223 when the project was approved in 1998 to 270 pupils in September last year. The Department of Education and Science has received an application from the school authority for the provision of an extension consisting of two mainstream classrooms, a remedial room and an extension to <Col N="739"/>the school&rsquo;s hard play area to cater for the growing enrolment.</P>
        <P>The upward trend in pupil enrolments at the school has necessitated a further examination of the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs to ensure any capital funding being provided is appropriate to meet the school&rsquo;s long-term needs. The assessment of the school&rsquo;s application is ongoing in the school planning section of the Department to determine the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation requirements. The objective is to ensure that whatever additional facilities are put in place at the school this time will serve the needs of the school community well into the <Col N="740"/>future. When this issue is resolved the provision of the appropriate accommodation will be progressed in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the method used by the Department of Education and Science in determining in an open and transparent way how projects are included for funding in the school building programme and to assure the House that this school and all others will be treated in a fair and equitable manner.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the sharp drop that takes place in female participation in sport at senior cycle; the programmes which are in place to increase the participation of women in sport at primary and second level; if her attention has further been drawn to the Title IX funding law in the United States which covers all educational activities including sport; if she will examine the possibility of introducing similar legislation here to level the playing field; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the decline in female participation in sports that seems to occur around the age of 14 years. This situation is not unique to Ireland; it is common internationally. The drop in female participation in PE at leaving certificate level is a source of concern. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children and other bodies such as the National Sports Council, is examining ways to address this. Inter-departmental co-operation is important on this issue given the Department of Health and Children&rsquo;s health promotion function and its role in convincing young women of the benefits of exercise.</P>
        <P>It is important within the curriculum to ensure that sports and physical education is available within all schools. It is government policy to encourage and promote sport for all in schools. The policy of my Department is to facilitate this by means of a broad and balanced physical education curriculum for schools at primary and post-primary levels.</P>
        <P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced physical education programme for pupils and includes six broad strands featuring athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics. Implementation of the PE curriculum in primary schools is <Col N="742"/>being supported by an in-service training programme for teachers over 2004/5 and 2005/6.</P>
        <P>Second level schools should offer a physical education programme based on an approved syllabus with teaching hours registered on the school timetable. The time recommended for physical education is two hours per week. The phasing in of a revised syllabus for physical education at junior cycle began in September 2003. The syllabi both at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, schools in Ireland have a strong tradition of developing sport outside the school timetable, and sports organisations such as the GAA, FAI, Basketball Ireland, the Irish Sports Council and local sports partnerships provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>Title IX is a United States federal law that requires almost all elementary, secondary schools, colleges and universities to provide equitable educational opportunities to male and female students, including within their sports programmes. Within Ireland, the Equality Act 2004 and the Equal Status Act 2000 guarantee that individuals will not be discriminated against on account of their gender. Educational institutions are obliged to comply with the terms of those Acts. I do not consider that additional legislation is required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>Initial advice on the reform of the senior cycle was submitted by the NCCA to my Department in June 2004 and it indicated that a further advice would be submitted early in 2005 setting out the configuration of subjects, short courses and options, and the assessment and implementation implications of the proposals. That second advice, which will enable my Department to assess the resource and operational implications of the proposals, has not yet been received.</P><Col N="743"/>
        <P>The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage a re-structured senior cycle curriculum consisting of transition units, short courses and subjects. The option of a two or three year cycle would be retained and the leaving certificate applied programme would continue as a discrete programme. All pupils, including LCA pupils, would follow at least one transition unit and many pupils would take a greater number.</P>
        <P>The proposals provide also for an increased emphasis on a wider range of modes of assessment such as practical/portfolio/project work and with more frequent assessment events. However, as with the present system, assessment will continue to be predominantly on the basis of examinations which are externally set and externally marked. This is in keeping with international trends in high stakes examinations.</P>
        <P>Overall the proposals set out a long-term vision for fundamental reform in senior cycle provision which will have significant policy, resource, professional development, staffing, assessment, equipment and infrastructural implications for the education system into the future. These issues must all be explored thoroughly before a decision on implementation can be made. The receipt of the NCCA&rsquo;s second advice, which is not expected to be finalised until after Easter, is an important step in that process of analysis, and detailed costings of resource implications have not been prepared by my Department in the interim.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the issues which emerged in the NCCA&rsquo;s public consultation process and research on the future of senior cycle in Ireland, and of the continuing dialogue which is being undertaken through the NCCA&rsquo;s collaborative structures in finalising the second stage of its advice to me. I look forward to receiving that advice at an early date and to giving it careful and thorough consideration.</P>
        <P>We must ensure that, as our education system continues to evolve in the knowledge society, reforms build on the existing strengths of the system while addressing its weaknesses. We need reforms that are designed to ensure that our system has integrity, relevance and quality for all our students, including those that are currently served well and those whose needs are not being as well met at present. It is important to ensure that any reform of senior cycle, first, preserves confidence in the system and maintains the strengths of the existing leaving certificate in terms of objectivity, integrity and public and employer confidence and, second, achieves the right balance between structured and independent learning for students.</P>

        <Quest>if, in view of the higher than anticipated number of teachers retiring in 2004, she will give an impact report on services, particularly <Col N="744"/>class sizes and the pupil/teacher ratio following these retirements.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Each year my Department decides on the number of places to be provided on the teacher training programmes, both in respect of school leavers and postgraduate applicants, in the colleges of education, having regard to the projected demand for qualified primary teachers. Among the factors which are taken into account in arriving at the decision is the projected number of retirements.</P>
        <P>In 2004, a large number of teachers retired. While teachers generally do not have to indicate the reason for retirement, it appears that the main reason for the substantial increase in numbers in 2004 was that many teachers, who might have otherwise retired in 2003, remained in service to benefit in retirement lump sums from the substantial pay increases due for payment in 2004. A repeat of these higher numbers retiring is not anticipated in the current year.</P>
        <P>The total intake to the colleges of education has more than doubled since 1995/96, from 500 students in 1995/96 to 1,280 students this year. In addition, graduates of the new primary teacher training course, which is being accredited by HETAC and delivered by Hibernia College, an online third level educational company, will be recognised for the purposes of primary teaching.</P>
        <P>The substantial increase in the number of newly trained teachers coming out of the training colleges in recent years has ensured that in addition to replacing retiring teachers, enough newly qualified teachers have been available to achieve significant reductions in the pupil teacher ratio and in class sizes. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996/97. The pupil teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996/97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003/04. Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs.</P>
        <P>Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break/ Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>

        <Quest>if she is in discussion with any private companies with regard to the provision of new school buildings; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>As a general point, both my Depart<Col N="745"/>ment and the Office of Public Works, which acts on my Department&rsquo;s behalf in site acquisitions, may deal with private companies in the acquisition of land. With regard to those building projects where the Minister is formally the client, as distinct from the school board of management, my Department engages directly with firms for architectural, engineering and quantity surveying services and the awarding of construction contracts. However, the school management authority is the client in the vast majority of school building projects as schools are not typically owned by the State.</P>
        <P>From time to time officials in my Department&rsquo;s planning and building unit receive proposals generally through schools, but occasionally directly, from private companies regarding the provision of either sites for schools or new school buildings. These proposals are typically from developers who may also be in discussions with local authorities regarding applications for planning permission for housing developments. There are a number of such proposals at various stages of discussion at present. However, none of these discussions is finalised and for reasons of commercial sensitivity I am not in a position to elaborate further at this point.</P>
        <P>I can say, however, that most of these proposals involve funding from the State. In considering such proposals my Department first assesses whether they provide value for money for the taxpayer. This is done by way of benchmarking the cost of the proposal against standard costings for new schools or sites as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Two other key issues also arise in considering such proposals. The first relates to the priority of the school building project and the band rating assigned to it in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s published criteria. Proposals that involve projects with a high band rating receive priority treatment by my Department compared to those with a lower band rating. The second issue is that any proposal must fully comply with public procurement requirements. The procurement rules ensure that State funded projects must be delivered in a transparent way that ensures an open and fair tender competition. Furthermore, the successful contractor must comply with tax, insurance and other requirements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has been investing heavily in our higher education system and in our third level research infrastructure. An amount of &euro;671.6 million has been allocated to the university sector for 2005. This is an increase of over &euro;41 <Col N="746"/>million or approximately 7% on the 2004 outturn for the sector. The additional funding being provided in 2005 marks a return to the significant upward trend in recurrent funding for the sector and will assist in meeting pay and other cost pressures. It is a matter for each institution to manage its affairs prudently using the funding allocated to it.</P>
        <P>The overall provision by my Department to the third level sector, capital and recurrent, will amount to approximately &euro;1.6 billion in funding in 2005. In 1997, when this Government took office, the amount of funding provided to the third level sector was approximately &euro;850 million. The funding being provided in 2005 represents an increase of approximately &euro;750 million or 88% on the 1997 provision.</P>
        <P>The OECD review of Irish higher education highlighted the key role of the sector for our future social and economic development. This echoes the report of the Government enterprise strategy group, which states that Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, and the social dividends that flow from that, will depend to a large degree on knowledge and innovation. Supporting our higher education institutions in playing that central role is a major policy priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>I have recently met with the heads of universities as part of my consultations on the priorities for moving forward with the implementation of the OECD report. In recognising the importance of a vibrant higher education sector for our future national objectives, I am committed to continuing to work closely with university leadership in advancing progress.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also note that there is a 29% increase in third level research funding as part of the 2005 Estimates. This is evidence of my personal, and indeed the Government&rsquo;s, commitment to research programmes, which play a vital role in developing world class capabilities in research and innovation and give the higher education institutions the necessary resources to meet the challenges of the knowledge society in Ireland.</P>

	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent <Col N="747"/>resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and make special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; it will automatically adjust a school&rsquo;s general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced. For this reason I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting with representative interests, including the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>With regard to resources for children in the lower incidence disability categories next year, resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications. It is important that where there is a particular special need in the low incidence category that these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the special education needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, provided a capital envelope of &euro;555 million in respect of education PPPs for the period 2005 to 2009 and I am currently examining how this may <Col N="748"/>be best utilised. A key rationale underpinning the decision to proceed with the initial bundle of five schools was to test the PPP approach in the case of schools, to learn from the experience and thereby to inform future usage of a PPP approach to procuring schools.</P>
        <P>Based on the experience to date, a number of issues are under active consideration by my Department and will inform my decision on the allocation of the funds available to me for PPP development. These include the type of PPP model to be used, the level of operation and service to be included in any new programme, how the projects should be bundled so as to provide the most cost effective procurement and the size and geographical spread of the bundles. New building projects on greenfield sites that have been prioritised using the criteria agreed with the education partners, and published by my Department, fit the PPP model best as distinct from projects that involve modernisation of existing buildings. I intend to announce my plans for a further PPP programme in the near future.</P>
        <P>One of the attractions of PPPs is speed of delivery. The total time required to procure the five schools using the PPP approach was approximately three and a half years. Under the traditional approach to the procurement of new schools, the comparable elapsed time typically averages four to five years. One of the most striking aspects of the Department&rsquo;s PPP programme to date is the high quality of design and materials. It is clear from the proposals that Jarvis has &ldquo;spent to save&rdquo;. By investing up front in quality design and construction, the cost of ongoing maintenance over the 25 year contract can be significantly reduced.</P>

	<P>My Department has not made a specific financial allocation to primary schools towards the purchase of literacy testing documentation in the period in question. However, my Department&rsquo;s scheme of capitation grants gives schools discretion to purchase materials in accordance with their needs and funds provided under this scheme may be used for the purchase of literacy testing documentation as required. The capitation grant has been increased by 27% to &euro;133.58 in that period.</P>
        <P>At present, there are no requirements for schools to carry out literacy tests. However, it is estimated that over 90% of primary schools administer standardised tests in English and mathematics to some classes each year.

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s White Paper on adult education, &ldquo;Learning for Life&rdquo;, identified the need for targeted interventions so as to encourage and support the participation of certain priority groups in adult education. In particular, the White Paper highlighted the allocation of additional resources to address adult literacy needs and the need to provide increased opportunities for adult learners, prioritising the needs of those with less than upper secondary education.</P>
        <P>These opportunities are provided by my Department through the availability of a range of second chance education programmes for young people and adults alike who have either left school early or who need further vocational training to enhance their employment prospects. These programmes are provided mainly by the vocational education committees but also in schools and colleges and by community based education groups. The programmes supported by my Department are complemented by a range of courses provided by F&Aacute;S and other education and training providers.</P>
        <P>Expenditure on further and adult education will rise to approximately &euro;138 million in 2005, representing an increase of &euro;10 million, or nearly 8%, over the provision for 2004. It will provide for an expansion of existing services in the sector in the coming year. A further sum of more than &euro;50 million will be expended on staff salaries in VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller training centres. The increases provided in the 2005 Estimates include an additional &euro;2.5 million for adult literacy. Indeed, expenditure on adult literacy programmes has increased 18 fold since 1997.</P>

	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs and in recent years significant additional resources have been made available to schools to enable them to provide for children with such needs.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system: more than 2,600 resource teachers; more than 1,500 learning support teachers; more than 1,000 teachers in special schools; more than 600 teachers in special classes; nearly 6,000 special needs assistants; more than &euro;30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; more than &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials.</P>
        <P>In addition, the level of resources being made available by my Department to support students with special educational needs in the second level system has also grown significantly in recent years. In the current school year to date, my Department has allocated approximately 1,387 whole-time equivalent teachers and approximately 628 special needs assistants to second level schools and VECs to cater for the special educational needs of students at second level. The establishment of the National Council for Special Education is a further major step in ensuring that the requirements of children with special educational needs are identified and the necessary resources put in place in a timely and effective manner.</P>

	<P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available at present. However, the National Economic and Social Forum report of 2002 on early school leaving cited, as a broad estimate, that around 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis. There is some doubt attaching to this estimated figure of 1,000, which may be an over statement of the true position at this stage.</P>
        <P>My Department is currently engaged in analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database. This is a significant and complex project which will, in time, facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates.</P>
        <P>My Department operates a number of programmes at both primary and post-primary level to tackle the problem of early school leaving. The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving. A key role in this regard is also played by the home/school/community liaison, HSCL, scheme, which was extended to each of the 312 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also addresses issues in the community impinging on learning and educational participation.</P>
        <P>The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department&rsquo;s strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects &mdash; 300 primary and 112 post primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</P><Col N="754"/>
        <P>Both the HSCL scheme and all 82 school completion programme projects operate transfer programmes which are very important in assisting pupils in making the transition from primary to post-primary level. The Education Welfare Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare focused services to children, families and schools. The board currently has an authorised staffing complement of 94.</P>

	<P>Reading literacy achievement in primary schools is measured using standardised reading tests. Children&rsquo;s achievement scores on these tests are expressed in percentiles from 1 to 99. Those who score at or below the tenth percentile are generally regarded as having serious literacy difficulties and would be given additional supports in school, such as learning support teaching.</P>
        <P>At second level, the Programme for International Student Achievement, PISA, survey of 15 year olds conducted in 2000 categorised achievement at five levels of proficiency.

In Ireland, only 3.1% of children were in this category, well below the OECD average of 6%, while 7.9% of Irish students scored at Level 1, compared to an OECD average of 11.9%.

	<P>My Department is aware of the concerns which have been raised about young people&rsquo;s behaviour with alcohol and drugs. For most young people, it is the misuse of substances &mdash; particularly alcohol &mdash; which is the greatest threat to their physical and emotional health and to their well being. As a consequence, students&rsquo; engagement with their studies can be seriously affected. While education has a role to play in addressing the problem, behavioural change will not happen without the support and co-operation of parents, the drinks industry and society as a whole.</P>

Parents have a responsibility to help children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol. The community as a whole needs to reflect on the general attitude to alcohol use.</P>
        <P>Schools can also play an active role in addressing the problems and consequences of the misuse of alcohol and drugs through the SPHE &mdash; social, personal and health education &mdash; curriculum which focuses on developing an informed and sensible attitude to substances. Through the SPHE curriculum, students are given the skills and information to develop a framework for responsible and informed decision making about <Col N="756"/>their health, personal lives and social development. In particular, the substance use module of the SPHE curriculum focuses on the issues relating to the use and misuse of a range of substances, with particular attention paid to alcohol and tobacco. While most young people are aware of the implications and consequences of misusing substances, including alcohol, the SPHE curriculum actively seeks to promote healthy and responsible choices by students in their lives.</P>
        <P>All post-primary schools were required to implement the SPHE curriculum as part of the junior cycle core curriculum from September 2003. The 2003-04 return of pupil information from 743 post-primary schools indicates full compliance with this requirement. Ongoing support in the implementation of SPHE continues to be provided to schools through the post-primary SPHE support service. Supports are also being provided to schools through the SPHE support service for the development of substance use policies within which the use and misuse of alcohol and drugs can be addressed.</P>
        <P>Under the national drugs strategy, my Department and the Department of Health and Children developed guidelines, in co-operation with the former health boards, to assist schools in the formulation of a drugs policy and to ensure that all schools had drugs policies in place. My Department issued the guidelines in booklet form to all schools following an extensive process of consultation that included management bodies, teacher unions, student unions and parents&rsquo; councils.</P>
        <P>The central objective of a school&rsquo;s substance use policy is the welfare, care and protection of every young person in line with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The policy is intended to address education concerning alcohol, tobacco and drugs and the procedures for managing incidents relating to these substances.</P>

	<P>The Government decided last July that my Department should finalise contractual negotiations with Jarvis Projects Limited with the view to commencing construction of the Cork School of Music as soon as practical. Shortly thereafter Jarvis Plc, preferred bidder for the CSM project, announced a profit warning on the London Stock Exchange. To help solve its financial difficulties the company commenced selling off non-core elements of the company. One of the areas to be disposed of was the PPP bidding business that included the CSM project. On 3 December 2004, Jarvis announced that it had reached an agree<Col N="757"/>ment with Hochtief Developments (UK) Ltd to purchase this arm of the business.</P>
        <P>Following the announcement, various issues surrounding the purchase were being completed and a revised proposal and documentation in connection with the CSM PPP project were received on 19 January 2005. As Hochtief has now replaced Jarvis as a member of the bidding consortium, it must satisfy the Department that had it applied under the terms of the original PPP advertised in 2000 it would have been one of the consortia that pre-qualified for the project. The new documentation is currently being examined by my Department&rsquo;s specialist advisers to the project who are also undertaking full financial and legal due diligence to ensure that the proposal meets all EU procurement guidelines. Part of the due diligence process includes contact with the relevant section of the EU Commission for clarification and advice on the procurement issue.</P>
        <P>It is expected that this examination will be completed and a report submitted to my Department&rsquo;s public private partnership unit for consideration shortly. Subject to all of the necessary financial and legal issues being in order, it will then be possible to commence formal negotiations with Hochtief Developments to complete the contract details to allow financial and commercial close for the project take place.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>The terms of the Government decision of February 1999 to establish the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, allowed for the number of psychologists in the educational system to increase gradually to 200. It was envisaged that approximately 180 psychologists would be in NEPS and the balance elsewhere, for example, in the VECs of the city and county of Dublin and in the children detention schools. The complement of psychologists in NEPS has increased almost three fold from 43 psychologists on the date of establishment to 127 psychologists now.</P>
        <P>The last panel of 69 psychologists established by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners has now been exhausted and arrangements for the recently established Public Appointments Service to set up a new panel are at a preliminary stage. I am aware that, at <Col N="758"/>present, some regions have higher numbers of psychologists and a more satisfactory coverage of schools than others. This is related to the difficulty in recruiting staff to certain regions, most notably the mid-western region.</P>
        <P>When the next recruitment competition for NEPS psychologists takes place, regional panels, rather than one national panel, will be established. This will allow my Department to prioritise filling vacancies in regions with the greatest need. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS will depend on the availability of resources and must also take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>
        <P>Pending the expansion of NEPS to cover all schools, those that are not yet served may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA. The SCPA is an interim measure and was specifically introduced to minimise delays for those children who need to be assessed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was set up under statute in 2002 to provide financial redress to victims of child abuse in State regulated residential institutions with the aim of assisting them in their recovery and enhancing the quality of the remainder of their lives. The board provides an alternative to victims having to pursue traumatic civil court cases to obtain compensation for their injuries.</P>
        <P>To date, some 5,500 applications have been made to the redress board and awards amounting to approximately &euro;210 million have been paid in over 2,600 cases. While the average award based on applications to date is &euro;78,000, it is not valid or appropriate to compare this with any individual award, particularly the one referred to by the Deputy which was considered to be an exceptional case. The amount of award payable by the board in each case will depend on the severity of the abuse and the severity of physical and psychological injury as well as loss of opportunity resulting from the abuse. The board may grant awards up to &euro;300,000 and, in exceptionally severe cases, it may award an amount higher than <Col N="759"/>this. There is also provision to award additional aggravated damages of up to &euro;60,000 in certain specified circumstances.</P>
        <P>The redress scheme provides an effective and fair way for compensating victims of abuse who do not wish or are not able to pursue their cases through the full rigours of the courts. While people have the right to bring their cases to court, the Government is of the view that the redress scheme provides the best and most practical option for victims of abuse seeking financial redress for the injury and suffering they have experienced.</P>
        <P>The redress board has several advantages over the court route. The proceedings of the board are generally much faster than those in court, so victims obtain their redress sooner. There is a much lower burden of proof than in a court of law and unlike the courts, the redress board is not an adversarial process so going to the board is far less traumatic for victims. I am satisfied that the redress board is working well and in the best interests of survivors and I do not see a need to carry out a review of the board or to propose amendments to the Act in the light of the recent court judgment.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the findings of a recent EU survey by Eurydice, which found that Ireland is behind the rest of the EU in the teaching of foreign languages in schools in that 95.5% of primary school children here learn no foreign language; the way in which she proposes to address the issues raised in the survey; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to recall the context in which children in many European countries learn foreign languages. Many countries, for example, Belgium, Luxembourg and Finland, have a significant historic presence of other languages within their borders or in close proximity. This has created an imperative within those countries to learn those foreign languages. In other regards, far and away the most popular foreign language in European schools is English.</P>
        <P>Language development is a central element of the revised primary curriculum. Although the focus is on English and Irish, a number of primary schools also offer foreign languages. My Department launched a pilot project for modern languages in primary schools in September 1998. The aims of the pilot project included the development of communication skills in four target languages, which are French, German, Spanish and Italian, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in schools. To achieve these aims in the project schools, the teaching of a modern European language to pupils in 5th and 6th <Col N="760"/>classes was introduced. Currently, 394 schools are participating in the initiative at primary level.</P>
        <P>My Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe to facilitate the analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. This analysis will include the development of criteria for decision making on issues such as the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum. This will complement ongoing work by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, which is engaged in reviewing languages in the post-primary curriculum and the feasibility of expanding provision at primary level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many primary schools have a general purposes room for play and PE facilities during inclement weather. In addition, practically all schools have play areas which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. A similar situation with sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. Many schools have the use of adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields and swimming pools.</P>
        <P>The provision of multi-purpose space for primary schools will continue to be considered within the design brief for new schools and-or renovation and extension school building projects. This will also be the case for PE facilities at second level. This will be done in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects. My Department has never underestimated the scale of the task and the level of capital funding and other resources required to rectify decades of under investment in school infrastructure. In 2005, &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building and modernisation works, which represents an increase of 14% on last year and is six times greater than the amount allocated in 1997.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 112 together.</P>
        <P>It is assumed that the Deputies are referring to the position at primary level. The pupil-teacher ratio as published in my Department&rsquo;s annual statistical report is calculated by dividing the total enrolment in all primary schools by the total number of full-time teaching posts. The total enrolment includes all children in ordinary and special schools and the total teaching posts include administrative principals, learning support teachers and recognised teachers of pupils with special needs in ordinary primary schools as well as teachers in special schools.</P>
        <P>The national pupil-teacher ratio is an indicator of the ratio of overall full-time staff to pupils at primary level. Since it takes account of all teachers in a school, including resource teachers, it has limitations in giving an accurate picture of the size of classes. To provide a more accurate picture of the size of classes, my Department also publishes details of average class size in the annual statistical reports. This indicator includes mainstream class teachers only and refers to ordinary pupils in ordinary classes. The average class size indicator provides a more accurate picture of the size of classes at primary level. However, since this indicator takes account only of mainstream classroom teachers, the growth in the number of resource teachers and teachers other than classroom teachers at primary level is not captured by this indicator. These are included in the calculation of pupil-teacher ratio. Therefore, while both indicators have their limitations, they are complementary.</P>
        <P>The Deputies should note that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the <Col N="762"/>1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break/ Breaking the Cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, the position will be further improved in the future within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

        <P>At primary level it is a matter for each local authority to provide a library service for schools in its area. While my Department has no involvement in the actual operation of this service, it makes a grant available to each local authority on an annual basis to enable local authority librarians select, purchase and deliver books to the primary schools in its area. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each local authority area.</P>
        <P>The Estimates provision in respect of library grants has been increased from &euro;1.5 million in 2004 to &euro;2.026 million in 2005, an increase of<?oasys _jy?>35%. The question of increasing the grant in the future will be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

In recent years two grants, amounting to some &euro;6.60 million, have issued to second level schools in the free education scheme to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. Schools were informed that the grants were to be used to improve the range and quality of library books and an information note offering advice on book purchases was issued.</P>

	<P>A cross-governmental working group was established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit run by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among its recommendations was the proposal that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children explore the possibility of developing an employment history register, similar to the PECS system in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>An implementation group has been established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children are ongoing in that context. Although considerable preparatory work examining the issues relating to a PECS system has been undertaken by my Department, these discussions are at an early stage. In addition, my Department will be convening a meeting with the relevant interested parties to explore the issues involved.</P>
        <P>The implementation group is also examining issues relating to the introduction of legislation to ensure the maintenance of a national criminal records system within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the disclosure of not just &ldquo;hard&rdquo; facts but also &ldquo;softer&rdquo; information, and access to information about &mdash; and proof of &mdash; criminal convictions for the purposes of litigation.</P>
        <P>The working group also recognised the need to expand the number of agencies which could access the central vetting unit operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to include all people working with children and vulnerable adults. To that end, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided to the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with children and vulnerable adults. The initiative includes more than doubling staff resources for the unit to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>The Teaching Council also has a role here. Once it is formally established, the council will <Col N="765"/>provide the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to self regulate and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and, if necessary, removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.</P>

	<P>My Department considers the issue of bullying in schools as a priority for action and is fully supportive of any measures which address this issue. In this regard, my Department is actively engaged in a number of activities and its &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in schools&rdquo; provide a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school based policies to counter bullying.</P>
        <P>These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school manage<Col N="767"/>ment, teachers and parents. The purpose of the guidelines is to assist schools in devising school based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. They are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>My Department funded the development of the Trinity College Dublin anti-bullying training programme for teachers-schools, including the piloting of the programme in Donegal Education Centre. The programme was based on the Norwegian experience of preventing and countering bullying behaviour. Following completion of the pilot, a meeting was held in spring 2003 to discuss the Donegal pilot, which was very general in nature and focused on future proposals in overall terms. Subsequently, a request was made by Dr. Mona O&rsquo;Moore, Professor of Education, TCD, to fund a video on the programme. At that juncture, it was considered that this was not appropriate in terms of existing provision, other priorities, competing demands and available resources.</P>
        <P>On her own initiative, Dr. O&rsquo;Moore set up a programme based on the Donegal pilot to be delivered to all schools during school time. However, there was no contact between Trinity College and this Department regarding requests for funding or the implications of school closures to facilitate this programme. At a far later stage, a request was made to my Department about school closures and related financial support shortly before the programme was planned to commence. As my Department had no prior knowledge of the proposed programme, details were sought to examine the resource implications and the potential impact on schools through closures.</P>
        <P>The request was made well into the current school year when timetables are firmly established in schools and it was, therefore, not possible to accommodate the request without a significant degree of disruption to teaching given the inadequate notice. Moreover, a paucity of information was provided on the resources required for the programme and, coupled with the lateness of the proposal, it was considered inappropriate to support the programme at that stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the serious problem of youth suicide and of the vital role that schools can play in prevention. Prevention needs to be <Col N="768"/>addressed at whole school level through provision of relevant curricula for all children, through effective implementation of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme, and through the provision of care afforded by a good pastoral system, including the capacity to respond appropriately to early signs of difficulty. The development of self esteem, general coping skills and personal effectiveness is the most appropriate way to help the general population of young people to deal with life pressures and stress.</P>
        <P>Within the curriculum, SPHE provides for the development of personal and social skills, including self awareness, respect for others, self esteem and communication skills, which can play an important role in encouraging a positive self image. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>At second level the key emphasis is on promoting self esteem, physical and mental-emotional well being, and responsible decision making. Self management, communications, physical and emotional health, coping with loss, handling conflict, substance abuse, personal safety, relationships and sexuality are covered. Implementation of SPHE in schools is assisted by a full time support service which operates on an integrated basis in collaboration between the Department of Education and Science and the former health boards.</P>
        <P>A curriculum in SPHE is being developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for senior cycle students. Mental health is one of five key areas which will be addressed in the new syllabus. An optional module in mental health matters is among the programmes included by many schools as part of their transition year programme. In addition, exploring masculinities, which may be taken as part of the SPHE programme in schools in transition year or senior cycle, includes many topics designed to assist young males to become more open when experiencing personal problems and to seek professional help.</P>
        <P>Pastoral care teams in schools provide important assistance in promoting students&rsquo; well being and in ensuring that potential difficulties can be identified early. Class year tutors, guidance counsellors, home school liaison co-ordinators and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, can play an important role in this respect. NEPS has developed an advice and information pack for schools on responding to critical incidents. The pack is designed to provide practical step by step guidance for teachers and principals on how to respond when a trauma or tragedy occurs. The pack was prepared drawing on a range of publications and from the work of a range of agencies, including those concerned with bereavement and suicide.</P>
        <P>My Department is represented on a national steering group which is preparing a national strategy for action on suicide prevention.</P>

	<P>Differing funding arrangements have evolved for the different school types at second level. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. There are, however, significant differences in the approaches to the funding of back-up services such as for secretaries and caretakers. In my view, it is important to consider any changes in the allocation of funding in the wider context of the equalisation of funding arrangements across the second level system. This Government and its predecessor have removed some of the anomalies and the process continues.</P><Col N="770"/>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years, to &euro;286 per pupil in 2005. In addition to this, a number of new grants, such as the school services support grant, have also been introduced. I was particularly pleased to announce an aggregate increase of &euro;26 per pupil from 1 January 2005 in the standard <i>per capita</i> grant and support services grant for voluntary secondary schools.</P>
        <P>This significant increase builds on my commitment towards enhanced &ldquo;equalisation&rdquo; funding measures for voluntary secondary schools. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools has been increased by an additional &euro;42 per pupil, bringing the overall grant to &euro;145 per pupil with effect from January 2005. This equalisation measure for voluntary secondary schools, that is paid in addition to grants of up to &euro;15,554 per school, is designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Schools have considerable discretion as to how this funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils and schools. This is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items.</P>
        <P>I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity highlighted by the voluntary school sector.</P>

	<P>The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. The aims of Early Start are to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Early Start is a one year, pre-school intervention aimed at children from selected designated areas of disadvantage. Children must be between the ages of three and four years on 1 September of the year they are enrolled. The Early Start project is designed to cater for the needs of children, including those with disabilities, who are most at risk of not reaching their potential in the education system and the school must give priority to the children who are most at risk. This would also include children at risk from migrant, refugee and asylum seeker families.</P>
        <P>There are 56 teachers and 56 child care workers employed in 16 full units and 24 half units and there are a total of 1,680 places in Early Start centres. A full unit caters for a total of 60 children and a half unit caters for 30. The approach taken in Early Start is to establish groups of 15 pupils in existing primary schools in disadvantaged areas, with each class being run by a primary school teacher and a qualified child care worker. While the Early Start curriculum emphasises the development of cognitive and language skills, due regard is also had to personal and social development.</P>
        <P>Parental involvement is a key element in the Early Start project. Parents are encouraged to become involved in the planning, organisation and implementation of the work in each centre. This is intended to build their own capacity to influence and become involved in their children&rsquo;s education. Post-primary students from local schools may also spend part of their time working in the centres as part of their work experience during transition year and-or Yourthreach and vocational preparation and training programmes. This will allow them to acquire practical skills in child care and will also establish role models in retention and achievement in education in the local community.</P>
        <P>The Early Start service has not been expanded since 1995. With regard to future development of early childhood education provision for disadvantaged children, my Department, as part of a detailed review of educational disadvantage programmes, is currently exploring how such provision should best be delivered in the future. I am particularly concerned to ensure that any future actions by my Department in this area are based on a collaborative approach with other Departments involved in the overall early childhood care <Col N="772"/>and education, ECCE, sector. Meeting the overall objective of providing the best possible service to the communities and children involved requires that any educational provision by my Department takes account of child care measures under the remit of other Departments.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 101, 127 and 128 together.</P>
        <P>The OECD review of Irish higher education makes far reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector, against a background of the crucial role that has been identified for higher education in achieving Ireland&rsquo;s broad strategic objective of becoming a world leading knowledge based economy. The report identified a continuing need for an independent policy advisory and funding authority for the sector and recommended the creation of a tertiary education authority which would have responsibility for both the university and institute of technology sectors. I have already indicated my agreement in principle that such a single body offers the best way of ensuring a unified strategic and management approach for the sector.</P>
        <P>I am currently engaged in an extensive consultation process, aimed at developing a comprehensive response to this and other recommendations of the OECD report. As part of this, I met recently with representatives of the Conference of Heads of Irish Universities, the Council of Directors of Institutes of Technology, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Higher Education Authority. It was apparent that there were many points of consensus between all parties in their response to the report and this is very encouraging. It was agreed that further detailed consultation on certain issues is required. It will also be necessary to meet with a range of other stakeholders as part of the consultation process. I intend to bring forward proposals for reform of higher education, including legislative proposals where necessary, at the earliest possible date.</P>

	<P>I have not met with representatives of groups concerned with sexual violence in my capacity as Minister for Education and Science. As regards dealing with the issue within education, a national curriculum in social, personal and health education, SPHE, incorporating relationships and sexuality education, has been developed at junior cycle level and this has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003.</P>
        <P>In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for junior cycle and senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An <Col N="774"/>integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed. The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</P>
        <P>The SPHE modules at junior cycle in post-primary schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy. The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and includes pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault and accepting sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>A national SPHE support service was established in September 2000 and provides a full-time support service in collaboration with the health boards to assist schools to deliver the programme. A national support officer for RSE is also provided in St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, Drumcondra, to provide support and advice to schools in regard to RSE at senior cycle.</P>
        <P>SPHE programmes are designed to enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives. The curriculum guidelines in RSE at senior cycle will be reviewed as part of emerging developments in the review of senior cycle and the development of an integrated SPHE programme incorporating RSE. My Department is also undertaking research, in the context of the national strategy on crisis pregnancy, to examine how best the implementation of SPHE and RSE in schools can be further strengthened.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under statute in 2002 to provide a mechanism for people who were victims of childhood abuse while in residential institutional care to obtain financial compensation for their injuries as an alternative to having to pursue their cases through the courts. The Government&rsquo;s decision to establish the redress scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations who managed the institutions would participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>Nonetheless, as it was considered desirable that the religious congregations make a meaningful contribution towards the compensation of victims of abuse, the Government entered into negotiations with the congregations which culminated in agreement being reached in June 2002 on a total contribution by the congregations of &euro;128 million. The &euro;128 million contribution was made up of a cash provision of &euro;41.14 million, real property transfers totalling &euro;76.86 million and a &euro;10 million provision for counselling and support services for victims of abuse.</P><Col N="776"/>
        <P>In return for the congregations&rsquo; contribution, the Government agreed to grant them an indemnity for a period of six years from 5 June 2002, the date of the signing of the agreement. The indemnity applies to cases that are eligible to be processed by the redress board but where the plaintiff decides not to avail of this option and pursues his or her case through the courts. In these circumstances the State will take over the defence of the case.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the agreement reached with the religious congregations represented the best possible outcome in the circumstances. It was made abundantly clear to the State&rsquo;s negotiating team that the &euro;128 million contribution was the maximum the congregations were prepared to offer. The alternative option of rejecting the offer and pursuing the congregations through the courts would have resulted in a very large number of protracted legal proceedings with the involvement of victims in an adversarial process, with substantial costs in legal fees and no guarantee of a favourable outcome.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>During the summer of 2004, the board undertook a survey on the levels of school attendance for the school year 2003-04. This is the first time that data on school attendance at national level have been collected. The findings of the survey support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, one of the functions of the board is to conduct and commission research into the reasons for non-attendance on the part of students and into the strategies and programmes designed to prevent it. The board is in the process of establishing two research projects in 2005, one of which will focus on an analysis of student absenteeism returns. Pending receipt of the reports from the board in due course, my Department has no plans to amend the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</P>

	<P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. At second level, while physical education is not a mandatory subject, it should form part of the curriculum. The programme that each school plans and delivers should be based on the Department&rsquo;s approved syllabi and the teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable. The time recommended for physical education is two hours per week. The phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education, non-examination, commenced in September 2003.</P>
        <P>The syllabi both at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school.</P>

	<P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</P>
        <P>The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for <Col N="778"/>individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; it will automatically adjust a school&rsquo;s general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced. For this reason I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting with representative interests, including the National Council for Special Education.</P>
        <P>With regard to resources for children in the lower incidence disability categories next year, resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications. It is important that where there is a particular special need in the low incidence category that these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education and the special education needs organisers will greatly enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>

	<P>Early education in Ireland covers the period from birth to six years. Almost all five year olds and half of four year olds attend junior infant and senior infant classes in primary schools. Provision for children below the age of four years is targeted at specific groups. Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early childhood education encompasses pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, for Traveller children and for those with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk during 1994 and 1995. There are a total of 1,680 places in early start centres. A review of educational disadvantage programmes is currently being finalised by my Department and the future development of early childhood education provision for disadvantaged children, including Early Start, is being considered in this context. I hope to announce the outcome of this review shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department also supports 48 Traveller pre-schools. These schools aim to develop children&rsquo;s cognitive, language and social skills, to prepare children for entry to primary school and to provide a foundation for further learning. In the special needs sector, there are currently 12 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition to this, eight stand alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment, on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>The bulk of pre-school places in the country are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years. The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to child care groups, including to community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>

	<P>My Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue of bullying, including homophobic bullying, which I regard as a very serious issue. A central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum is the education of students in anti-bullying behaviour. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. In addition, other programmes such as civic social and political education, relationship and sexuality education and the exploring masculinities programme address diversity and equality from different perspectives, including sexual orientation.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. My Department has provided <?oasys _ch?>&ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Schools&rdquo; to assist schools in developing this policy. In addition, my Department has part funded an advice booklet for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people which has been distributed to guidance counsellors together with appropriate guidelines for its use.</P>
        <P>My Department is also funding two specific projects dealing with this issue. These are HIV-AIDS education, sexuality education and homophobia in Irish second level schools and a review of the exploring masculinities programme. The outcomes of these projects will greatly assist the development of policy in this area and will be carefully examined in my Department.</P>

	<P>My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment. This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the <Col N="781"/>Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry.</P>
        <P>Important progress is being made in regard to curricular reform and in-service support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology, physics and chemistry. Revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science began in schools in 2003/04 and work is under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national in-service programmes for teachers.</P>
        <P>The junior certificate revised syllabus, with its hands-on investigate approach requiring the completion of 30 mandatory experiments, will be particularly important in encouraging more pupils to continue science in senior cycle. For 2004-05 the revised syllabus in junior certificate science is mandatory in all schools except those which have been given a derogation on the basis of having inadequate facilities. Only three schools applied for a derogation. Every effort will be made to bring their facilities to the required level by September 2005.</P>
        <P>Resourcing provides an additional <i>per capita</i> grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment; and the implementation of a once-off grant scheme to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus. A sum of &euro;16 million has been invested in school laboratory facilities in 2004, through equipment grants linked to the introduction of the revised JC science syllabus and targeted refurbishment of schools labs most in need.</P>
        <P>Important progress is also being made in ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative and the TV scope programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; and awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools and the launch of the new &ldquo;Discover Science and Engineering&rdquo; programme in October 2003 bringing together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy.</P>

	<P>The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties being experienced were aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career breaks and job sharing schemes. It is important to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years. Since 1999, over 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the bachelor of education programmes in the colleges of education.</P>
        <P>Since the 1995-96 academic year, an 18-month postgraduate course has been provided in the colleges of education. The total intake to the colleges of education in the current academic year is approximately 1,280 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently approximately 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. In addition, graduates of the new primary teacher training course which is being accredited by HETAC and delivered by Hibernia College, an on-line third level educational company, is recognised for the purposes of primary teaching.</P>
        <P>In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. Bachelor of education graduates of St. Mary&rsquo;s College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications are now recognised as fully qualified. Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers. They are permitted to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools. The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the need to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the recent media report mentioned by the Deputy that indicated an over-supply of science teachers. I am sure the Deputy is aware that the teacher supply and demand issue at second level is very complex. Analyses undertaken by my Department in the past indicated that there are regional and subject variations. A further complicating factor is that vacancies in second level schools usually require specific subject combinations.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for teacher education and development, with particular regard to initial teacher education covering the colleges of education and the education departments in the universities and colleges. There are a number of different courses of study available within these institutions which lead to a qualification in the teaching of science at second level, including the higher diploma in education in the universities, the concurrent bachelor of education courses at St. Catherine&rsquo;s College and St. Angela&rsquo;s College and the concurrent courses at a number of universities and colleges. My Department has a role in regulating the numbers of students entering both the bachelor of education programmes in St. Catherine&rsquo;s College and St. Angela&rsquo;s College and also on the higher diploma in education courses.</P>
        <P>With regard to the higher diploma in education, in cases of clearly identified shortages or over-supply in specific subject areas, my Department can introduce a subject specific quota which can, in time, increase or reduce numbers of teachers and address over or under-supply. In the case of the concurrent model in the universities and colleges, my Department has a role in the provision of funding on an individual basis through the Higher Education Authority. However, it is a matter for the individual institutions to decide on the number of places available on the concurrent courses in a manner similar to decisions taken on the annual intake for any particular course of study. My Department does not and cannot have a direct role in the regulation of the overall number of people who opt to pursue a particular qualification in these institutions, whether in science teaching or another non-teaching field of study. My Department and the HEA are continuing to review the supply and demand of second-level teachers on an ongoing basis. The issue of science teachers will be one of the areas which will be given attention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very conscious that schools across the country have to deal with a heavy administrative burden arising from necessary departmental and legislative requirements. I have indicated recently to a number of parties my intention to conduct a review of this administrative burden as soon as possible. I am happy to report that my Department will shortly write to the relevant stakeholders inviting them to consider where and in what way present processes can be improved upon. As well as consulting with interested parties, the process will look at internal procedures and ways in which we in the Department can streamline our business processes to deliver benefits to principals in schools. Increased use of IT systems and more effective communication between the Department, agencies and schools are just some of the ways that we are hoping to reduce the burden on schools.</P>
        <P>We can collectively identify practical opportunities to streamline our processes, while still achieving our key objectives. I look forward to working with my officials and interested parties on addressing this issue on an ongoing basis.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy refers to the number of places approved annually for post leaving certificate courses. In the 2004-05 academic year, approximately 28,500 places were approved. The approval process for PLC places for the academic year 2005-06 will take account of enrolment trends, applications from VECs, schools and colleges for course approval and the totality of demands for courses and teaching resources across the system.</P>

	<P>The Higher Education Authority introduced a quota of Irish and non-Irish entrants to <Col N="785"/>first year medical programmes, with effect from the 1980-81 academic year. The agreed figures were 305 Irish and 28 non-Irish. Following a Government decision in 1987, it was agreed that the intake of foreign students &mdash; non-nationals of EU member states &mdash; in the university medical schools should be increased to maximum extent possible with effect from the 1987-88 academic year. The figures for the new entrants to the medical schools in Ireland for the 2003-04 academic year can be seen in the following table.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor and the Minister for Health and Children established a working group on undergraduate medical education and training to review the organisation and delivery of medical training and education in Ireland. The group has presented interim recom<Col N="786"/>mendations for significant reform of the entry mechanism to medical education. The recommendations include the introduction of a multi-streamed model of entry to medicine, comprising undergraduate and graduate entry methods, with leaving certificate performance no longer the sole selection method for entry at undergraduate level. I anticipate that the full report of the working group on undergraduate medical education and training will become available by mid-2005. It is my intention to consider the broad range of recommendations that are expected in tandem with my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. The question of increasing the numbers of medical places in line with projected health service requirements will be progressed in this context.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of children availing of school transport services in a school year varies from time to time. Accordingly, the figures below are averages of pupils availing of the service within the years mentioned. Between 8,000 and 9,000 children with special needs currently avail of the transport service and these are included in the overall figures. In 1999, the figure was 145,000 and in 2004 it was 140,000. Total expenditure for each of the years in question was &euro;57.978 million in 1999 and &euro;109.845 million in 2004.</P>
        <P>In addition to rising fuel and insurance costs, a major contributory factor to the increase in transport costs in recent years has been the provision of improved transport facilities for children with special needs. The most recent figures available indicate that 30% of the budget is being expended on transport and grants for children <Col N="786"/>with special needs who represent about 6% of the overall number of children carried. The cost of employing escorts for children with special needs has increased significantly in line with the growth in that service. The payments made in 2004 include an increase in the hourly rate of pay plus a once-off lump sum payment.</P>

	<P>The general process of assessing and planning for the need for additional provision at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing and other developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places. My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or <Col N="787"/>proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course, meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision.</P>
        <P>Officials in the school planning section of my Department are strengthening contacts with local authorities to enable informed decisions to be made in planning future educational provision. For example, a specific forum, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by officials of my Department, interacts with the Dublin local authorities. The forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin and those of the patron bodies of primary schools. It works proactively to monitor demographic changes and their likely impact. Over and above this, as the Deputy will be aware, a new area based approach to school planning is being pursued by my Department. This involves a public consultation process and published area development plans which form a blueprint for school development in an area in a ten-year period. All of these measures, taken in combination, will enable us to build on the progress made to date and plan and respond ever more effectively to emerging need.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations of the task force on autism provide an invaluable basis for the development of educational services and supports for persons with autism. However, in responding to the recommendations, my Department has had to give priority to a number of key areas before detailed individual recommendations can be addressed. The key areas involve the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures required to underpin service development and delivery.</P>
        <P>This approach is critical to the implementation of many of the individual recommendations of the task force including those relating to assessment, parental involvement, service delivery, information dissemination, promotion of inclusion and co-ordination between health and education authorities. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has been enacted, while on the structural front, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established on a statutory basis. These developments represent significant progress and I am confident they will have a positive impact on services for children with special educational needs, including those with autism.</P>
        <P>The issue of the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the task force continues to receive detailed consideration within my Department. However, my Department has already acted on many of the recommendations of the task force and is continuing to develop the network of special educational provision for children with autism. The extent of progress can be measured with reference to the fact that, since 1998, when autism was first recognised as a distinct special educational need, a number of dedicated facilities have been developed.</P>
        <P>In the course of development, 141 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools have been created; ten pre-school classes for children with autism established; eight autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism are being funded and five special classes for children with Asperger's syndrome have been created. My Department sanc<Col N="789"/>tions home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home based applied behavioural analysis programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the task force on autism put forward a range of important recommendations in the area of continuing professional development. My Department continues to address these recommendations on a phased basis through existing supports, newly established structures and specific interventions. Developments worthy of note include the establishment of the special education support service in September 2003, the provision by the Department on an annual basis for 140 places on a postgraduate diploma programme in special educational needs and 20 places on a postgraduate programme in autism. The Department also funded the development of an applied behaviour analysis training programme in Trinity College, Dublin, and funded the participation of 12 teachers on the course in 2003-04. The successful participants are now available to the Department as classroom teachers and a further training resource.</P>
        <P>The role of the special education support service is to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The service is hosted in Laois Education Centre and is funded by my Department. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the special education support service has established teams of trainers to deliver training in post-primary level. Training is delivered locally across the State through the education centre network. In addition, the service provides immediate responses to requests from schools for support in a variety of autism-related areas.</P>
        <P>The service also funds the provision of on-line training courses, including a course on autism, during the summer months of July and August and during the autumn and spring terms. The service funds approved approaches to the teaching of children with autism such as picture exchange communication system, known as PECCS, and treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, known as TEACCH, and the Hanen approach.</P>
        <P>Another major landmark in the development of autism specific services was the launch last September of the Middletown Centre for Autism in County Armagh. This marked the successful completion of the purchase of the former St. Joseph&rsquo;s Adolescent Centre, Middletown, on behalf of the Department of Education in the North and the Department of Education and Science in the South. Both Departments plan to refurbish the property to meet the needs of a centre of excellence for children and young <Col N="790"/>people with autism throughout the island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The centre will be dedicated to improving and enriching the educational opportunities of children and young people with autistic spectrum disorders. I am satisfied that the steps taken in recent years and those in hand represent significant progress in the development of services for children with autism. However, I fully recognise that further progress is required and my Department in consultation with parents and existing service providers will seek to ensure the recent rate of development is maintained.</P>

	<P>My Department is considering the results of recent revisions to projections of future enrolment in the light of demographic and social changes as well as the publication, by the CSO, of new population projections in December 2004. As the Deputy will appreciate, uncertainties arise in regard to future migration trends, participation at various levels of education and long-term trends in births. Nevertheless, it is important to move ahead and plan for the continuing increase in enrolments at primary level, which will eventually feed into second level, as well as the need to increase completion flows from further and higher education in the light of long-term economic and social needs. Following consideration of the likely resource and policy implications of the revised projections, I plan to make the latest projection publicly available before the end of the current school year.</P>

	<P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at risk groups. A total of five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Staff have been deployed <Col N="791"/>in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Educational welfare officers have been appointed in 13 towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>In response to a request from the board, my Department approved the recruitment of an additional ten staff in November 2004 to meet identified needs. Decisions relating to the assignment of the additional staff to specific areas are a matter for the board which is an independent statutory agency. My Department has asked the board to convey details directly to the Deputy of the number of educational welfare officers in each county.</P>

	<P>The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level which was released in August 2003, indicates that <Col N="792"/>for the 1994 cohort of students, the adjusted senior cycle retention rate is 81.8%. My Department&rsquo;s approach to addressing the issue of retention in schools comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as interventions to prevent early school leaving. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. With regard to curriculum reform, my Department&rsquo;s strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>

	<P>The educational psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service do not keep waiting lists of children requiring assessment in the sense of lists of names that are dealt with in chronological order. School authorities refer children for assessment and discuss the relative urgency of each case during the psychologists&rsquo; visits. An overall account of current waiting lists, as requested by the Deputy, is not available to NEPS as this information is held by the schools.</P>
        <P>In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows the psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>NEPS is being developed on a phased basis over a number of years. Pending expansion of its service to all schools in the country, my Department has allocated funding to NEPS to allow for the commissioning of psychological assessments from private practitioners.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
        <P>In 1999, the Secretary General in my Department assigned responsibilities to assistant secretaries, under section 9 of the Public Service Management Act, for overseeing the management of their divisions in line with the outputs specified in their business plans and the resources allocated to them or under their control. Under these assignments, assistant secretaries are responsible for advising on, monitoring and implementing policy, and overseeing the delivery of quality services in respect of their divisions.</P>
        <P>The Secretary General subsequently assigned responsibility for financial management matters, as envisaged in section 9(1)(<i>e</i>) of the Act, to assistant secretaries and principal officers, in the context of further strengthening the internal financial control systems within the Department. Further assignments in regard to staff management matters, as envisaged in section 9(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Act, will be considered once legislation to amend the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 has been enacted, at which time revisions to the original assignments are also planned to reflect changes in personnel and re-assignments of functions at assistant secretary level.</P>
        <P>The assignment of functions under the Act forms part of more extensive management arrangements to support the discharge of the Department&rsquo;s business, including; preparation of the three-year strategy statement and annual progress reports; a programme of business planning reviews undertaken by the management advisory committee in respect of each division; target setting and annual review for each assistant secretary; and the performance management and development system, PMDS, under which responsibility for the delivery of the outputs in the business plans is assigned at individual and team level across all grades in the Department.</P><Col N="795"/>
        <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
        <P>While the Department&rsquo;s strategy statements, which outline the objectives and strategies being pursued by the Department and the indicators against which progress will be measured, and annual reports, which report progress on the implementation of the strategy statements, are published, it has not been the practice to publish assignments of responsibility, divisional business plans or the role profiles of individual staff members.</P>
        <P>In the normal course of discharge of the business of the Department, I, like my predecessors, delegate responsibilities to my Ministers of State and officials. Some of these are undertaken under implied delegation of authority, while others are delegated under, and in accordance with the provisions of, the relevant legislation, for example, under the Statistics Act, responsibility for the Central Statistics Office is delegated to the Government Chief Whip, under the Civil Service Regulation Act, responsibility for certain staff management matters is delegated to officials in the Department and so forth. Any question arising in regard to such implied delegation of authority is a matter for legal interpretation by the courts.</P>
        <P>I believe that the above arrangements for the delegation and assignment of functions within my Department are the appropriate ones, having regard to its size and remit.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 139 together.</P>
        <P>The national steering committee on violence against women was established following the report of the task force on violence against women in 1997. Its purpose is to provide a multidisciplinary, multi-agency and cohesive response to the problem of violence against women and it is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>My Department does not directly fund or co-ordinate health and personal social services to victims of abuse. Moneys are made available each year, formerly through the health boards, and now through the Health Service Executive, for the provision of services to women victims of violence. In recent years there has been a substantial increase in funding so that now over &euro;12 million is provided annually for the provision of such services. The distribution of this funding is now a matter for the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I have asked my Department, together with the Health Service Executive, to undertake an analysis of the current level of service provision in this area with a view to planning future service needs.</P>

	<P>The smoke free workplaces measures apply, with limited exceptions, to all enclosed places of work. The exemptions are specified in the Public Health (Tobacco) (Amendment) Act 2004 and where a hospital, as referred to by the Deputy, meets the requirements so specified an exemption will apply. A decision to allow the smoking of tobacco products in exempted premises is a matter for the management of the premises concerned. However, the fact that a premises is exempted does not confer a right to smoke in that location and neither does it affect the duty of care an employer has in respect of his or her employees.</P>

        <P FLI="0">As can be seen from the figures shown, there were varying levels of funding in each of the former health boards and the ERHA areas. The variations reflect a number of factors which, to different degrees, impact on service provision of former boards. Such factors include, the presence of national and regional specialties, the effect of case mix outcomes in respect of acute hospital performance, the instances of patient transfer between former boards and demographic factors.</P>
        <P>From 2005 onwards, a new vote, Vote 40, contains the voted funding for the Health Service Executive, which now has the responsibility for delivering health and personal social services. It will be a matter for the executive and its management to determine how best to fund the different service directorates going forward.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Avian influenza, or bird flu, is an infectious disease of animals caused by viruses that normally affect only birds. While all bird species are thought to be susceptible to infection with avian influenza, domestic poultry flocks are especially vulnerable to infections that can rapidly reach epidemic proportions. There have been a number of outbreaks in poultry in Asia since late 2003.</P>
        <P>In 1997, avian influenza A, H5N1, was responsible for 18 cases of severe respiratory disease and six deaths in humans in Hong Kong. Prior to this outbreak, H5N1 was not known to infect humans. It is now recognised that highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks pose a significant threat to human health, with H5N1 infections in humans causing severe illness and having a high case fatality rate.</P>
        <P>In January 2004, Thailand and Vietnam reported their first human cases of H5N1 avian influenza infection. According to the World Health Organisation, WHO, there were 55 laboratory confirmed cases in Thailand, Vietnam <Col N="802"/>and Cambodia between January 2004 and 2 February 2005, of which 42 were fatal. Four new cases of human infection were announced by the Ministry of Health in Vietnam on 7 March 2005. The WHO has confirmed that there is no evidence of efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission.</P>
        <P>The greatest concern for human health is that the avian influenza, H5N1, virus will remain endemic in Asia and that continued transmission of the virus to humans and other animals will provide opportunities for human and avian viruses to exchange genes, reassortment, to produce a virus that can replicate in humans, is highly pathogenic and is easily transmissible between humans. In a human population with no pre-existing immunity, such a virus could trigger a global influenza pandemic.</P>
        <P>An influenza pandemic would have very serious effects in terms of mortality and morbidity; services such as acute hospitals and general practice would experience greatly increased workloads, well in excess of those seen during more regular outbreaks of influenza. Medical experts consider that another influenza pandemic will occur; however, it is impossible to predict when it will occur. The ongoing outbreaks of avian influenza in Asia highlight the need for vigilance and preparedness.</P>
        <P>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, plays a key role in relation to the prevention and management of infectious diseases, including influenza, in this country. The Irish approach to infectious diseases outbreaks is based on sound internationally accepted principles such as: preventative measures; early identification of cases; effective clinical care, including good hospital infection control; appropriate surveillance; and contract tracing and management of contacts.</P>
        <P>The HPSC monitors the avian influenza situation in Asia on an ongoing basis through the World Health Organisation. There are no restrictions on travel to any country currently experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 avian infection in poultry flocks, including countries, which have also reported cases in humans. However, in line with advice from the WHO, it is recommended that Irish travellers to areas experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza infection should avoid contact with live animal markets and poultry farms. In addition, the following actions have been undertaken: interim Irish guidelines on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza, influenza A/H5, have been circulated to all health care professionals and are also posted on the HPSC website. Guidance in the form of a SARS and avian influenza clinical management algorithm has been circulated to hospitals and clinicians on the appropriate management of travellers with an influenza-like illness who have returned from east or south-east Asia, that is, areas where avian influenza outbreaks are occur<Col N="803"/>ring. This will assist in early detection of any influenza A/H5 cases.</P>
        <P>The overall aims of pandemic influenza preparedness planning are to reduce morbidity and mortality, and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects.</P>
        <P>The influenza pandemic expert group is reviewing and updating Ireland&rsquo;s 2002 influenza pandemic preparedness plan. Once finalised the updated plan will be published. The 2002 plan was based on the World Health Organisation, WHO, blueprint for an influenza pandemic plan published in 1999. It addresses a range of issues including prevention strategies, scientific and medical issues, and communications. The WHO plan is currently being updated to incorporate new scientific data and experience obtained during recent outbreaks. Our pandemic plan will be modified in line with these recommendations once they are agreed and published by the World Health Organisation.</P>
        <P>Vaccination is the principal measure for preventing influenza and reducing the impact of epidemics. It will be the primary public health intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. However, the production of a vaccine tailored to a pandemic influenza strain could take six to nine months. Developments are under way at international level seeking to expedite this process.</P>
        <P>Pending the availability of virus specific vaccines, antiviral drugs will be the only influenza specific medical intervention available for use in a pandemic. Antivirals can be used for prophylaxis prevention and for treatment. The Government has agreed that antiviral drugs should be stockpiled. The expert group has reviewed recommendations for the use of antivirals in line with international guidance and I am now considering its advice. It is anticipated that procurement arrangements will be initiated within the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>A national antiviral stockpile would be used to treat priority groups. Prioritisation is essential if both morbidity and mortality are to be reduced, and essential services are to be maintained thereby minimising as far as possible the disruption to society which might result from a pandemic. The priority groups include, for example, individuals who are hospitalised with influenza, people who may be more vulnerable to the virus, and key workers in essential services.</P>
        <P>It should be noted, however, that pandemic planning is a dynamic process and the definition of risk is likely to change over time. This means that the recommendations for use of antivirals must be kept under review. In particular, the expert group will need to review the epidemiological data before final recommendations are decided in the setting of an imminent pandemic. The decision-making process will be guided at all <Col N="804"/>times by relevant expert advice from the European Commission and the World Health Organisation.</P>

	<P>The assignment of functions under the Public Service Management Act 1997 was first made by the then Secretary General of the Department of 1 January 1999, covering all individuals at assistant secretary grade. While the frameworks to date have contained assignment in respect of named individuals, they also include a generic statement of responsibilities for the assistant secretary grade, as well as for the overall management of divisions. All frameworks to date are available internally.</P>
        <P>The assignment of functions under the Public Service Management Act 1997 forms part of a deep and extensive management structure which supports the discharge of the business of the Department. These structures include: the performance management and development system, including an individual role profile and twice yearly review for all officers; preparation of a three year statement of strategy and annual business plans for the Department; formal monitoring by the management advisory committee of the implementation of business plans; target setting and annual review for each assistant secretary; network of principal officers and equivalents and assistant principal officers and equivalents whose function is to contribute to the development of policy in key areas.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 152 of today&rsquo;s date, there is a deep and extensive management structure in my Department which supports the discharge of the business of the department and the assignment and delegation of functions. These structures include: preparation of a three-year statement of strategy and annual business plans for the Department; a performance management and review system, including individual role profile and twice yearly review for all officers; formal monitoring by the management advisory committee of the implementation of business plans; target setting and annual review for each assistant secretary; network of principal officers and equivalents and assistant principal officers and equivalents whose function is to contribute to the development of policy in key areas.</P>
        <P>In the normal course of discharge of business by the Department, a number of functions are undertaken under implied delegation of authority from the Minister. Any legal challenge arising in regard to such implied delegation of authority is a matter for legal interpretation by the courts.</P>
        <P>In addition to the Public Service Management Act 1997, there are a number of other legislative provisions under which particular matters have been delegated in my Department. In the case of some, details are made available publicly, such as the details of the Department&rsquo;s arrangements for the making of initial decisions and internal review under the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 to 2003, where details have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In other cases, such as the nomination of certain post holders as suspending authorities in cases of grave misconduct, the details are not published.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the management system in my Department and the procedures for the delegation of functions are working well, and are kept under review.</P>

	<P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and the Public Service Management Act 1997, set out clearly the legal position of Government Ministers and Departments. Section 3 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 restates the responsibility of Ministers for the performance of functions which are assigned to their Department. Section 2(1) of the Act of 1924 provides that each Minister shall be a corporation sole and shall have perpetual succession and an official seal, and may sue and be sued, and may acquire, hold and dispose of land for the purposes of the functions, powers or duties of the Department of State of which she or he is head or of any branch thereof. Contracts and all other legal rights or liabilities are, therefore, either entered into, accepted or enjoyed in the name of the Minister or on behalf of the Minister.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 to 169, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Following a Government decision in April 2000, the post mortem inquiry was established to investigate post mortem practice and procedure in all hospitals in the State since 1970. The terms of reference include the issue of the retention by hospitals of pituitary glands. Neither I nor my Department has been advised that any hospital has failed to co-operate with the inquiry.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in September last that the inquiry would cease to exist on 31 March next. I expect to have a report on paediatric hospitals on or before that date. The content of the report will inform decisions on how to proceed beyond that date.</P>
        <P>To the end of December 2004, the total cost of the inquiry was approximately &euro;20 million. Total legal and administrative costs were approximately &euro;11 million, of which fees paid to the chairman amounted to &euro;2.29 million. The remainder of the costs include establishment, set-up and office rental costs of &euro;2.29 million, grants to the former Eastern Regional Health Authority of slightly more than &euro;5 million, grants to the Parents for Justice, PFJ, organisation of &euro;977,210 and legal fees to Kelly Noone, solicitors to PFJ, of &euro;800,942.</P>
        <P>The terms and conditions of the appointment remuneration of the chairman were subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance. The remuneration approved for the chairman on her appointment to the inquiry in 2000 was a brief fee of £30,000 or &euro;38,092, with a daily rate of £1,500 or &euro;1,905. The chairman requested an increase in her remuneration in 2001 and in 2003, but this was not conceded in either case.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the HSE is required, to the extent practicable and necessary to enable it to perform its functions, to facilitate the education and training of its employees and the employees of service providers.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the Health Service Executive that the training of nursing assistants and auxiliaries is comprehended by the national training programme for health care assistants. This training is designed to equip these staff with the skills and competencies required to ensure quality of care for members of the public. The training programme is accredited by the Further Education and Training Awards Council. It is understood that all training undertaken, to date, has been sourced from recognised <Col N="812"/>educational providers, primarily the centres for nurse education.</P>
        <P>A national process has been commenced by the Health Service Executive to identify, using focus groups, the skills and competencies necessary for the grade of home help. Following the completion of this work, appropriate training and education interventions will be designed and implemented by the HSE. It is envisaged that this training will be subject to similar quality controls as apply to the health care assistant training programme.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that it is the responsibility of each individual employer to ensure that staff are appropriately skilled and competent to carry out effectively and safely the responsibilities of their roles. In this context, it would be expected that training needs identified by the employer are met using recognised educational providers.</P>

	<P>There is a framework in place in my Department for the assignment of functions under the Public Service Management Act 1997 covering all individuals by name down to and including the principal officer <Col N="813"/>grade and a number of individuals at assistant principal level. These assignments are updated as appropriate and were last done on 1 September 2004 &mdash; a copy of the latter document has been forwarded to the Deputy for his information. To date none of the assignments for this Department, which are made under section 4(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997, has made specific reference to subsections (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of section 9 of the Act.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.4-?>
        <P>In addition to assignments of specific areas of work to named individuals, the framework also includes a generic statement of responsibilities for the grades of Secretary General, public service management and development, Second Secretary General, assistant secretary and principal officer. All framework documents to date have been published internally and are available upon request to members of the public.</P>
        <P>The assignments included in the framework are supported by a formal management structure and a business planning system. This business planning system is based on the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy and includes annual business plans for each assistant secretary and director area. These business plans are reviewed by the management advisory committee on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>The daily business of the Department is overseen by the management advisory committee, supported by groups it has established at assistant secretary, principal and assistant principal level. Each of these groups has been given responsibility for specific issues as considered appropriate. Finally, the Department has an audit committee with an external chairperson.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The principal mechanism for the assignment of functions to civil servants is the Public Service Management <Col N="814"/>Act 1997. There are a number of other legislative provisions which provide that particular matters may be delegated to officials; examples in my own Department include delegation of functions to officers in specified grades under section 4 of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 to 2003, and, under sections 3 and 13 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, nomination of certain post holders and grades as suspending authorities in cases of grave misconduct. In the normal course of public business, a number of functions are undertaken under implied delegation. Questions arising in relation to matters of implied delegation of functions are in the first instance for interpretation by the Department but ultimately are a matter for legal interpretation by the courts.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied with the system of delegation in the Department, which is kept under review.</P>

        <P>The total number of broadband subscribers in Ireland now exceeds 130,000. This figure is made up of approximately 114,000 digital subscriber lines, 3,600 leased lines, 6,000 cable, 8,700 fixed wireless and 230 satellite. These and other statistics are on the website <i>www.comreg.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>The latest figures shown on the website <i>www.internetworldstats.com</i> show 1.3 million Internet users in Ireland, or 32.8% of the population, an increase of 68% in the years 2000-2005. The penetration figure for the 25 countries of the EU is given as 44.8%.</P>

	<P>I understand that Eircom has 1166 telephone exchanges providing 1.6 million working lines. These exchanges vary in size, providing services to between 200 and 20,000 customers. Of the 1.6 million working lines, 1.44 million have access to DSL &mdash; broadband &mdash; through 233 enabled exchanges, and this will increase to 1.53 million during the next 12 months.</P>
        <P>Some 80% of lines connected to broadband enabled exchanges are capable of supplying broadband services to end-users and Eircom has publicly committed to ensuring that this is increased to 90% in the near term.</P>

	<P>My Department is at present considering an application for consent to install the onshore pipeline. Both the quantified risk assessment, QRA, and the Johnston report, to which I have referred previously, will form part of this process. In so far as there may be issues in the QRA that need further clarification, elaboration or even additional material, Mr. Andrew Johnston, assisted by other independent consultants, will be providing the necessary advice to my Department.</P>
        <P>On 21 February 2005, Shell reactivated its application for consent to install and commission phase 3: onshore pipeline and umbilical, originally submitted in June 2002. On 24 February 2005, my Department wrote to Shell requesting the clarification and elaboration of certain information and studies provided in the 2002 application.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department met with Shell on Friday 4 March 2005 to discuss these issues further. In the course of this meeting Shell advised that the company had appointed Shell Global Solutions to carry out a peer review on the QRA and any associated reports or studies submitted to the Department by the then operator, Enterprise Energy Ireland Ltd. Shell has agreed to submit these reports to my Department by early April of this year.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to appoint a consultant, who is an expert in quantified risk assessment, to review these documents and report to me on all aspects and especially that of public safety. I intend to publish these reports immediately when available. It is my intention to progress consideration of the application for consent to install the upstream pipeline in an open, balanced and informed manner. My decision to publish the full suite of documents mentioned above, prior to my making a decision, will, hopefully, allay local fears in regard to the safety of the pipeline and the process being adopted.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers. Since this person&rsquo;s detention, the consulate general in Boston has been actively providing consular assistance. It has been in regular contact with him as well as with family members in Ireland and the US. I understand also that the medication issues were resolved within 24 hours of the consulate&rsquo;s intervention.</P>
        <P>The person concerned seems to have remained in the United States without documentation for a number of years, following his original entry on a visa waiver. As a result, he is, I am afraid, subject to automatic deportation from the United States for breach of immigration law. The Deputy can be assured that the Department and the consulate will continue to monitor the case closely. The consulate remains in active, ongoing contact with the immigration authorities to secure the person&rsquo;s return at the earliest opportunity and will ensure that he and his family are kept fully abreast of developments.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The principal legislative provisions relating to the powers of Ministers and Government Departments are the Ministers and Secretaries Acts 1924-1995 and the Public Service Management Act 1997. Section 2(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 provides that each Minister as head of a Department of State shall be a corporation sole and shall have perpetual succession, an official seal, may sue and be sued and may acquire, hold and dispose of land for the purposes of the functions, powers or duties of the Department of State of which he or she is head or of any branch thereof. A Department of State has no legal personality separate from that of the Minister of the Government.</P>
        <P>A Minister, as a corporation sole, has the capacity to contract and, therefore, all contracts entered into under the ambit of the Department of Foreign Affairs are entered into in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or on behalf of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Ministers are responsible for the performance of functions that are assigned to them under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts. Under the Public Services Management Act 1997, Ministers retain responsibility for the performance of functions that are assigned to their Departments under these Acts, in particular for determining the policies to be implemented by the Department and accounting to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the administration of the Department. Sections 4 to 6 of the Act devolve authority, responsibility and accountability to Secretaries General for carrying out certain duties and management functions, including preparing an outline of how specific elements of departmental responsibilities are to be assigned <Col N="821"/>so as to ensure that the functions performed on behalf of the Minister are performed by an appropriate officer or an officer of an appropriate grade or rank.</P>
        <P>Under the powers vested in Secretaries General under section 4(1), the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs has assigned responsibilities to individual heads of divisions at headquarters on four occasions &mdash; 18 December 1998, 25 May 2000, 20 September 2001 and 1 October 2003 &mdash; and on one occasion to individual officers at counsellor and equivalent level, on 15 June 1999. The responsibilities assigned encompassed those listed at sections 9(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of the Act.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the formal assignment of responsibilities under the Act has given individual officers an increased sense of ownership of the work areas they manage and has resulted in an overall improvement in service. Responsibilities will be re-assigned in September next, following the planned rotation of a number of ambassadors and other senior officials in the summer. The new assignments will be based on the contents of the Department&rsquo;s new strategy statement for 2005-2007, which will be approved by me and published in the meantime. While information relating to such formal assignments of responsibilities is not published by the Department, the names of the heads of divisions and their specific responsibilities are published in Department&rsquo;s strategy statements.</P>
        <P>Unlike many other Ministers, upon whom extensive powers are conferred by statute, the Minister for Foreign Affairs is primarily responsible for exercising the executive power of the State in external relations as provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924. The statutory functions of a Minister may be assigned by the Government at the request of the Minister concerned to a Minister of State under section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1977. However, none of my statutory powers have been so assigned.</P>
        <P>While the principal mechanism for the assignment of functions to civil servants is the Public Service Management Act 1997, there are also a number of legislative provisions which provide that particular matters may be delegated to officials as prescribed in the relevant legislation. Examples include delegation of functions under section 4 the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 and nomination of certain post holders under section 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956. Generally, however, express delegations of statutory functions do not occur and civil servants exercise these powers in accordance with the general principles of constitutional and administrative law and the provisions of the Public Service Management Act.</P>
        <P>Under the Public Service Management Act, each Minister is obliged personally to approve, <Col N="822"/>with or without amendments, statements of strategy prepared and submitted by the Secretary General of his or her Department containing the key objectives of the Department and related outputs and strategies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 202 to 204, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The principal mechanism for the assignment of functions to civil servants is the Public Service Management Act 1997. Assignments of responsibility have been made by the Secretary General in my Department under section 9 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. The assignments, which were updated most recently in 2004, have been to the three named assistant secretaries and the nine named principal officers in the Department. Other than section 9(1)(<i>f</i>), relating to appointments, performance and discipline matters, which is dependent on separate legislation not yet enacted, the various issues dealt <Col N="824"/>with in section 9(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) of the Public Service Management Act 1997 are, as appropriate to the respective functions of assistant secretaries and principal officers, included in the assignments. The assignments are not published.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003, I have delegated all functions, other than the function of internal review, to the grade of assistant principal and upwards and I have delegated all functions, including internal review, to principal officers and upwards in my Department. Notice of the most recent FOI delegation order, which I made in July 2002, was published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.</P>
        <P>Under sections 3 and 13 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, certain post holders and grades are nominated as suspending authorities in cases of grave misconduct. In the normal course of public business, a number of functions are undertaken under implied delegation. Questions arising in relation to matters of implied delegation of functions are in the first instance for interpretation by the Department, but ultimately are a matter for legal interpretation by the courts. I am satisfied with the system of delegation in the Department, which is kept under review.</P>
        <P>The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 and the Public Service Management Act 1997 set out the legal position of Ministers and Departments. Section 3 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 restates the responsibility of Ministers for the performance of functions which are assigned to their Department. Section 2(1) of the Act of 1924 provides that each Minister shall be a corporation sole and shall have perpetual succession and an official seal, and may sue and be sued, and may acquire, hold and dispose of land for the purposes of the functions, powers or duties of the Department of State of which he is head or of any branch thereof. Section 4 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 sets out the responsibility and accountability within Departments and offices. Contracts and all other legal rights or liabilities are, either entered into, accepted or enjoyed in the name of the Minister or on behalf of the Minister.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Support for job creation and investment in individual counties is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts. Enterprise Ireland is the agency with responsibility for the development of indigenous industries. The county enterprise boards, CEB, have primary responsibility for the promotion of indigenous industry in the micro-enterprise sector and IDA Ireland has responsibility for the location for foreign direct investment in Ireland. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</P>
        <P>I have made inquiries from the agencies and I am informed that in terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions. Over the past three years, Enterprise Ireland approved funding of some &euro;1.7 million to client companies in Wicklow town and its environs, in which over 500 people are employed. These companies are committed to increasing their sales, exports and employment and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s investment was in areas such as research and development, capability building and process development.</P>
        <P>Wicklow County Enterprise Board was established in October 1993 to provide a source of support in the Wicklow area for small businesses with ten employees or fewer. The board&rsquo;s func<Col N="826"/>tion is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity throughout the county. The CEB can support individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability. During 2004, Wicklow CEB approved a total of &euro;189,316 to 21 projects and paid out over &euro;500,000 in capital assistance throughout the region. In 2005, Wicklow CEB will continue to be actively involved in the economic and social development of Wicklow town and the broader region and will continue to be proactive in ensuring that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality.</P>
        <P>As regards foreign direct investment, the pace of technological change throughout the world is unprecedented and accelerating, while new global business models are transforming the structures of companies in many sectors. This transformation is leading to new patterns of international investment with companies locating activities where it makes best business sense. This new order is creating new demands for high levels of knowledge and skills. The countries that are benefiting most are those that can deliver the sufficiently skilled labour force and have the capacity to embrace change, retain flexibility and promote knowledge-intensive economic activity. In delivering on the strategy of achieving a balanced spread of development across the country, IDA Ireland works closely with other organisations to create attractive and competitive locational solutions in all regions in Ireland for foreign owned business.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies, together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will bear fruit in terms of additional sustainable investment and jobs for Wicklow town and surrounding areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 208 together.</P>
        <P>Each year, under section 4(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997, all seven assistant secretaries in my Department are assigned by name, authority and responsibility from the Secretary General for matters within the remit of their respective divisions, including the following requirements listed in section 9 of the Act: provision of policy advice in relation to the subject matter of the assignment and other related matters; achievement of the outputs associated with the area of assignment as specified in the Department&rsquo;s strategy statement and in the business plans or as directed by the Secretary General; responsibility for the delivery of quality services in the area of the assignment; ensuring that the expenditure made in respect of the area of the assignment accords with the purpose for which the expenditure was chargeable to the appropriation account of the Department and that value for money is obtained; in particular, ensuring that effective systems of financial control are in place, that procedures are adequately documented, and that staff implement appropriate financial and risk management procedures; and responsibility for the management, including discipline, performance and development of staff in the area of assignment.</P>
        <P>Further assignments for specific responsibilities are then made to the level of the principal or assistant principal, as fits the circumstances. My Department does not publish these assignments but details can be furnished to any interested parties. I am satisfied with the workings of section 9 of the Public Service Management Act in my Department.</P>
        <P>In addition to formal delegations of functions under the Public Service Management Act 1997, a number of other delegations of functions are in place in my Department. Section 4 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as amended, pro<Col N="828"/>vides for the delegation of certain functions under that Act: in effect the functions of primary decision maker and internal review decision maker. This is an express delegation, it applies in all cases where freedom of information decisions or internal reviews are required in the Department, and is made to particular grades of officer.</P>
        <P>The Act does not permit the delegation of functions provided for under sections 4 and 25, so these functions are reserved for the Minister. As required under the Act at that time, notice of this delegation was published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> on Friday 1 May 1998, although such publication is no longer required under the amended Act. A review by the Information Commissioner of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act published in June 2004 concluded, <i>inter alia</i>, that public bodies appear to operate the Act in a fair and balanced manner, and I am satisfied that this particular delegation is appropriate and works well. Enterprise area certificates are issued under section 343 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This function is delegated to certain officers at assistant secretary level, as appropriate.</P>
        <P>Under section 16 of the National Standards Authority of Ireland Act 1996, I have authorised two named officers at assistant secretary and principal officer grades to authenticate instruments &mdash; Irish Standards. Under sections 2(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No.2) Act 1977, I requested that the Government delegate certain powers and duties to the Ministers of State at this Department. In December 2004, two Orders, SI Nos. 808 and 809 of 2004, were signed which delegated a number of my ministerial functions to the Ministers of State. Deputy Tony Killeen was delegated a number of functions relating to labour affairs and Deputy Michael Ahern was delegated functions of trade and commerce. The orders included a schedule of primary and secondary legislation containing ministerial powers, which were delegated to each Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Section 15(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 provides that the seal of the Minister shall be authenticated by the signature of the Minister or some person authorised by that Minister to act in that behalf. I have authorised named officers of the Department to authenticate by their signature the official seal of the Minister under section 15(1). This list is currently being updated to take account of staff changes.</P>
        <P>In addition, under section 15(4) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, I have authorised named officers of the Department to sign, as may be required from time to time, regulations or other instruments issued at my direction or on my behalf. This covers instances when the seal is not expressly necessary for validity of an order or other instrument. The order or other instrument <Col N="829"/>shall be sufficiently authenticated by my signature or by that of the Secretary General or other officer of the Department duly authorised by me. This authorisation is currently being updated to take into account of staff changes.</P>
        <P>I have nominated named officers as suspending authorities in relation to all established and unestablished civil servants serving within the Department under section 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956. Following discussions with senior officials in my Department, I have satisfied myself that all of the above delegations of ministerial functions are working well. Where not expressly published by way of statutory instrument or regulation, information relating to the above assignments is available to any interested party on request.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Council Directive 96/82/EC, the Seveso directive, which is transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000, SI 476 of 2000, requires, under article 12, that the objectives of preventing major accidents and limiting the consequences of such accidents are taken into account by the member states in their land use policies and or other relevant policies. It requires in the interests of safety that these policies must take account of the need, in the long term, to maintain appropriate distances between establishments covered by the directive and residential areas, areas of public use and areas of particular natural sensitivity or interest.</P>
        <P>The directive further requires that the procedures set up to implement these policies must be designed to ensure that technical advice on the risks arising from the establishment is available, either on a case by case or on a generic basis, when decisions are taken. Regulation 29 of the <Col N="831"/>European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000 covers the provision of such technical advice to planning authorities by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
        <P>The planning authorities are the major decision makers in relation to plants which fall under the terms of the regulations. The planning authorities consult the Health and Safety Authority which gives technical advice on land use policy. Circumstances may arise from time to time in which the implications of policy can, in the interests of health and safety, impose restrictions on usage of property. However, these restrictions are not unilateral. All plants affected by the directive are subject to the planning process which in itself has an appeals process built in and is transparent. Likewise, property owners whose land use may be restricted or otherwise affected by a proposed plant are entitled to avail of the planning and appeal process.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Control of Major Accident Hazards Involving Dangerous Substances) Regulations 2000, which transpose Council Directive 96/82/EC, the Seveso directive, into Irish law require that upper tier establishments covered by the regulations produce a safety report. The safety report is required to be made available to any member of the public who requests it under Regulation 19(1)(<i>b</i>). Risk assessments carried out by lower tier establishments are not required, under the regulations, to be made available to the public. They are available to the authority&rsquo;s inspectors as part of their inspection activities.</P>
        <P>The difference between upper and lower tier establishments, in terms of Directive 96/82/EC, is based on the levels of dangerous substances held at that establishment. The relevant quantities of dangerous substances, which determine an establishment to be upper &mdash; the most hazardous &mdash; or lower tier, are listed in annex 1 to Council Directive 96/82/EC.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</P>
        <P>The objective of the assignment of responsibility under sections 4 and 9 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 is to ensure that functions performed on behalf of a Minister and the Government are performed by an appropriate officer or an officer of appropriate grade or rank. The process has been operating in a satisfactory manner in my Department.</P>
        <P>This process was recently reviewed in my Department in order to take account of various developments in the public service modernisation programme and to continue to reflect the requirements of section 9(1) of the Act. A revised outline of the assignment of responsibility and accountability within my Department was prepared in accordance with section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Act. On foot of this, revised letters of assignment were issued to officers at principal officer grade and above in the Department. The details of these assignments are available on request from my Department.</P>
        <P>The Public Service Management Act 1997 established a framework within which, subject to the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, managerial responsibility, including powers of dismissal, for staff below the level of principal officer would be given to Secretaries General. The 1997 Act also envisaged, in section 9(1)(<i>f</i>), that Secretaries <Col N="833"/>General could delegate most personnel functions, other than dismissal, to other civil servants. However, the practical implementation of these powers and functions is constrained by the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, which reserves most disciplinary functions to Ministers as the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; for these matters. Under the 1956 Act, the authority to suspend a civil servant has, in practice, been delegated to certain officials of the Department.</P>
        <P>The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is currently on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il will, <i>inter alia</i>, make Secretaries General the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; for civil servants below the rank of principal officer and they will then be responsible for managing all matters relating to performance, discipline and possible dismissal of those civil servants. The Minister in charge of the Department will continue to be the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; for civil servants at or above principal level.</P>
        <P>Under the Social Welfare Acts I have authorised certain officials of the Department to appoint social welfare inspectors for specified purposes and to institute proceedings for an offence under the Acts. Decisions concerning entitlement to statutory schemes and insurability of employment are, under the Social Welfare Acts, made by deciding officers in the first instance and may be appealed to the chief appeals officer and decided by him or her or an appeals officer. These named officers are statutorily appointed by me in accordance with legislation and are completely independent in the exercise and discharge of their functions, which are specified in the Social Welfare Acts and regulations. The authority to make regulations is reserved to me.</P>
        <P>There are a limited number of schemes administered by the Department which are not statutory schemes. Entitlement to these schemes is determined by officers of the Department in accordance with detailed conditions agreed, as appropriate by the Department of Finance. A person who is dissatisfied with a decision concerning his or her entitlement under these schemes has the right to seek a review by a higher officer. Decisions on matters such as the award of credits, recovery of overpayments and the furnishing of information in relation to claims are also made not by statutorily appointed officers but by officers of my Department in accordance with detailed published guidelines which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. None of these decisions is reserved to me personally.</P>

	<P>Having reviewed the medical evidence in this case, an increase in her carer&rsquo;s allowance has been awarded. A personal rate of &euro;230.40 per week will apply with effect from 20 January 2005. This represents the maximum personal rate payable to a person providing full-time care and attention to two persons. She has been notified of this decision and her revised payment will be lodged to her nominated bank account in week ending Friday, 18 March 2005. Arrears of allowance due will issue to her thereafter.</P>
        <P>Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The figures represent counts of provisional licence categories and not provisional licences, namely, number of licensed drivers holding provisional licences. Totals by category do not equal the total number of licences, because a provisional licence may have more than one category and each category can be of a different classification, namely, first, second, third and so forth. For example, a driver has a provisional licence with two categories, A and B. Category A is a first provisional and B is a second; this constitutes one provisional licence, but two provisional categories.</P>
        <P>Also, where categories on a multi-category licence all have the same provisional count, each category is counted separately, for example, a current provisional licence with four first provisional categories A, B, M, W will be counted four times. The figures in the table will include this licence four times, one first A, one first B, one first M and one first W. For category B, a car without a trailer, there are 152,404 licences with first provisionals, 90,155 with second provisionals, 41,056 with third provisionals and so forth. Some of these licences may also contain other categories, for example, category M, moped, category W, work vehicle-tractor and so forth, which are counted separately.</P>
        <P>The total number of current provisional licences on 31 December 2004 is 380,347.</P>

	<P>The principal mechanism for the assignment of functions to civil servants is the Public Service Management Act 1997, and the relevant sections are 4, 9 and 12. There are a number of legislative provisions which provide that particular matters may be delegated to officials as prescribed in the relevant legislation; examples include delegation of functions under section 4 the Freedom of Information Acts 1997 to 2003 and nomination of certain post holders under section 3 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956. Implied delegation of functions is a matter of legal interpretation by the courts.</P>
        <P>Separately, functions have been assigned to the Minister of State under the transport delegation of functions orders as provided under section 2(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) (No.2) Act 1977 (No. 28 of 1977)</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy to a reply to Questions Nos. 340 to 345, inclusive, answered on 18 November 2003 which <Col N="838"/>includes information relating to the approach surfaces of the runways at Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>As I have mentioned in previous replies to the House on 1 July 2003, the present red zones at Dublin Airport were formally established in 1968. I understand that the red zones at Cork and Shannon were drawn up around the same time. The then Department of Transport and Power was originally responsible for proposing the establishment of the zones, which were approved and incorporated in the local authorities&rsquo; development plans, and development within those red zones is controlled by the local authorities through the Planning Acts.</P>
        <P>I should at this point describe for the Deputy precisely what the red zones are, and how they differ from public safety zones and protected areas. International civil aviation operates under the 1944 Chicago Convention, which is administered by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, CAO. Annex 14 of the convention, which prescribes standards for aerodromes, recommends that certain pathways through the air on approaches to runways should be clear of obstacles at certain heights, depending on how far away they are from the runway. These are known as &ldquo;obstacle clearance surfaces&rdquo;, and are imaginary slopes in the air extending away from the ends of runways. They were designed for the protection of aircraft taking off and landing, as an aid to safe navigation. If those slopes in the air are, on a map, projected onto the ground, they form a trapezoid shape, with the narrow base at the end of the runway.</P>
        <P>Those shapes have been coloured red on maps for ease of identification, and have therefore been known as red zones. The present dimensions of the red zones were established in 1968, and were notified to the local authorities on whose land the State airports are situated. While the width of the red zones was the same as the projection onto the ground of the obstacle limitation surfaces, the length of the red zones was delineated by the officials of the then Department of Transport and Power at specific distances from the runway, which varied by runway orientation, by airport, and by projected air traffic density.</P>
        <P>In delineating the length of the red zones in particular, the then Department was seeking to assist the local authorities to have regard to the dimension of public safety in the vicinity of the airports, namely, the safety of people on the ground, living or working underneath an approaching or departing aircraft. In Ireland, as elsewhere, these zones have been used as a basis for restricting development to limit the numbers of people on the ground who may be killed or injured by a crashing aircraft.</P>
        <P>Public safety zones are different, in that they are zones that are specifically designed with a view to protecting the public on the ground, and they have a substantially different size and shape from &rdquo;red zones. Public safety is not covered by an ICAO standard. The Department of Trans<Col N="839"/>port, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, commissioned consultants to make recommendations for such public safety zones in the vicinity of Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports. The recommendations of the consultants, ERM, specifically deal with the risk to people on the ground, and make use of the latest techniques in risk assessment. That study is now complete, and was formally presented to myself and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 30 September 2003. In preparing their report, the consultants engaged in a comprehensive public consultation, including holding public meetings in Cork, Dublin and Shannon during the summer.</P>
        <P>The intention now is that the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will issue planning guidelines based on the public safety zones identified in the consultants&rsquo; report to the local authorities to assist them in their consideration of the public safety aspects of planning applications in the vicinity of airports.</P>
        <P>I should, of course, also point out that the obstacle clearance surfaces are not affected by the report by ERM. Those surfaces will continue to be a matter for the IAA, who will be responsible solely for advising the planning authorities in relation to the aviation operational safety implications associated with particular proposals or planning applications. In future it will be a matter for the IAA to modify, if it sees fit and acting on ICAO advice, the geometry or dimensions of the obstacle clearance surfaces themselves.</P>
        <P>Regarding protected areas, section 14 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1950 empowers the Minister to make an order to declare that a particular piece of land in the vicinity of an aerodrome was to be a protected area, if the unrestricted use of that land would interfere with the navigation of aircraft.</P>
        <P>Of the three terms, red zone, public safety zone and protected area, only the red zones are three-dimensional surfaces in the sky, in so far as they are used to protect the safe navigation of aircraft. In so far as the red zones, as projected onto maps, have been used in the past for public safety purposes, they are two-dimensional surfaces on the ground. Both public safety zones and protected areas are two dimensional surfaces on the ground.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the IAA, that the slope of the first section of the approach surface, which forms part of the obstacle limitation surfaces, as defined in chapter 4 of annex 14 to the Chicago Convention, for runway 10-28 at Dublin Airport is 2%. The maximum height of an object beneath the approach surface, to avoid infringing the surface, is a function of the threshold elevation and the ground elevation of the site. Without knowing the ground elevation at a particular position, it is not possible to determine the maximum permissible height of a construction. I am advised by the IAA <Col N="840"/>that the respective sizes of the first section of the obstacle surface on the approach to the runways at Dublin Airport, with particular reference to inner and outer widths, slope, divergence and length, are as follows: </P>

	<P>Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of Council Directive 2003/50/EC, which reinforced controls on movement of sheep and goats. These controls, which are a direct consequence of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, came into effect on 1 July 2004. They provide, as a minimum requirement, that breeding sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export including a so-called &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding.</P>
        <P>Breeding sheep may be certified for export either from the holding of origin or from an approved assembly centre. Where breeding sheep are presented for certification at an approved assembly centre, they can be moved only direct from the holding of origin to the approved assembly centre. Between leaving the holding of origin and arriving at destination, the sheep must not come into contact with other cloven hoofed animals other than those of the same breeding health status.</P>
        <P>Apart from the foregoing, EU rules also provide that in relation to trade in the context of scrapie, all breeding sheep must be either of the ARR-ARR prion protein genotype or have been kept in a scrapie monitored flock for at least three years with no cases of scrapie being confirmed during this period. These rules apply across the EU and between Northern Ireland and the Republic.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department recently met with delegations representing the sheep industry in County Wicklow and the current legal requirements were discussed in detail.</P>

        <P>In addition, there is a large body of legislation including Acts of the Oireachtas as well as regulations made thereunder and statutory instruments transposing EU directives specific to my Department. Many of these Acts and statutory <Col N="846"/>instruments provide for me as Minister to delegate functions prescribed in the legislation to officers of my Department. The delegation of functions may be to particular posts or grades or to named individuals who would for instance have specific functions and powers in the fields of animal and plant heath, public health and animal welfare. Any functions that are not so delegated and are prescribed in legislation as a function of the Minister is then reserved to me personally in my capacity as the Minister for Agriculture and Food.

	<P>I can confirm that an application to the national reserve has been received from the person named who has applied under category B &mdash; the investment category.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to the 2005 single payment national reserve is that all applications are being processed at present and in view of the number of applications received and accompanying documentation submitted, it will be some time before processing is completed. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible to indicate at this stage whether the person named will qualify for an allocation of entitlements from the reserve on foot of an application <Col N="847"/>submitted. Applicants will be notified of their eligibility or otherwise as soon as all applications are processed.</P>
        <P>The person named had previously applied to have his case treated as one of<i> force majeure</i> but since the reasons put forward may have been regarded as <i>force majeure</i> in respect of 1995 when the flooding took place, they could not be deemed to be <i>force majeure</i> in respect of 2002. His application was rejected accordingly. He appealed this decision to the independent single payment appeals committee which, having examined the full circumstances of the case, recommended that my Department&rsquo;s decision should be upheld.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 to 252, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The weighting for the selection criterion relating to public transport was not changed once it was agreed by the committee at its meeting on 9 July 2004. In any event as can be seen from the <Col N="851"/>reports of the committee, it transpires that no site was ruled out solely because of failure to meet the public transport criterion because all such sites also failed on other criteria.</P>
        <P>The site at Balbriggan was originally ruled out on cost grounds at the meeting of 9 July 2004 but was reconsidered at the meeting of 16 September 2004. It was ruled out again at that stage because it was too far from the M50. The site at Leixlip was marked in detail at the meeting of 15 July 2004 but did not make it into the top five sites. It is also further than eight kilometres from the M50 and did not fall within the revised guidelines agreed at the committee&rsquo;s meeting of 16 September 2004.</P>
        <P>No site at Abbottstown was assessed by the committee. I understand that the land in question was under consideration for other uses.</P>

Given the very extensive range of functions for which I am responsible under legislation as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is not practical to delegate specifically in each case. Many of these functions are exercised or administered on my behalf by officials of my Department without any express delegation by me. Whereas certain functions under Acts have been formally delegated by me to officers of a particular grade, for example, under the Documentary Evidence Act 1925 and the Freedom of Information Act 1997, the performance of other functions under Acts, such as the making of deportation orders and decisions in relation to the acquisition or otherwise of citizenship through naturalisation under the Immigration Act 2004, are reserved to the Minister.</P>

        <P>The main funding for the organisations supporting victims of such violence is allocated by the Department of Health and Children. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for the provision of health and social services to victims of violence, including domestic violence, rape and sexual assault. In the main, these services are provided by non-governmental organisations who receive funding for this work from the Department of Health and Children <Col N="854"/>through the relevant health boards. In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government assists in the provision of crisis accommodation, such as refuges.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for any necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice systems, for any preventative measures which can be put in place, including intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence, and for awareness raising measures aimed at changing society&rsquo;s attitude to violence against women. My Department also co-ordinates the work of the national steering committee on violence against women. The Department of Education and Science is responsible for measures to educate children in relation to the issue in the schools, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has responsibilities for family support issues and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has responsibility for funding community development programmes and organisations.</P>

	<P>The Dublin city child care committee is one of the 33 city and county child care committees, CCCs, that were established as part of the quality measure under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, to develop child care at local level.

        <P>Funding for the Dublin city child care committee has increased in line with inflation to &euro;344,000 for 2005 and this has been supplemented by funding of &euro;100,000 in 2005 for its locally focused initiatives and by funding of &euro;70,000 for the childminders initiative.

	<P>The Government took a decision in 1998 that has transformed the level of provision for pupils with special educational needs, including those with mild and borderline mild general learning disabilities. Pupils with such needs would be entitled to an automatic response to meet those needs and the allocation of resources to meet those needs no longer depended, as it had in the past, on the limited resources that were available to meet those needs. Instead, the response was based on the nature of the disability involved and once the required supporting professional assessments were made available, the resources were automatically allocated. It was this decision that gave rise to an enormous expansion in resourcing levels in schools.</P>
        <P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 and due to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>In light of the possible impact on small and rural schools, I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the general allocation model. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time for implementation for the next school year.</P>

	<P>I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools on anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum.</P>
        <P>SPHE is now a compulsory subject at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills, including self awareness, respect for others, self esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand entitled &ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo;, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on belonging and integrating.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in a policy in place which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise <Col N="859"/>awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
        <P>Current provision for pupils with autism include: the creation of 141 special classes for children with autism attached to special schools and mainstream schools; the establishment of ten pre-school classes for children with autism; the funding of eight autism facilities, some of which are providing an applied behavioural analysis model of response to children with autism; and the creation of five special classes for children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.</P>
        <P>All such classes operate at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 with the support of a minimum of two special needs assistants. The level of resource teaching support provided to pupils with autism attending mainstream primary schools is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. In general, such pupils would be eligible for five hours resource teaching support. In addition, my Department may sanction home tuition grants for children with autism for whom a home based applied behavioural analysis programme is considered appropriate or in cases where such children are awaiting an appropriate school placement.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that with effect from 1 January 2005 the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs and in particular it is responsible for the following: deciding on applications for resource teaching hours in respect of children with low incidence disabilities with special educational needs at primary level; deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; and deciding on applications for special needs assistant, SNA, hours.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the <Col N="862"/>outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents where appropriate and will, at the end of the process, outline the basis upon which the decision was made. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in the area referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a circular and letter advising the authorities of primary and post-primary schools respectively of the arrangements put in place as a result of the transfer of these functions to the NCSE. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

	<P>Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</P>
        <P>Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes or units attached to ordinary schools to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools with special back up supports. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Many children with such needs are capable of attending mainstream schools on a fully integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of special resource teachers and or special needs assistants.</P>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are three special schools in operation in County Kildare at present catering for approximately 157 pupils with special needs with a pupil-teacher ratio ranging from 6:1 to 11:1. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>In addition to these special schools, I can confirm that the following special needs provision in County Kildare has been sanctioned by my Department to cater for the special educational needs, SEN, of pupils: nine special classes for pupils with autism at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; six special classes for pupils with mild general learning disabilities at a pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1; one special class for pupils with moderate general learning disabilities at a pupil-teacher ratio of 8:1.</P>
        <P>All special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with special educational needs attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and in that way benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers.</P><Col N="864"/>
        <P>My Department also provides funding for the saplings project, a facility sanctioned on a pilot basis which uses applied behavioural analysis methodologies for children with autism. There are approximately 30 children enrolled in the facility.</P>
        <P>While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure if appropriate.</P>
        <P>In 1998 the Government took a decision which has transformed the level of provision for pupils with special educational needs, including those with mild and borderline mild general learning disabilities and dyslexia. Pupils with such needs are entitled to an automatic response to meet those needs and the allocation of resources to meet those needs no longer depends, as it had in the past, on the limited resources that were available. The response is instead based on the nature of the disability involved and once the required supporting professional assessments are made available the resources are automatically allocated. It was this decision which gave rise to an enormous expansion in resourcing levels in schools.</P>
        <P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department in consultation with educational interests developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>In light of the possible impact on small and rural schools I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the general allocation model. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>
        <P>In the lower incidence disability categories resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications.

	<P>Between 1998 and 2004 over &euro;920 million has been invested on primary educational infrastructure relating to individual building projects, site purchases, dust, asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science initiatives, contingency, furniture and equipment. This investment has delivered 84 new school buildings, over 350 large scale refurbishment and extension projects, over 6,000 smaller scale projects and thousands of other small scale works under the annual minor works grant.</P>
        <P>The Government remains committed to continuing the work it has started and to consolidating the substantial progress already made to ensure that the needs of schools throughout the country are met over time. Proof of this commitment is that this year&rsquo;s school building programme is the largest in the history of the State. Out of an overall capital budget of &euro;493 million for schools, &euro;270 million is available for primary school investment. This brings to almost &euro;1.2 billion the amount that will have been invested since 1998 on primary schools.</P>
        <P>I recently announced the first phases of the 2005 school building and modernisation programme which provided the following details: 122 major school building projects country wide, including 89 primary school projects which will prepare tenders and move to construction during the next 12 to 15 months; an additional 171 primary schools which will be invited to deliver their building projects on the basis of devolved funding; 43 schools, of which 32 are primary schools, which will be authorised to commence architectural planning; and 590 schools approved for funding under the 2005 summer works scheme, over 360 of which are primary schools.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, approximately &euro;18 million in respect of all primary schools will be issued under the devolved grant to enable schools to carry out minor works. Each primary school gets a standard grant of &euro;3,809 together with a per pupil rate of &euro;12.70.</P>
        <P>I plan to make further announcements in the coming period on the school building and modernisation programme which will include details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships and schools <Col N="866"/>whose projects will further progress through the design process.</P>

	<P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available for the current school year. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class size of 29 pupils in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29 it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the available teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>The Deputy should note that significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The national average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996 to 1997. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996 to 1997 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003 to 2004.</P>
        <P>Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the Giving Children an Even Break and Breaking the Cycle programmes, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced maximum class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class.</P>
        <P>In line with Government policy, the position will be improved further in the future within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

	<P>It is the policy of my Department to provide a permanent accommodation solution in so far as possible to meet accommodation demands in schools. However, the time span involved in architectural design and obtaining planning permission effectively means that it may not be possible in all instances to provide a permanent accommodation solution as soon as it is <Col N="867"/>required and in these cases temporary accommodation is provided as an interim measure.</P>
        <P>This Government has shown its commitment to modernising the facilities in our schools, including the replacement of prefabricated buildings with permanent accommodation, through the record levels of funding for school building works in recent years. Next year we will spend &euro;493 million on school buildings, which represents an increase of 14% on 2004 and is six times the 1997 allocation.</P>
        <P>Modernising the facilities in all 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in new population areas. However, I am determined to ensure that every child in this country is educated in a suitable and comfortable environment. The 14% increase in funding for school buildings in 2005 is clear proof of my commitment to this goal.</P>
        <P>Since the beginning of the year I have made a number of announcements relating to the school building and modernisation programme. In this year alone &euro;270 million will be allocated to primary schools and &euro;223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1998, the Government took a decision that has transformed the level of provision for pupils with special educational needs, including those with mild and borderline mild general learning disabilities and dyslexia. Pupils with such needs are entitled to an automatic response to meet those needs and the allocation of resources to meet those needs no longer depends as in the past on the limited resources that were available. The response is instead based on the nature of the disability involved and once the required supporting professional assessments are made available the resources are automatically allocated. It was this decision which gave rise to an enormous expansion in resourcing levels in schools.</P>
        <P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department in consultation with educational interests developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>In light of the possible impact on small and rural schools I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the general allocation model. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>
        <P>In the lower incidence disability categories resources will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual applications. It is important that where there is a particular and special need in the low incidence category these children are considered individually. These pupils are not evenly distributed among schools and a general allocation model would not be appropriate. However, the involvement of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the special education needs organisers will greatly <Col N="869"/>enhance the speed of response to such applications.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>The project for the school referred to by the Deputy is one of 122 major school projects to proceed to tender and construction over the next 12 to 15 months. My Department&rsquo;s building unit held general information meetings for all these schools to guide them through the process involved in moving projects to tender and construction. These meetings took place on 31 January and 1 February in Tullamore and the school in question attended the meeting. My Department expects to be in contact with the school in the coming weeks in relation to the delivery of this project.</P>

	<P>Newly established schools are generally required to undergo a period of provisional recognition, during which the operation of the school and the growth of pupil numbers are monitored. During that period, it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation. This accommodation should be capable of fully meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and my Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>The school in question received provisional recognition with effect from September 2002. An application for permanent recognition has been received and is currently under consideration in the school planning section of my Department. As part of the examination, factors such as the future viability of the school, current and projected enrolments and suitability of accommodation will be considered. A decision on the school&rsquo;s application will be made as soon as pos<Col N="873"/>sible and the board of management will be notified accordingly.</P>

        <P>Phase two of the extension project at the school to which the Deputy refers has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria, which were revised following consultation with the education partners. Progress on this project is being considered in the context of the school building programme. In this regard, the Deputy may be aware that I recently announced the first phase of the 2005 school <Col N="874"/>building programme which provided details of 122 major school building projects country wide that will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005. In addition, I have further approved the next phase of the programme under which 192 schools will be allocated funding to undertake projects, such as extensions and refurbishments. These projects will proceed immediately on a devolved basis.</P>
        <P>I have also just recently announced further phases of the school building and modernisation programme to include: expansion of the number of schools and extension of the scope of the projects approved under the summer works scheme; schools that will be authorised to commence architectural planning. I plan to make further announcements shortly in relation to the schools building and modernisation programme that will include: schools whose projects will further progress through the design process; details of schools identified as suitable for construction under public private partnerships.</P>

	<P>Children with dyslexia have, up to now, generally been catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present, there are approximately 2,600 resource teachers and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.</P>
        <P>Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals.</P><Col N="880"/>
        <P>In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>In light of the possible impact on small and rural schools, I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the general allocation model. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</P>
        <P>At second level, each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of less than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post-leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more, receive a full learning support post. The Department also allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special needs, including pupils with dyslexia.</P>
        <P>There are a total of 528 remedial learning support teachers, 620 guidance posts and 1,387 wholetime equivalent resource teachers currently in place. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with a specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department established the special education support service, SESS, to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The SESS, which is hosted in Laois Education Centre, provides a nationwide service to teachers and special needs assistants. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in the specific areas of autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the education centre network.</P><Col N="881"/>
        <P>In addition, my Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-ROM, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary schools and will issue to post-primary schools shortly.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. The position in the case referred to by the Deputy remains the same as outlined in my previous parliamentary response to the Deputy of 10 February in that, to date, it appears that no such advice or instruction has been sought in relation to the student concerned.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may itself, in exceptional circumstances, seek clarification on issues from my Department.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 323 to 325, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Assignments of responsibility have been made to named officers at assistant secretary and principal officer levels in respect of all of the elements described in section 4(1), paragraphs (<i>d</i>) to (<i>h</i>) of the Public Service Management Act 1997. All of the requirements listed in section 9(1), paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>f</i>) of the Act have been included in each assignment. Information relating to the assignments is not published. I am satisfied with the workings of the Act in my Department.</P>
        <P>In pursuance of the provisions of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 and of the Documentary Evidence Act 1925, named officials in certain grades have been authorised by formal delegation instrument to sign official letters, orders for supplies and services, regulations, departmental instructions or other instruments at my direction or on my behalf. In the same manner, named senior officials have been authorised by formal delegation instrument to authenticate my ministerial seal by their signature. I also nominate by formal delegation instrument named senior officials to be suspending authorities for the purposes of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 in respect of civil servants employed in the Department.</P><Col N="883"/>
        <P>In general, powers exercisable by me under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts 1932 to 1975, and the schemes made thereunder, and the Army Pensions Acts 1923 to 1980 are delegated to departmental officials by means of a formal delegation instrument which contains details of the powers delegated. The delegation is express and is to officers of particular grades. No functions are specifically reserved to me as Minister personally.</P>
        <P>Under the Defence Acts 1954 to 1998, express responsibility for the overall management of the Defence Forces, including responsibility for effectiveness, efficiency, military organisation and economy, is assigned to the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces who is responsible to me in this respect. Military command and authority has been delegated to each of the general officers commanding, GOC, of the three territorial brigades, eastern, southern and western, to the GOCs of the Defence Forces training centre and the Air Corps and to the flag officer commanding of the Naval Service. The officers mentioned are responsible to me for the exercise of the command and authority delegated.</P>
        <P>The system of delegation as outlined above works well and is kept under review. Information on the general arrangements relating to delegation under the Defence Acts is published in strategy statements and annual reports but information on other forms of delegation is not published outside the Department.</P>
        <P>With reference to the question of the identification for legal and administrative purposes of the Department as an entity separate from the Minister, no distinction is made in that regard. By virtue of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, and the fact that the Minister is a corporation sole with perpetual succession and an official seal, contracts or other legal rights or liabilities are entered into and accepted, explicitly or implicity, in the name of the Minister or on the Minister&rsquo;s behalf.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Fleming</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>the reason the Defence Force pension for a person (details supplied) in County Laois was reduced with effect from 21 January 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8230/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="WillieODea"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dea</NameTxt>
	<P>At the outset, I should explain that, under the Defence Forces pension schemes, the minimum service required for an immediate pension in the case of NCOs and privates is 21 years. The pension for 21 years&rsquo; service consists of a basic flat rate pension which varies according to rank, an addition in respect of military service allowance, MSA, in the case of qualified personnel discharged since August 1990 and an addition in respect of technician pay and certain other additional payments that were held during service. All of these <Col N="884"/>elements of pension are payable for the lifetime of the pensioner.</P>
        <P>Where service exceeds 21 years, the Defence Forces pension is increased by an additional increment for each such year of service up to a maximum of 31 years. This additional increment is payable at a flat rate for each year of service with a small increase if the individual qualifies for the addition in respect of technician pay and certain other additional payments that were held during service. A top up of the MSA addition is also payable in the case of personnel with 31 years service or more. These extra payments cease to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 years for an old age contributory pension or becomes entitled at an earlier age to a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
        <P>These arrangements are in accordance with the principle of integration of occupational pensions with social insurance benefits in the case of employees, such as NCOs and privates, who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts. This principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector. However, the method of applying the integration principle in the case of retired NCOs and privates is less severe than that applying in other areas of the public service.</P>
        <P>The person referred to reached 66 years of age on 21 January 2005 and the arrangements mentioned were applied to his Defence Forces pension from that date.</P>
        <P>The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the commission on public service pensions in its final report, published in January 2001. The commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component of the public service pensions framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and privates.</P>

        <Quest> further to Parliamentary Question No. 374 of 28 October 2004 and the Snow report, the way in which he justifies the assertion therein that the associated current safety policy at Casement Aerodrome reflects best international practice in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation standards and recommendations (details supplied); the size of the respective RESAs at Casement Aerodrome; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>A runway end safety area, RESA, is defined as &ldquo;an area symmetrical about the extended runway centreline and adjacent to the end of the strip primarily intended to reduce the risk of damage to an aeroplane undershooting or overshooting the runway&rdquo;. RESAs are contained completely within the airfield boundary and are referred to <Col N="885"/>in International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, annex 14, &ldquo;Aerodromes&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Red safety zones, or public safety zones, are not an ICAO requirement. However, the practice of using such zones obtains in other countries and, in this regard, the Department has followed the United Kingdom model. The Snow report, 1999, recommended the continued use of safety zones at Casement Aerodrome. Such similar public safety areas are in place at civil airports. At Casement Aerodrome the RESAs lie within the red safety zones, which are, approximately, 300 m to 700 m wide and 1370 m long.</P>

	<P>Development contributions are levied by each planning authority on the basis of a development contribution scheme which sets out how contributions will apply in its area. Such schemes had to be adopted by all planning authorities by 10 March 2004. The level of contribution and the types of development to which development contribution schemes should apply was determined at local level, with responsibility resting with the elected members in each area.</P>
        <P>While the Department did not advise planning authorities on the appropriate amounts to be levied in respect of any individual type of development, authorities were advised by way of circular letter PD 4 of 2003 that, while it was expected that the planning authority should ensure that developers make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, the local authority should take care to avoid development contributions that are excessively high. In addition, authorities were advised to be mindful of the policies adopted by other local authorities in their immediate area when devising and implementing development contribution schemes as major divergence in the level of contributions may be difficult to defend.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 330 and 331 together.</P>
        <P>To give effect to section 9 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 the Secretary General of my Department has assigned responsibilities to all assistant secretaries within the Department. The assignment of responsibilities under section 9(f) will be considered further following the enactment of the Civil Service Regulation (1956 Act) (Amendment) Bill. While details of the assignment of responsibilities to assistant secretaries are not published, my Department&rsquo;s annual report provides a breakdown of the Department&rsquo;s functions at assistant secretary level. Details of the delegation of functions under acts other than the Public Service Management Act 1997 are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the practice in his Department relating to the identification for legal and administrative purposes of his Department as an entity separate and distinct from his own legal personality as Minister, indicating whether contracts or other legal rights or liabilities are entered into, accepted or enjoyed in the name of his Department rather than in his own name; if so, the nature of those <Col N="888"/>contracts, rights and liabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department and the office of Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are indivisible in so far as the legalities of contracts or similar legal arrangements are concerned. As a practical matter, contracts may make reference to either or both the office holder of Minister and the Department. However, this does not entail that my Department enjoys or accepts legal rights, liabilities or entitlements distinct from those of the office of Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>, further to Question No. 529 of February 2004, if the draft planning guidelines that he intends to issue to planning authorities whose functional areas include a public safety zone will include a recommendation that the associated restrictions on development be entered in the register of local land charges in like manner to that outlined at paragraph 20 of a UK Department of Transport circular (details supplied).</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The guidelines for land use of zones that have been identified for public safety zones at State airports, which I intend to issue this year, will provide that planning authorities should zone such lands appropriately in their development plans. The system operated in England of registering local land charges or requiring state bodies to purchase lands on which permission for development has been refused in the interests of proper planning and sustainable development is not a feature of our planning code.</P>
