	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am determined to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school. As I said on many occasions, I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results. Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school&rsquo;s performance.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In contrast to school league tables, school inspection reports from whole school evaluations and other inspections, when read in their entirety, can provide balanced and well-informed information on schools. The whole school evaluation process involves an examination of all the varied <Col N="298"/>activities of a school, from the quality of teaching and learning to the availability of extra-curricular activities and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying and health and safety. The inspection process also includes consultation with the school's board, parents and staff members, and at second level, with the school&rsquo;s students. These reports can, therefore, provide valuable information on the educational and social opportunities provided by a school. The comments they contain are fully sensitive to the context in which the school operates in a way that is not possible with league tables.</P>
        <P>Given the breadth of the contents of whole school evaluation reports, the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. The type of information provided will help parents who need accurate and balanced information. They also contain valuable information that will be of interest to schools who may wish to learn from the experience of others.</P>
        <P>I am determined to progress this matter in a sensible and responsible way and to ensure that the views of all the education partners are considered before the publication process is finalised. During the summer, I put in place a mechanism whereby this can take place. The inspectorate of my Department has held no fewer than 20 meetings with interested parties over the past month and is preparing draft guidelines for the publication of inspection reports which will be circulated shortly to the education partners. Responses to the draft guidelines will then be sought and a final draft of the proposals will be submitted to me in December.</P>
        <P>I intend that the publication of school inspection reports will commence from January 2006 for all inspections carried out from the start of the calendar year that year. While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process, the discussions held to date have been fruitful and constructive. Each of the partners realises the need to address the information deficit that exists at present in terms of ensuring full public access to balanced information on schools. This is especially important to those like myself who are opposed to the publication of league tables based on results and want to find a better way. I am confident the considered and responsible approach we are taking to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the progress that will be made by January 2006. The Minister referred to whole school evaluation and other reports. What does she mean by &ldquo;other reports&rdquo;? How far does <Col N="299"/>she intend to go with whole school evaluation reports? I acknowledge what they will contain but I am concerned parents will not be given a clear enough picture. Information about the ethos of a school and boards of management should be included. Witnesses attending the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science highlighted difficulties parents faced in obtaining information from boards of management. I support the concept of whole school reports, as everything will be open, but it is important that parents should have access to all information, including details of results in schools to which they may send their children. I agree that crude league tables should not be developed but information about everything in a school cannot be given to parents if one of the core parts of education, the examination process, is ignored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Whole school evaluation and subject inspection reports will be published. A significant number of subject inspection reports take place each year whereby all the teachers are inspected. These reports will be published, as will thematic inspection reports on, for example, Gaeilge, English and mathematics in the primary curriculum. The chief inspector&rsquo;s report referred to these topics this year. Composite reports will also be published, for example, on Gaeilge in the second level curriculum. These reports will give us a broad view of individual schools and the teaching of subjects throughout the system.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on school ethos and boards of management but the reports take account of the context of the school, which comprises not only its geographic environment or catchment but also the ethos and the situation in which it is working. Many schools are good at issuing brochures and general information that captures that. However, they do not issue information that will be contained in the whole school evaluation reports. The Deputy commented previously about the publication of results. It would be naive to expect that we would not end up with league tables based on results if schools were to publish their results but schools have become open in their dealings with parents and parents, rightly, are demanding of schools regarding the information they provide. I hope, by going down this road with the Department providing the information it has nationally, which is professionally compiled in conjunction with schools, the schools will be encouraged to provide extra information of value to parents. They should not, however, provide information on results.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ways and means to prevent the publication of crude league tables. However, I refer to the &ldquo;rate my teacher&rdquo; fiasco earlier this year. Has the Minister considered giving a role and a say to students in the publication <Col N="300"/>of the various reports so that a positive environment can be created for them to give their opinions on what is happening as distinct from publishing anonymous ratings on a website?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the central parts of the whole school evaluation of second level schools is the involvement of students, who will meet inspectors and fully participate in the process. This reinforces the fact it is a whole school evaluation because it involves everybody. I look forward to the valuable process that will commence in January.</P>

        <Quest>if, in the wake of recent comments at the Joint Committee on Education and Science, she will carry out a full review of school bus catchment areas and boundaries; if she will make a decision in terms of recommendations made as a result of such a review in view of the fact that no full review has been made since 1969 and that children are still without seats in several parts of the country following the welcome ending of the three for two scheme; the effects the short timeframe has had on thousands of parents in planning school transport for their children in August and early September 2005; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
        <P>Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. They also facilitate the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to access their nearest schools.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to hold a general country-wide review of catchment boundaries. A review of specific catchment boundaries in particular areas can, however, be appropriate in certain circumstances. A number of these has been carried out over the years where, for example, a new <Col N="301"/>post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or where a sole provider school closes due to declining enrolment.</P>
        <P>The area development planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the commission on school accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An area development plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an area development plan requires such adjustments.</P>
        <P>Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a very useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.</P>
        <P>With regard to the phasing out of three for two seating arrangements, Bus &Eacute;ireann has indicated that only 31 out of a total of 2,500 post-primary services are now operating on the basis of a seating capacity in excess of one for one. This represents rapid progress and the end of term deadline for full implementation should be met. At primary level, I expect that one for one seating arrangements will be in place by December 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister of State has refused to carry out a full catchment boundary review in view of the fact that boundaries were established in the 1960s and that significant demographic changes have subsequently taken place. There is neither rhyme nor reason to many of the catchment boundaries currently in existence. In terms of population, some areas have grown enormously since the 1960s but there have been no changes to their catchment boundaries. The entire system is a monument to <i>ad hoc</i> provisions. I ask her to review her decision on the matter.</P>
        <P>I have raised the specific concerns of Pallaskenry, County Limerick on a number of occasions. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for organising a meeting between parents and representatives of the Department last Friday. Was any decision made subsequent to the meeting, which lasted for approximately three hours? What is the status of the letter sent by the Department in 2001 that explained that the <i>status quo</i> would remain and the bus would continue to come from the city side until the catchment boundaries were changed?</P>
        <P>I have before me a list of feeder schools to a Limerick city school which comprises a greater number of schools from without the city&rsquo;s catchment boundary than from within. Feeder schools are located in Counties Clare, Tipperary and Limerick. A statement was made that the school bus is being discontinued because there are <Col N="302"/>sufficient places within the city. I put it to the Minister of State that many of these places are being taken by children who live outside the city&rsquo;s catchment boundary. I ask that the situation in Pallaskenry be reviewed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments of my colleague, Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, with regard to Pallaskenry. I will not go over old ground because of time constraints. I hope that following the meeting this matter will be resolved. I ask the Minister and Minister of State to make themselves aware of other situations throughout the country. While it appears nothing will be done for this year, the possibility of doing something next year must be examined.</P>
        <P>The Minister said that where school closures arise they will be examined and dealt with. In 1969, men were sent to the moon with less computer power than I have in my phone, and there has been much tinkering with computers since then. The Minister said that while she would not necessarily make any changes on the basis of new school populations or people wanting more choice, she did acknowledge the possibility that she could make changes following a full scale review. Will the Minister carry out a review with a view to making her own decision on it? There is no harm in carrying out a review, the first since 1969. She is in Government and can decide to disregard any report but such a review is crucial at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Deputy Gogarty&rsquo;s questions first, I am a little confused by his questions because I made it clear in the Joint Committee on Education and Science the week before last that I would not initiate a general review of the catchment boundaries. People may say that such boundaries were introduced in the 1960s when times were very different and that a change was needed but we must examine the reasons for their implementation.</P>
        <P>The boundaries were implemented because of the introduction of a very different education system where post-primary education was available to all but it also refers very much today in that these boundaries are in place to ensure there is a proper strategic approach to planning and accommodation throughout the country when it comes to school buildings. In terms of school transport, therefore, people may believe that changes in boundaries might alleviate some problems that may exist but many more Members would complain of difficulties with people not being eligible under the new system. Obviously it would have consequences for any change but the main reason for having the boundaries in the first place is to ensure proper school planning and accommodation.</P>
        <P>We must ensure also that the boundaries protect declining schools, so to speak, as well as rural <Col N="303"/>schools because if poaching were allowed to occur in those situations, we would see the decline of certain schools. The boundaries exist to protect those schools in both rural and urban areas. The question of teachers also arises. These boundaries are in place to ensure we have the right teachers and the correct structures for education. That is the reason I do not propose to change the boundaries system at present.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan referred to demographic changes but as I explained to her in the joint committee, certain changes have been made with regard to the demographics and all the other issues to allow for the provision of new schools or the closure of others in exceptional circumstances. That provision is not <i>ad hoc. </i>If we did not have such a system we would descend into an <i>ad hoc</i> situation and neither I nor the Deputy would want that.</P>
        <P>With regard to the question of Pallaskenry, I had the opportunity of answering that question last year and also the week before last on the Adjournment. I have also answered many questions that were put to me by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan and others in the committee and my decision on that matter stands. There is no reason to extend the debate on that matter because my decision is made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>To return to the question of <i>ad hoc</i> provision, I will give an example from my area. Many of the children coming from areas outside the Limerick city catchment have bus tickets. The same must be true in other parts of the country. The transport liaison officer in each county makes these decisions in which many parents see no logic. They do not know why one child receives a ticket and another does not.</P>
        <P>This problem will be worse next year. I urge the Minister of State to consider the question again. It has caused much trauma this year and will cause more next year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the status of the letter of 2001 to the Salesian college, Pallaskenry, to the effect that the <i>status quo</i> would prevail until the catchment boundaries were reviewed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Department of Education and Science ruined the summer holidays of many parents and children. Parents in Limerick, Galway, Sligo and other parts of the country now have to drive a child in a car, and chase a bus.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State says there is no need to change the system that exists to protect a certain <i>status quo</i>. Between the 1970s and 1990s new education models were introduced, including educate together, Gaelscoileanna, and community colleges, which changed the educational system. Rather than stick plasters here and there, the Minister of State needs to take a holistic approach to the system, then based on the finance <Col N="304"/>available decide who will and will not suffer. The system is patently unfair and does not take cognisance of the society in which we live.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Deputy&rsquo;s views. He used the word &ldquo;panic&rdquo;. There was certainly unnecessary reaction but I do not blame the parents for that. Much of it was politically whipped up because these false rumours&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not fair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>This happens every year because it takes time for the eligible pupils to apply for, and receive, their tickets. There are eligible pupils who have yet to apply for their tickets. Until we know the exact position, the catchment areas, including the catchment boundary pupils, cannot be facilitated because they are concessionary pupils. The eligible pupils must be facilitated first.</P>
        <P>The only difference between this year and last year is that we accommodated a situation and very quickly improved the seating arrangements on buses in order to have a one for one arrangement. No matter how people view that change, everyone in this House believes it was a priority. It seems to surprise Members on the other side of the House that this is being done quickly.</P>
        <P>The catchment boundaries are not <i>ad hoc</i>. They exist to ensure there is a strategic approach to school accommodation and the provision of teachers. It is most important that we take that into account. There have been certain changes on catchment boundaries, as I have explained, with regard to new schools or where schools have closed.</P>
        <P>There was an interesting example of this in County Wicklow. In September 2003 Kilcoole opened as a sole provider for the area of Kilcoole-Newtownmountkennedy and environs. The level of accommodation provided was based on the projected enrolment, and primary schools within revised catchment areas. Discussions took place with other post-primary schools in determining the provision. It was decided to continue to provide transport only to pupils who had already commenced post-primary education.</P>
        <P>That is happening already in Pallaskenry because I have allowed it as a particular concession to that school.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>when a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children and vulnerable adults will be established; when all personnel with access to children and vulnerable adults in the education system will be subject to vetting by <Col N="305"/>the Garda central vetting unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27797/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, for parents, for agencies that work with children and for society generally and I assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</P>
        <P>In improving our child protection procedures, the Government has focused on extending the capacity of the Garda vetting unit to ensure greater availability of vetting checks for employers who want to check the background of prospective employees.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for Garda vetting, I am happy to outline the progress being made in the expansion of the service.</P>
        <P>My colleague Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has already announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November this year. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults, including teachers and caretakers.</P>
        <P>In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of requests for clearance from my Department regarding bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children, and to staff working in children&rsquo;s detention schools.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that, irrespective of whatever additional arrangements may be introduced in this area in future, criminal record checks, while in the appropriate circumstances being capable of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for posts.</P>
        <P>There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice, both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice and checking references, and to ensure adequate supervision arrangements after recruitment.</P>
        <P>The issue of establishing a non-Garda, employment-related vetting register to provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults in the health and education sectors is also being considered. A working group made up of representatives from the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health <Col N="306"/>and Children is carefully considering the best way forward in that respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has said this is a key concern for the Government. However, it has not taken any action to show that. She stated that a working group is examining this issue, but last year another working group reported on the same issue. Is this working group in addition to the last one?</P>
        <P>I accept that the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced almost a year ago that he would double the staff of the central vetting unit, but they have still not come on stream. I am sure the Minister is aware that a convicted sex offender operated as a school bus driver in County Laois this year. What checks has her Department and she carried out to ensure that the same thing is not happening elsewhere? That is the most important point.</P>
        <P>When does the Minister intend to make the necessary legislative changes to ensure that we establish a register of persons considered unsafe to work with children? They are still listed in section C of the legislative programme. I accept the Minister&rsquo;s point, which I also made in the House when Fine Gael debated this issue two years ago this December. We were told that progress was being made. We are very close to the second anniversary of that debate, which sadly coincided with the case of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in England. Unfortunately, the Minister has yet to take this issue seriously and ensure that something of that sort could not happen here. I ask her to outline to the House when she intends to prioritise those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The difference between the two working groups was that the first set out recommendations, and the second is deciding how to implement them. It is very much an action group, being chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and has representatives of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Finance, as well as the Office of the Attorney General and the chief executive officer of the ISPCC. It is targeted at implementation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The decision was taken on the recommendation of the working group to go ahead with doubling the numbers of staff employed by the vetting unit. That was a very practical way of ensuring that people could get the clearance. That will occur from mid-November and will offer a service to children and other vulnerable groups. Like the Deputy, I was appalled at what happened in Laois, where it was reported a convicted sex offender operated as a school bus driver. We understand that the private contractor changed the driver on the service without informing Bus &Eacute;ireann, something that it is required to do under the terms of its contract. Bus &Eacute;ireann immedi<Col N="307"/>ately rectified the situation. Not only was the driver immediately withdrawn from the service, but the contract with the firm concerned was also terminated. The action taken proves that the children&rsquo;s safety is the priority.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The legislation regarding a register was always designed to be implemented on a cross-Border basis so that it would cover the entire island, owing to the movement of people from one jurisdiction to another. This is the way it should progress because that hiatus remains in our cross-Border working arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The system in place in Northern Ireland is effective. The authorities there have not allowed the inadequacies of the system in the South to delay them in implementing developments in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Our aim is to establish a register that will cover both jurisdictions. Progress can be made in this regard when the Northern Ireland system is back on track and a full working relationship between authorities on both parts of the island is restored. In the meantime, the vetting unit will be doubled in size and will be capable of vetting increased numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>The Northern Ireland system is very much on track. It may not function on an all-island basis but it is unfair to suggest it is not on track. The Minister has not answered one of my questions. Has she instructed all bus operators to ensure that the situation which arose in Laois cannot recur elsewhere?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One hopes it cannot recur but we are dealing with a situation involving a number of bus companies, private contractors and large numbers of individual drivers. The important issue is that Bus &Eacute;ireann will, on our behalf, ensure the correct procedures are put in place. Where issues have come to light, the company has dealt with them efficiently.</P>
        <P>I did not mean to imply that the system in Northern Ireland is not working well. My point is that cross-Border co-operation in this regard is not effective. Progress will be made on this when the cross-Border bodies are functional once more.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. A report on the circumstances of the case has been requested from Bus &Eacute;ireann, which organises the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. When this report has been received, the Department will advise the Deputy of the position.</P>
        <P>In regard to the general administration of the school transport scheme, Bus &Eacute;ireann issues tickets or travel permits to pupils who have been approved for transport on a service. In addition to specifying the pupil&rsquo;s name, the pick-up and set-down point and the period of validity, the permit specifies that pupils must carry tickets at all times when travelling to and from school. In addition, the invoice issued by Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of tickets specifies that only those pupils in possession of a valid permit will be carried on a transport service. In line with transport systems in general, this is deemed to be the most appropriate method of identification and allows drivers and other personnel to control travel and regulate loadings.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am advised by Bus &Eacute;ireann that listings of pupils who have been issued with tickets for the current term will be issued to bus operators in mid-October. Such an arrangement is not possible in the case of pupils who avail of scheduled public transport services. The issue of listings at an earlier date is not possible due to the number of late applications and late payments received in school transport offices throughout the country. It would be of little benefit issuing such lists until Bus &Eacute;ireann is satisfied the vast bulk of tickets have been issued and that the listing represents a true reflection of all pupils who are authorised to travel.</P>
        <P>More than 134,000 pupils are carried by in excess of 3,000 vehicles under my Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme. In view of the recent focus on safety measures for school transport and the obvious administrative burden in operating a scheme of this size, the Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring only those pupils who have been approved transport can avail of the service and that additional pupils who may compromise safety measures are not carried.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply. A situation whereby a child is left on the side of the road, with the consequent risks to his or her safety, is tantamount to criminality, according to the headmaster of Ramsgrange community school. When does the Minister of State expect the report on this incident to be published? I presume she does not have the details of this particular case but the point of major concern for parents is that a child should be abandoned on a roadside. According to media reports, the driver knew that the child in question had a ticket but had forgotten it that morning.</P><Col N="309"/>
        <P Just="Left">What assurances can the Minister of State give parents that this will not happen again? The school transport scheme caters for more than 130,000 children but we must focus on those cases in which problems have arisen. When will the report on this incident be available? What assurances can the Minister of State give parents who leave their children to the bus that they will actually get on the bus? Is there any assurance that such an incident will not happen again? Has the Minister of State met Bus &Eacute;ireann on this case and laid down a marker for the future that no child should be left on the side of the road? Parents have enough concerns about their children going to school without this extra concern. I was contacted by a number of families who were concerned the same would happen to their child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s concern and am aware of the case. I look forward to hearing from Bus &Eacute;ireann when its report is to hand.</P>
        <P>On the operational matter, there is a practical difficulty for drivers in many cases because they may not necessarily be able to identify all the children. Bus operators operate on a panel system of nominated drivers and are interchangeable. Therefore, they may not necessarily know the identity of all pupils. As I said in my reply, the child must have a ticket to travel which must be in his or her possession. The invoice issued by Bus &Eacute;ireann states that a child can only travel if he or she has a ticket. I have been asked if there is a possibility of providing a list which could be made available to the drivers. The drivers could immediately check the list and that might circumvent these issues.</P>
        <P>While that is one way of dealing with the issue, there can be a number of problems with that system in that a large number of late applications and those who are eligible and make late payments cause difficulties. Although they are eligible, they may not have made an application or if they have made an application, they have not paid. Therefore there is a delay at the beginning of a term which causes difficulty. Perhaps we should look at the question of a timeframe for receipt of applications by the Department. A list system is of little use unless the bulk of the children have tickets and the names are available. I am informed that the names for this term will be available in mid-October which is any day now.</P>
        <P>Some 10,000 pupils travel on various types of scheduled services for whom it would not be feasible to have listings. However, I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point seriously. We are having discussions with Bus &Eacute;ireann &mdash; we have regular positive contact with it &mdash; to consider specific operational matters, especially the operation of tickets, with a view to seeing what can be done in a case such as that outlined by the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has approved the drafting of the institutes of technology Bill to transfer responsibility for the day-to-day management of the institutes of technology sector from my Department to a reconstituted Higher Education Authority. This will facilitate the gradual devolution to the institutes of technology of greater academic and managerial autonomy. This is in line with both the recommendations of the OECD review of higher education in Ireland and with Government policy which aims to create a unified strategy within the higher education sector while maintaining the differentiation of mission between the institutes and the universities.</P>
        <P>While I have acknowledged that further structural reform of the Higher Education Authority will be necessary to ensure it is properly placed to implement the type of changes proposed by the OECD report, I have also made it clear that the final shape of future policy proposals for the sector will take account of the views of those working in and with it. To this end, my Department is engaged in a wide process of consultation with all interested parties to ensure any such restructuring takes place in the context of a wide-ranging, reform-driven strategic policy for the sector as a whole. The ongoing development of this policy is one of my key priorities and will underpin the wider national agenda, which aims to place Ireland at the very forefront of the emerging global knowledge economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the legislation is to be published shortly and that the changes to be made will be both wide-ranging and reform-driven. Does the Minister have a timeframe for completing the legislation? Has the Minister decided that university and IT structures will come under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority as it currently exists? Alternatively, does she plan to go further, as the OECD recommendations did, in having a tertiary education authority? It may be that the name rather than the function is different and if that is so, it does not really matter. However, I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention is to publish the legislation during this session so I hope it will be <Col N="311"/>enacted next year. I also hope to do the transfer next year so the institutes of technology come under the HEA. The period of office of most of the membership of that board will expire at the end of this month, but under the new legislation it will have to be reformed. It is my intention to ensure that the new appointments will reflect some of the needs of the institutes of technology to prepare them for full membership status.</P>
        <P>In the immediate future, it will still probably be called a higher education authority because that it what it is. The real benefit for the institutes is that they will get away from the firm hand of the Department and will have more flexibility in their governance and management. To be fair to them, the institutes are ready for that and I think it will work well. At the same time, we are requesting all the institutes and universities to collaborate on restructuring and reforming. We want to create institutes and universities that are recognised as being world class. The best way we can do that is not by duplicating their work but by ensuring that they can maximise the best of their talents and expertise. All that can come about by having them under the one authority.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the number of children failing to make the transition from primary to secondary education for the most recent year for which statistics are available; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[27579/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no up-to-date research on the number of children who do not transfer from primary to post-primary education on an annual basis. My Department is currently planning the development of a primary pupils database, which will facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future. Together with the current post-primary pupil database, this will allow much improved tracking of where children go after primary school.</P>
        <P>Given the clear link between early school leaving and continued socio-economic disadvantage in adult life, the Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to complete their education. To this end, we are providing increased resources for schools in disadvantaged areas to improve their school completion rates by offering extra supports for their students. These include extra educational supports and services such as breakfast clubs and homework supports. Working with parents to promote school attendance is also an important part of the work of the home school <Col N="312"/>community liaison officers appointed to our disadvantaged schools.</P>
        <P>Other measures designed to improve school completion include the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board in 2002. The priority the Government attaches to tackling early school leaving is evident from the fact that the budget for the welfare board has been increased by 20% in 2005. In addition, &euro;24 million is being provided this year for the school completion programme, a key element of which is developing strong links between primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>Under the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, which I launched in May, additional supports are being targeted at children in the most disadvantaged schools to encourage them to stay in school. The key principle of early intervention to identify and help children at risk of leaving school early is a major component of the plan.</P>
        <P>Under DEIS, a continuing emphasis will be placed on the development of effective transfer programmes for pupils making the transition to second-level, by building on the existing work of the HSCL scheme and the school completion programme in this area. Initiatives such as familiarisation days and week-long transfer programmes for new entrants to second level have been shown to have positive results in helping children to make a smooth transition to their new school. I am anxious that a strengthening of such programmes be prioritised under the new action plan.</P>
        <P>Primary teachers can help their post-primary colleagues to be aware from the start of difficulties facing particular children and how to help them to settle into post-primary school and minimise the risk of them dropping out. All primary and post-primary schools in disadvantaged areas must work in close partnership if we are to ensure that the transition from first to second level is as smooth as possible for all children and that support for such partnership is provided under the DEIS programme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a deadline for completing the database of students in sixth class? The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor frequently referred to this matter so we are anxious for it to proceed.</P>
        <P>From her review of disadvantage, the Minister will be aware that each year 1,000 children fail to make the transition, a figure which has grown in recent years. The Minister spoke about changes. What changes does she intend to make to ensure that the programmes in place are working and that the best programmes are kept? We should consider how programmes that are not working can be changed so that they will work.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the National Educational Welfare Board. The board&rsquo;s average caseload of 185 cases per educational welfare <Col N="313"/>officer means it is carrying out a fire brigade action as opposed to being more interactive and noticing the problems in schools that lead to children failing to make the transition and children at second level dropping out. In the upcoming Estimates, will the Minister consider increasing the budget for the National Educational Welfare Board to allow it carry out its full role and not simply deal with children after they have dropped out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I am reluctant to give a timescale for completion of the database, it is a priority for the Department, not only because of the valuable information but also because it will substantially reduce the workload for school principals. We are keeping the matter under constant review. We have no evidence to show that the numbers transferring from first to second level has increased as the Deputy stated.</P>
        <P>Projects such as home school liaison and the school completion programme are having a great effect. Other projects which work very well and which we will continue under the DEIS are the pre-school, the in-school and the after school programmes. The school completion programme also offers holiday time support during mid-term break, organising activities and educational experiences for the children. Many outward-bound programmes mix sporting and cultural activities, literacy and numeracy programmes and include art, drama and music.</P>
        <P>We are spending &euro;24 million this year alone, a substantial investment in programmes to encourage children to stay in school and make the transfer. Schools are working closely on a regional basis with clusters of second level and primary schools linking together.</P>
        <P>The work of the NEWB cannot be seen in isolation and must be seen in the context of all the other work that is ongoing with school completion. We need a carrot and stick approach, not just the stick alone. A question for reply later today deals with its budget. A service is available to every county, which represents a major improvement in the three years since it was established.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Enright in her call for more funding for the National Educational Welfare Board, which is under stress to carry out its statutory duty. I am somewhat surprised that the Minister does not have up-to-date information. Under the Education (Welfare) Act, the National Educational Welfare Board should have such information available. If this is not the case is it because the board is under resourced? It has a direct role in ensuring that children transfer from primary to second level.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister focus on children who drop out in the early years, particularly in the first year of second level education? Anecdotal evidence <Col N="314"/>seems to suggest that many children cannot hack it at second level because they do not have the atmosphere and support available at primary level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy mentioned the very real issue of children dropping out after first year. The Economic and Social Research Institute analysed the experiences of first year students in post-primary education in 2004 and highlighted the children at risk. Arising from this analysis we are targeting particular effective transfer programmes. This year I allocated an additional 100 guidance counsellors to schools, 60 or 70 of whom have already been appointed with the remaining number to go to the designated disadvantaged schools at the top of the list following the survey. I have specifically asked that their work should target the transfer, the children coming into first year and junior level students, not just those in fifth and sixth year, to ensure they are getting the support.</P>
        <P>The work the school completion programme is doing is also being concentrated on those children so they make the transfer. We hope once we have the database, that will make it easier to get the kind of information needed in certain areas. We do not have national data and it is wrong to simply keep estimating. We need the evidence. The Deputy is correct but I am satisfied there have been major improvements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister accept that quite a few children drop out early from second level because they have not got the proper reading and writing skills and that intervention may be necessary at an earlier stage? Regarding the proposed review of the designation of disadvantaged schools, I heard in my constituency two weeks ago of a nine year old girl so hungry she could not walk to school. That is a shocking indictment. This occurred in an area of deprivation but it is not a RAPID area or an area designated as disadvantaged. What progress has been made with regard to tackling disadvantage in areas not traditionally designated as disadvantaged?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the DEIS report which I launched, arising from a survey carried out for the Department, will probably begin in December. We recognise there are disadvantaged schools now that were not previously recognised as such. New schools not included in previous programmes have developed in various areas, so they must be included. That investment will involve an extra &euro;40 million over and above current expenditure. It will also involve another 300 additional posts and in the first instance the investment will be targeted quite specifically at urban educational disadvantage which we recognise is a real problem.</P><Col N="315"/>
        <P>The Deputy is right in saying the children who have dropped out of secondary education are those who have had literacy and numeracy problems. I am confident the 5,000 teachers we now have in our primary schools dealing specifically with children with learning difficulties and special needs will target those children. They can be identified and supported at an early age so that their problems can be rectified before they get to second level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is clear evidence that the drop-out numbers have risen. Between 1996 and 1997, 735 children failed to make the transition to second level, and in 2002-03 the figure was 1,004.</P>
        <P>How will decisions be made on the classification of schools in terms of disadvantage? The Minister said the initial focus will be on the urban areas. For one reason or another, there are certain villages in rural Ireland where schools have an equal degree of disadvantage. I would not like to see such schools left behind. Some of the areas involved were not classified as disadvantaged and may need to be now. What process will be in place for the review?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>All schools have responded to the survey which is being independently assessed by the Educational Research Centre. That standardised system will then identify the level of disadvantage. It will draw together a new integrated school support programme building on all the existing supports across the sector. As a result of that identification about 600 primary schools &mdash; 300 urban and 300 rural &mdash; will be included along with 150 second level schools. All those will be in the school support programme that will bring together clusters and groups of disadvantage that we will target. We anticipate the schools involved will know by the end of the school year.</P>
        <P>Schools currently receiving funds under different headings and that do not make it into the top group will hold on to the funding they have but any additional funding will be targeted at the schools that most need it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 20 and 90 together.</P>
        <P>Since 8 April 2003 the State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations. The statistical issues raised by the Deputies have been forwarded to the commission for direct reply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The commission operates a scheme of reasonable accommodations for candidates with special needs at the certificate examinations. The range of accommodations available to candidates includes the use of readers, scribes, tape-recorders, braille, computers-word processors, helpers and extra time, in addition to decisions at school level regarding rest periods, and use of low vision aids, special desks or chairs. It is also open to special needs students to apply to have a part of an examination waived and to be marked out of 100% on the balance.</P>
        <P>Details of the scheme are outlined on the commission&rsquo;s website at <i>www.examinations.ie. </i> Application may be made through the school or VTOS centre or directly to the State Examinations Commission for external candidates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Students who get assistance during their leaving certificate examinations have that noted on their certificates. This matter has been raised with me by several such students. The assistance provided is there merely to help the students complete the exams, but they feel that noting the assistance on the certificates seems to imply they have not done the same examination, or that their certificates may seem to be worth less than those held by students who did not need assistance.</P>
        <P>I know this is a matter for the State Examinations Commission but I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view to see if the practice could be stopped. It is the students who provide the information in examinations. The students involved get only technical assistance, not information. Does the Minister feel this practice of noting assistance on the certificates could be stopped?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the key recommendations by the expert group on the certificate exams which reported in 1989 with regard to reasonable accommodations was that it should be noted on certificates or results if an element or elements of an examination have been omitted, or the method of examining has been altered in a substantial way. The idea was to strike a correct balance between ensuring that candidates with special needs were given every opportunity to demonstrate their levels of attainment and ensuring that no candidate was given an unfair advan<Col N="317"/>tage over other candidates in the same examination.</P>
        <P>Nowhere on the results or the certificate does it say a result was arrived at as a result of a disability or of a particular disability. The idea was to ensure that any special arrangements would not put the integrity, status or reputation of the exam at risk. Provision is made for the students involved but it is ensured that the special arrangements allow the candidate to show his or her achievement and ability. They are not designed to compensate for any lack of achievement. The point is also to ensure that all candidates are treated equally when the certificates are issued.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the indication regarding special assistance being noted on the exam paper going to the examiner. That is fair enough. However, when the person seeks work and another work candidate has a leaving certificate that does not bear a similar indication of special assistance, it leaves it open to the employer to choose the person who did not get assistance though both certificates should be of equal value. Such an indication on a certificate negates that. This matter has been raised with me by a school principal who feels strongly about it. I accept that the report in 1998 addressed the matter but the issue merits further consideration. I ask the Minister to look at it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to ensuring the integrity of the exam and the exam results. I have yet to meet an employer who actually sought to see anyone&rsquo;s exam certificate. A student may have been unable to complete a full section of an exam. He or she for example might not have been able to do the aural or oral section. It would then be indicated on the certificate that such a student was marked out of 100% on the remaining exam sectors, because the student would not have completed all of the exam components completed by other students.</P>
        <P>This is not designed to be insensitive to people. It would be insensitive to place a reference to disability on an exam certificate, but the note on the certificates involved simply explains the exam circumstances. The accommodations currently given are greatly varied in order to meet the needs of a wide variety of students.</P>

        <P>Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 4,500 additional teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. The annual estimated value of the additional expenditure on these posts is more than &euro;200 million.</P>
        <P>In 1996-97, the average class size in our primary schools was 27. It is now 24. In 1996-97 there was one teacher for every 22 children in our primary schools. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State. Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. While there is more to be done to reduce class sizes further, the progress that has been made in this area in recent years should be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>While the average class size nationally has been brought down to 24, I am committed, in line with Government policy, to delivering further reductions in class sizes for children under nine. In achieving the Government target for smaller class sizes, priority must in the first instance be given to children with special needs and those in disadvantaged areas. Under the new action plan for tackling educational disadvantage which I launched last May, more children in disadvantaged schools will be in classes of 20 in the current school year.</P>
        <P>With regard to the number of classes of over 30 in our schools, the general rule is that schools are staffed on the basis of having a maximum class size across the school of 29. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I examine why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is that there is another class in the same school with just 15 pupils or so. Figures on the number of children in classes of over 30 should be interpreted with caution; the average class size in a particular school can be more instructive.</P>
        <P>The number of children in classes of over 30 has halved since this Government took office, major improvements in staffing supports for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas have been put in place and further improvements will be made in the current school year.</P>

	<P>That is like blaming the principal for the class size. Sometimes he or she cannot avoid having such class sizes. Often a school must wait a year to get an extra teacher so the principal <Col N="319"/>has no alternative but to have larger classes. Does the Minister envisage any changes being made to ensure that schools need not wait a full year to get an extra teacher? Can the staffing be based on the current year&rsquo;s intake rather than on the previous year&rsquo;s? This is causing much difficulty.</P>
        <P>This is a commitment in the programme for Government which the Minister has described as a noble aspiration in the past. Does she believe this commitment can be achieved in the next 18 months or will it take significantly longer?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The only way to ensure that schools due to gain a teacher next year gain that teacher now would be by ensuring that schools which are due to lose a teacher next year would lose that teacher now. This is a result of the panel system, whereby schools must take their staff from the panel. That would not be fair either. The current system is probably a good way of dealing with this, as long as there is a good appeals process, which I believe there is.</P>
        <P>The appeals process operates twice during the year, in July and at the end of the first week in October. It ensures that developing schools, for example, schools that have gained huge numbers of pupils, can make their appeal and be given the teachers they require. Other circumstances are also examined. It is particularly important that schools which are developing quickly and taking in large numbers should get the teachers they require immediately. Generally, however, because of the panel system, it is not possible to allocate the extra teachers without also removing the teachers from the schools that are due to lose teachers.</P>
        <P>I intend to continue to work towards reducing class sizes. It was my intention, in the first instance, to do it with disadvantaged schools. We have done that and I will continue this year to reduce class sizes further for those schools.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>The average OECD class size is 21.4 while in Ireland it is 24. We are still above the OECD average. The Minister quoted statistics from 1997, which is the date that is always picked.</P>

	<P Just="Left">However, more of our GDP was being spent on primary and second level education at that time. It has fallen from 5.3% in 1995 to 4.2% of GDP now. Statistics can be used in different ways but that is a worrying figure. In what timeframe will the Minister be able to implement the noble aspiration in the programme for Government regarding class sizes of 21 or fewer for children under nine years old?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="320"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The word &ldquo;noble&rdquo; is being bandied about by the Opposition. Something that is noble is something that is worthwhile and worth achieving.</P>

	<P>We all aspire to something that is noble. To hold the office of Minister for Education and Science is a noble aspiration for many Members and some of us, fortunately, have managed to achieve it. Noble aspirations, therefore, are achieved and I am confident they will be achieved in the future.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note with regard to class size in OECD reports that outcomes in other countries are no better. Quality of education is equally important. Those with the smallest class sizes have not necessarily achieved the highest results either in PISA or in the literacy and numeracy report that we launched last year, where schools with very small classes had, unfortunately, severe literacy and numeracy problems. Exterior conditions, such as family and community conditions, did not facilitate learning outcomes. It is a wider matter than just class size, despite the progress we are making and will continue to make.</P>

	<P>DEIS &mdash; delivering equality of opportunity in schools &mdash; the new action plan for educational inclusion, which I launched last May, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.</P>
        <P>The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 second level schools will be included in the school support programme. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, the Government has increased funding on specific measures at primary and second level to tackle educational disadvantage by some 130%, from &euro;50 million in 1998 to &euro;120 million in the current year. The additional &euro;40 million annual investment under this action plan <Col N="321"/>on full implementation will represent a 33% increase on current expenditure and a three-fold increase in spending in this area since 1998.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The plan addresses the following key issues and needs: improving identification of disadvantage &mdash; a standardised approach will allow the Department to target resources more effectively; increasing early childhood education provision in the most disadvantaged communities; improving supports for pupils with low attainment levels in literacy and numeracy; enhancing procedures for measuring the outcomes achieved from educational inclusion measures; enhancing integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and cross-sectorally; enhancing professional development supports for principals and school staff; and enhancing research and evaluation. The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures being adopted under the new action plan.</P>
        <P>The new action plan represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem, with the new plan adopting a multifaceted and more integrated approach. This is the first time that an integrated educational inclusion strategy has been developed for three to 18 year olds in this country. A crucial aspect of the action plan will be a more developed planning process, implemented through the school development planning initiative, and improved arrangements for measuring progress and outcomes at both local and national level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply but I was hoping for more detail about what will happen in the schools. Will there be a band of schools that will be considered particularly disadvantaged and will they get more resources than the other disadvantaged schools? All Members are aware of schools that have a high level of disadvantage and are struggling to cope with the social problems that exist in the families of the students. I hope they will get extra allocations to what is given to the regular disadvantaged schools.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate further on her proposals regarding early childhood education. A number of schools in very disadvantaged areas have lost both resource and SNA hours as a result of the changes under the weighted system for resource teachers and SNA support. Some of those schools are struggling as a result of this loss. Will the Minister examine this matter and consider restoring resource hours to those schools? It is a shame that schools that really need extra support do not have it or have lost it this year. However, I welcome the fact there are finally proposals on educational disadvantage. They were a long time coming.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="322"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that schools have lost under the model for the allocation of teachers for special needs. For the first time, there is a permanent allocation for every school in the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some have lost what they had last year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past, these resources were allocated on an <i>ad hoc</i> rather than a permanent basis. Now they are permanent.</P>
        <P>On the question of schools which are deemed to be disadvantaged under this system, the allocation is one to 80 for the most disadvantaged schools. This would change immediately for those schools once the survey has been completed, which is anticipated to be by the end of this year.</P>
        <P>I fully accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point about urban educational disadvantage and I am grateful for her support on this matter. The Department will target the 150 urban town school communities with provision for early childhood education and class size reductions to 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes to avoid the children experiencing a big jump between these levels, as has been the case in some of the schools. More teacher support will be provided for the rural schools and clustering will help with school community links and literacy and numeracy measures.</P>
        <P>As regards the early childhood provision, we want to ensure that duplication is avoided in the case where a very good service is already provided. The co-ordination required will create a link between the schools and community childcare facilities to ensure an education input. As a result of the investment in capital infrastructure in the past number of years some excellent facilities are in place around the country, particularly in the disadvantaged areas but we wish to ensure a good educational input into these facilities.</P>
        <P>When the programme was launched I circulated both the full report and the summary report but I will be glad to provide the Deputy with another copy if required.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>How will the classification be done this time? What will be the criteria compared to when it was first done?</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the subject of rural disadvantage, in certain areas of rural Ireland parents for one reason or another are choosing to take their children out of the bigger village school and move them to schools which are in a rural rather than an urban setting. These schools then need extensions but the village school is left with the disadvantaged students. I refer to a school which accommodated 250 pupils and currently has fewer than 70 students. Will such schools with low numbers be included in the scheme? This is a different type of disadvantage but it is becoming more apparent.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="323"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Educational disadvantage is the issue. Some counties are the first to declare their economic or social disadvantage but it is often the case that students from these counties show participation rates in third level education that are among the highest in the country. I cite County Leitrim to prove my point. It has the highest rate of participation in third level education in the country yet we have all seen programmes in which people talk about its isolation or disadvantage and, therefore, I no longer accept that argument. I wish to focus on the issue of educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>The survey undertaken was very comprehensive and it has been returned by the schools. We will ensure that the size of school will not be a deciding factor but rather the concentration of disadvantage within the school. Clustering will ensure those schools do not lose out. A teacher or a co-ordinator will work with a group of schools to ensure they benefit from the extra facilities which will be put in place. I envisage this scheme will be in place by the end of this year and that it will also include home-school liaison, which is crucially important in tackling disadvantage by linking in with the families. The small school to which the Deputy has referred might be involved in a sharing of facilities.</P>
        <P>I have a problem with people taking their children out of schools in towns and sending them out to the rural areas. The schools in the towns are losing teachers while the rural schools are under pressure and are requesting extensions. One school is as good as the next; the buildings do not make a difference but rather the quality of the teaching. People should be loyal to the school nearest to where they live.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by Bus &Eacute;ireann, which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department, that listings of pupils who have been issued with tickets for the current term will be issued to bus operators in mid-October. Such an arrangement is not possible in the case of pupils who avail of scheduled public transport services.</P>
        <P>The issue of listings at an earlier date is not possible due to the number of late applications and late payments received in school transport offices throughout the country. It would be of little benefit issuing such lists until Bus &Eacute;ireann is satisfied that the vast bulk of tickets have been <Col N="324"/>issued and that the listing represents a true reflection of all pupils who are authorised to travel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the point made by the Minister of State. It is obvious that lessons have been learned from what happened last week and the manner in which the system has operated this year. The Minister of State referred to timescales in an earlier reply. Will the Minister of State give serious consideration to a reply deadline as one means of resolving this matter? This could be one way of resolving the matter but it would need to be publicised so that people were aware of the regulations and did not lose out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to this matter in my reply to Priority Question No. 5. One of the reasons for the delay in the issuing of a list is that not all of those eligible for transport have applied and paid for that transport. The use of an early reply system could be one solution and this is under consideration. I am in discussion with Bus &Eacute;ireann to examine these operational difficulties.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 54 together.</P>
        <P>The task force on student behaviour will complete a final report, including recommendations, later this year. At the interim report stage, the task force decided to document the broad areas emerging and which have recurred with such frequency within its work to date and which in its opinion are representative of the central issues of concern. The task force anticipates that these will form the bedrock of its recommendations in its final report which is expected in December 2005.</P>
        <P>In its interim report the task force recognises that the most important feature of its work is to generate a set of recommendations that will impact in a positive way and will help to curtail the spread of disruptive behaviour in our schools. Since the task force was established early this year, it has really come to grips with the breadth and complexity of this vitally important area. In tackling its job it has consulted widely and built upon submissions, research and its own analysis to sharply define the areas where its final report will make recommendations to underpin future change.</P><Col N="325"/>
        <P>I am particularly impressed with the ability of the task force to focus on the core issues. It has indicated to me that it is on target to produce a final report and detailed recommendations in December of this year. Before producing that report it wishes to engage further with the wide range of interests in this area and to review domestic and international successes and failures. I am greatly encouraged by this interim report and I am very grateful to Dr. Maeve Martin. I look forward to receiving the final report and its recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister intend to implement the final report when it becomes available at the end of this year? Does she envisage implications for resources with regard to its implementation? The problem of particularly disruptive students has been identified in the interim report. There is a need to provide facilities for pupils who genuinely are unable to settle in regular schools.</P>
        <P>I refer to a recent television programme about a school in County Waterford where children who had dropped out of schools were being catered for in an alternative programme which seemed to be working very well. I am aware of a small number of similar schools in other parts of the country which cater specifically for children who do not fit in to the regular school system. Does the Minister intend to expand the availability of such resources or does she envisage that the majority of children can be catered for within the regular post-primary school system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The great advantage of this report is that it has examined both the negative and the positive evidence in schools showing the manner in which schools manage disruptive behaviour. There are some excellent examples of good practice. I expect the final report will focus on issues such as school culture, the code of behaviour, the means by which students are given a voice, the sense of community and communication between the partners. Schools will require structures to deal with the wide range of students. The task force has examined domestic and international examples of how good student behaviour is fostered and examples of good classroom management.</P>
        <P>A wide range of options must be considered and I look forward to the recommendations in that regard. I also suspect that there will be recommendations relating to very disruptive students, who are a very small minority but who are causing problems for some schools. The task force has indicated that it may recommend a type of break-out centre. I hope such a centre would not operate on a permanent basis but would be run with a view to ensuring that children can be reintegrated into school. I accept that not every school is suitable for every child and perhaps <Col N="326"/>some training and youthreach programmes should be in place as alternatives for students. I look forward to the recommendations and I anticipate that there will be resource implications stemming from them. In so far as possible I will work with the partners to implement the recommendations because I believe they will cover not just what needs to be done from a resource point of view or in terms of national implementation, but also with regard to classroom management and so forth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>In its interim report the task force noted that many schools are frustrated with section 29 of the Education Act and it has made some recommendations relating to that section pending publication of the full report. There is a genuine difficulty in schools in that they are being forced to accept for re-admission students whom they have expelled or who have been expelled from other schools for seriously disruptive behaviour. It is causing a difficulty within the system when students are seriously disruptive. If the task force recommends changes to section 29, will the Minister examine that option?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Schools have indicated to me that they have a problem with section 29. However, it should be noted that of all the appeals lodged under section 29, two thirds are resolved in favour of the school and only one third in favour of the students. Schools seem to have the idea that the appeals system is always against them but in reality, that is not the case. I have already indicated that I would be prepared to amend section 29 or to deal with issues around it, perhaps on the procedures &mdash; whatever the task force recommends. Dr. Maeve Martin indicated in June that the task force would not look at section 29, but I asked her to do so because it had been highlighted to me as an issue. I am prepared to look at anything that will support the learning environment for students in a classroom and the teaching environment for teachers.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
        <Quest>the extent to which she will increase the numbers of resource, remedial, special needs teachers or special needs assistants in line with increased requirements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Enormous progress has been made in recent years in increasing the number of teachers in our schools who are specifically dedicated to providing education for children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>At primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>At second level, there are approximately 1,599 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 such teachers in place in the 1997-98 school year.</P>
        <P>At this stage there are approximately 6,304 whole-time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in our primary and second level schools supporting children with special needs. The National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing any applications for additional SNA support that may be received from schools.</P>
        <P>I will continue to prioritise the issue of special needs education and, in co-operation with the National Council for Special Education, ensure that all children with special needs are adequately resourced to enable them to meet their full potential.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>There were a number of difficulties relating to the implementation of the special education needs programme over the <Col N="329"/>summer and with the flow of information to teachers. These difficulties have largely been dealt with now, but it is important that systems are put in place to ensure that such problems do not recur.</P>
        <P>In terms of the special education system overall, does the Minister intend to ensure that the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, reaches its intended complement and how does she intend to ensure that every child who needs an assessment from NEPS receives one? The waiting lists are quite severe and schools in some areas are not covered by NEPS at all. How does the Minister intend to tackle that issue, to ensure that children are assessed?</P>
        <P>I am aware that the system has changed recently and that not all children necessarily need a report now. However, there are still many children who will need a report. Parents go to private psychologists because they cannot get their child assessed by a NEPS psychologist and while they are entitled to do that not every parent can afford a private assessment. Some parents do not fall under the NEPS system because of where their child is located. How does the Minister intend to address this issue?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There are also some children experiencing difficulties despite the fact that they have a report stating that they have a special education need. They are not receiving the service they need under the new system. Will the Minister provide us with figures on the number of parents who have contacted the National Council for Special Education because they are dissatisfied with the fact that their children are not getting the service that expert psychologists have stated they need?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that when we put so many extra teachers in place this summer the system took some time to settle down. I thank the schools for their co-operation and the INTO for its help in implementing this process which has now settled down and is working quite well. I also believe the new circular which was circulated to all schools and which will be sent to all teachers is very helpful because it outlines case studies to assist teachers in coming to a decision regarding a child&rsquo;s education needs. One of the real advantages of the system, which should reduce the need for individual psychologists&rsquo; reports, is the fact that the class teacher, in the first instance, can now identify a child with special needs and ensure his or her needs are met because the teacher is available in the classroom. Over and above that, children with more severe learning difficulties or the low incidence range can continue to get their own personal allocation. Thousands of children throughout the country will continue to be provided with that service.</P>
        <P>There are more than 6,000 special needs assistants to cater for the needs of these children. I <Col N="330"/>envisage that the level of assessments required by individual parents will not now be as great because they will be able to get the service without it. In schools where the National Educational Psychological Service is not available, there is a system whereby the State will purchase the service for children as long as the need is prioritised by the school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I was campaigning for an hour in my city last Saturday, two school principals approached me and told me they were having serious problems. Both principals, who are based in rural villages, had lost the special needs assistant and resource teaching support they had the previous year. These people felt they had been doing a good job looking after children with special needs. However, because of the weighted model, they did not qualify for as much support as they had the previous year. Where one child would have had a full-time special needs assistant, they were now being asked to share an SNA with another child because of decisions of local special educational needs organisers. There are genuine difficulties for schools that are working hard and being all-inclusive in trying to bring as many children as possible with difficulties into their schools. These principals believe they have lost out under the system, which needs to be re-examined.</P>
        <P>In some cases the NEPS psychologists are referring people to the Health Service Executive psychological service. I have come across people who have been told they must wait two years to be assessed within the health service before they will be considered for educational support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As we are running out of time, I will hear very briefly from Deputy Finian McGrath and Deputy McGinley who are offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>As there are a number of one-teacher schools in the country, are there special arrangements to give these schools some form of support in the interests of health and safety? Is it the policy to have such a school manned by one teacher or is it the intention to have someone else in the class if the teacher is unavoidably absent, because otherwise the school will be closed? Is there any arrangement for one-teacher schools or will such schools be left on their own?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept there are still major problems with services for children with disabilities in mainstream schools? Does she accept it is a disgrace and unacceptable in the education system that children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome, for example, should lose their special needs assistants and their parents must ring their Deputies and others to lobby them to get them back? Is it unacceptable that children, particularly primary school children with dis<Col N="331"/>abilities, cannot receive speech therapy services or occupational services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that special needs assistants are provided for children with severe medical or physical needs. I am aware it is the aspiration of most parents that their child should not be dependant on an assistant but should have the skills to be independent in the classroom and to be able to deal with other children. The Down&rsquo;s Syndrome Association said it recognises that every child with Down&rsquo;s syndrome does not need a special needs assistant.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past week, I have spoken to two people with this problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The association said it recognises that every child does not need such a service. I was present and discussing a playground while a child slept on the shoulder of a special needs assistant, which is not good for the development of a child. It is important that the allocation of special needs assistants, working with the SENO, should ensure the service meets the needs of the child as he or she develops. This would give the child the skills to be able to be increasingly independent.</P>
        <P>On the question of one-teacher schools, if the principal teacher in a one-teacher school is unavoidably absent &mdash; some of these schools have just seven pupils, and there are approximately 20 such schools remaining in the country &mdash; they are entitled to a substitute for the day. However, because of the particular situation in regard to the islands this year, I allocated a second teacher to one-teacher schools on the islands because they would not have been able to get a qualified substitute at the time. A special exception was made in this regard.</P>
        <P>In reply to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, an SNA is assigned to a school to meet the needs of a particular child. If that child moves on or if the needs of the child change, the SNA will be redeployed to someone else. As they grow older and gain extra skills, if a child no longer requires the full-time services of an SNA, that person can be shared between children. The local special needs organiser is designed to link in with the parents and the school to ensure the needs of children are being met. It is hoped to reach the stage where they will also link in with the health services.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt there is a difficulty in regard to speech therapists because the local health regions are finding it extremely difficult to recruit them. We have increased the number of people being educated. There are more speech therapists graduating from the colleges. We have doubled the numbers, which I will get for the Deputy.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents or guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement is currently 94, comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers and 61 educational welfare officers. In deploying its service staff, the board has prioritised the provision of services to the most disadvantaged areas and most at risk groups. Five regional teams are in place with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. An education welfare service is available in every county in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The board indicated to my Department that the average caseload of each educational welfare officer as of July 2005 was approximately 164. The board continually reviews the protocols for prioritising children and families who require intervention to ensure that children with the greatest need gain maximum benefit from available resources, and to work with local agencies in prioritising children&rsquo;s and family needs. In this regard, there are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently, work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. I take the point she makes that other people also operate in this area. I am concerned that the limited number of people working in the National Educational Welfare Board do not have time to liaise with the home-school-community liaison officers and all the others involved. The staff are particularly helpful but they engage in a fire brigade response to issues that arise. The chief executive of the board said that further research is needed to examine the detailed reasons behind absenteeism but they do not have the time to carry out this research. Will the Minister provide the National Educational Welfare Board with extra staff so that the root cause for absenteeism can be dealt with rather than responding to individual cases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to have more co-ordination between these services. For example, there are 40 visiting teachers for Travellers. One of the groups with whom the National Educational Welfare Board works closely is Travellers, yet there are 40 people who do nothing else but visit schools where there are Travellers. We must ensure there is not an overlap in this type of work. These services should complement each other.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school completion programme and home-school-community liaison scheme were also mentioned. By working together, they can ensure their work is complementary. It is important that they should examine their workload qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Each scenario is different. However, the educational welfare board was only set up three years ago. It employs 73 full-time welfare officers as well as support staff, which demonstrates our commitment in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>At primary level, physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary <Col N="334"/>school curriculum which was revised in 1999. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced physical education programme for pupils, and includes six broad strands featuring athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics. A programme of in-service training in physical education is being provided between 2004-05 and 2005-06 to support the full implementation of the curriculum in 2006-07. My Department is committed to funding the provision of physical education, general purpose and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the schools&rsquo; capital investment programme.</P>
        <P>A curriculum in social personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory part of all programmes for primary students and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. The programme begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular exercise and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, students will be equipped to take responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy balanced diet and, in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid.</P>
        <P>Measures can be taken to encourage physical activity during school breaks and schools play a major role in nurturing and promoting the involvement of students in sporting activities in the wider community. Sports organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, Basketball Ireland and the Football Association of Ireland provide extensive opportunities for schools to participate in sport.</P>
        <P>The Irish Sports Council, in co-operation with bodies such as the FAI and local sports partnerships, has developed a national Bunt&uacute;s primary schools initiative through which additional supports such as training, resource cards and equipment are provided to support teachers and others in introducing young people to sport and to complement the physical education curriculum. The initiative aims to raise the profile of physical activity and sport, improve in-service training opportunities for teachers, assist governing bodies of sport to develop and deliver appropriate supports for teachers and provide enjoyable and meaningful activity for children which supports the delivery of the curriculum.</P>
        <P>Together, these initiatives ensure children not only get opportunities to exercise at school but also learn about balanced nutrition and making good food choices. Schools are playing their part in the battle to tackle childhood obesity. However, children only spend 20% of their time at school and a healthy home environment is vital to ensuring they do not suffer from obesity.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="335"/>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister consider making physical education compulsory at both primary and post-primary level rather than just recommend it? Has she concerns regarding the training of teachers, given that full-time physical education teachers are not employed at primary level? Has she read the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science which recommends full-time physical education teachers, even on a clustering basis, at primary level? Has she given thought to providing a dedicated period of investment in sporting facilities in primary schools, as was done for information technology in the past?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister share my concern that schools should not be dependent on sports organisations which promote their own sports? The curriculum is broader than that but a number of schools are reliant on sports organisations because of the lack of provision of facilities by the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Schools were asked to use their physical education halls as classrooms under the building programme over recent years when they needed extra classrooms. Has that practice stopped? If not, will the Minister stop it?</P>
        <P>Jamie Oliver was on the airwaves earlier. When will meals be provided in schools as a matter of course, similar to Britain?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I do not envisage Jamie Oliver entering the school system. However, I envisage capital investment in schools, which amounts to &euro;500 million this year, will provide for the construction of new schools and extensions as well as physical education halls and outdoor play areas. For example, outdoor play areas were upgraded under the summer works scheme this year.</P>
        <P>Every primary teacher is being trained in the new school curriculum as part of in-service training. The curriculum is broad so that the needs of girls, in particular, who are reluctant to take up physical education and sports, particularly at second level, can be met. New physical education halls are fitted with fitness suites because they are attractive for girls. We are tackling the issue in a number of ways. However, children spend 20% of their time in schools. Parents need to take responsibility for obesity among their children.</P>

	<P>As I acknowledged previously in the House and in correspondence, Leader&rsquo;s Questions is regarded as one of the more visible and lively features of D&aacute;il sittings enabling topical issues to be raised early in the sitting day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot get answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>In the spirit of the relative spontaneity of the procedure, I have rarely intervened during Leaders&rsquo; Questions. However, in view of the overruns last week, which on a given day may not be uniform and can even create a perceived imbalance, I ask the leaders to co-operate with the Chair in ensuring the time limits laid down by the House are adhered to. It should not be necessary to remind the House that Leaders&rsquo; Questions time is confined to the leaders of Fine Gael, Labour, the designated leader of the Technical Group and the member of the Government responding. All contributions by others are interruptions and are not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week&rsquo;s overruns reflected the gravity of the situation and they were not a waste of time. Having been scalded in the House, I am sure the Taoiseach is glad to be on State business in Downing Street.</P>
      <P>The business of the House last week was dominated by the startling revelation that more than &euro;150 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money had been wasted on a botched project dealing with an information technology system in the health sector which did not work. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, speaking on behalf of the Government, said this sum was a small amount of money.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste has had difficulties in the past being briefed on matters relevant to her Department but I hope she is fully attuned to all the IT issues in the health sector. For example, she will be familiar with the project known as the Irish health services portal, which was to establish a single Internet point of contact for members of the public through which they could access health services throughout Ireland. A contract to develop the portal was awarded early in 2004. Fortunately, on 5 May 2004 the portal was ready for launch and at 6 p.m. that day, after a frenzied photocall staged at 5.50 p.m., the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, launched it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Him again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In the last sentence of his speech, he said, &ldquo;It gives me great pleasure today to launch the Irish national health services portal which can be seen at the stand behind you.&rdquo; The Department of Health and Children followed up this launch by confirming in the document Health Information National Strategy, published in July 2004, that the portal was by then up and running.</P>
      <P>The only problem is that the portal is not up and running. Unfortunately, the portal cannot be <Col N="338"/>seen at the stand behind the T&aacute;naiste or anywhere else because it does not exist. It is not there, it has disappeared and it is an ex-portal. The portal which was created by the press launch of the then Minister, Deputy Martin, has disappeared into the same black hole as e-voting, PPARS, the civic hub, Punchestown and all the others.</P>
      <P>This photocall, which was staged in Cork during the European Ministers&rsquo; meeting at a cost of &euro;3 million, must be the most expensive in the history of the State. Not only has the portal disappeared but the HSE has re-tendered for a new job, called the unified website, which has all the characteristics of the last portal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>A second one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The tender for this was prepared on Friday 30 September and those seeking to submit a tender have a short timeframe within which to complete their business. Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of this project, has she any concerns over the way in which it is being conducted and is she not concerned about the ridiculously short time allowed to tender for this unified website as a successor to the portal that has gloriously disappeared?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the e-portal and work on it was suspended by the HSE last February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That sounds familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The technology may not have been compatible with what was intended. It was originally scoped by Accenture. Incredible as it may seem, surveys in the United States show that only 28% of the technology scoped for works on the first occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a chestnut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste is looking for cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should be exported to America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste without interruption, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The scope for the exercise was completed as part of the information society initiative, which recommended to the Government that services be provided on a single website so that people could learn the health services available in different places. Work was suspended <Col N="339"/>in February and a tender for a smaller project costing less than &euro;250,000 has been advertised.</P>
      <P>I have asked the HSE not to proceed with awarding any tender in this or any other technology area unless it is cleared by the Departments of Finance and Health and Children. That will be the position with regard to all technology projects in the health area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste seems to be setting all standards by reference to the United States, including the privatisation of hospitals. The then Minister, Deputy Martin, in his speech on this matter said, &ldquo;Crucially, it will enable the health services to deliver a consistent message to the public and to its employees&rdquo;. It has gone with the wind.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Is the T&aacute;naiste not concerned over the manner by which this is being advertised? It has been expressed to me by a number of concerned people in the information technology sector that the time allowed for this tender leads to the assumption that this is written for a particular supplier. Will the T&aacute;naiste investigate that?</P>
      <P Just="Left">Will she also familiarise herself with the Butler report, which looked at the health Ireland portal in February and produced a damning critique of it? The report noted that the portal did not have any business sponsor and its writers believed that high level ownership was essential if the project was to continue. The strongest recommendation made was that a sponsor should have been sought at the earliest opportunity. That kind of language is familiar in terms of the reports we have had of PPARS last week.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste made some changes at the Cabinet this morning. Who has political responsibility for this project? Who is in charge and can we take it that she will investigate the short tender time involved and at least clarify that this project is not written with any individual or specific supplier in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect that the people who were in contact with Deputy Kenny have also been in contact with me. As a result of that, I have ordered that the HSE must get the approval of the Departments of Finance and Health and Children before it proceeds to tender on this project. Any information project in the health area which has not already been committed will have to go through a process of thorough evaluation.</P>
      <P>Now that we have a single organisation and somebody with responsibility for information technology and extensive experience in the health area, single lines of accountability will hopefully avoid situations where unnecessary public investment is made in projects that do not satisfy our needs.</P>
      <P>Everybody would acknowledge that it is desirable to have a single site where information can <Col N="340"/>be accessed. Why is it so difficult to be able to specify the technology? Accenture is a reputable company and it completed the scoping. IBM is also a reputable company and it produced the technology. Notwithstanding that fact, the project had to be suspended in February and that is why it has re-tendered. I assure Deputy Kenny that I will ensure that the tender is completed in an open, fair and transparent manner for all participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it correct that every action the HSE has taken since it was established has been to try to stop what Deputy Martin did as Minister for Health and Children? Is that a fair summary of what the T&aacute;naiste has said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste agrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Now, after Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s latest allegation, it is another case of closing the portal after the horse has bolted. There was a time when Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers entered the House for the Order of Business and Leaders&rsquo; Questions. They do not do that anymore, for whatever reason.</P>

	<P>What about the money Deputy Rabbitte made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I ask Deputy Brady to allow Deputy Rabbitte without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the extent of concern that exists about issues arising last week. I will instance from Deputy Johnny Brady&rsquo;s own constituency one of the many people who <Col N="341"/>approached me yesterday in fury about one aspect of this matter, which is that it is not possible to find out what happened, why it happened and who is responsible. The Taoiseach entered the House and denied all responsibility. He said it was not an information technology system, that the allegations were incorrect and misleading and all they were doing was to try to add new ideas but that it went wrong. Nobody will admit what happened.</P>
      <P>What does the T&aacute;naiste know since she took over? How much of this debacle of &euro;160 million was incurred on her watch and how much was the responsibility of her predecessor? Did the decision go to Government? Was the original decision made by Government? Who was in charge of the project? Who made the decision to continue with the expenditure? If the first phase started out at &euro;8.8 million, why did nobody shout stop when it went to &euro;18.8 million, &euro;28.8 million, &euro;38.8 million or &euro;98 million? Who is responsible? Was this matter ever brought back to Government? If a decision was made to extend it from a payroll system to a human resource management system, who made that decision? Were the consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche, given an open-ended cheque? Is there a contract with the company? Has the T&aacute;naiste seen the contract? What does the contract provide for? Was it open-ended in that the company could send in any kind of invoice it liked?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte, your time has concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of its own people did the company send in? How much did it cost to commission premises for them? How much did it cost to produce newsletters? Who was monitoring this project? The Minister is in her position a year. Before it was decided to collapse this system, she must have established to her own satisfaction who is responsible for this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>What can the T&aacute;naiste say?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s first point in regard to my colleague, Deputy Martin, my predecessor as Minister for Health and Children, a hospital information system was being rolled out in a number of hospitals in Cork, Tralee and elsewhere. The cost of that project was going to escalate to approximately &euro;400 million and he put the brakes on it and refused to give any more money towards it at the start of 2004.</P>
      <P>Regarding this particular project, as I said last week, it justified the idea of not having 11 different health boards with 253 members, which was what we had to deliver health services, and demonstrated the need for the Health Service Execu<Col N="342"/>tive. It was long overdue. This is one example, among many others&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is no better now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a lot better. I told the House last week when I became aware there were issues around the PPARS system. Obviously, it did not go to Cabinet. Every matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>A &euro;150 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Estimates go to Cabinet. The Deputy knows that, he has been at the Cabinet table. The health boards made the application for the money to put in a payroll system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The health boards had no involvement in this decision. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor made the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Sorry, Deputy, you are not the leader of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>They were given the money. An evaluation is being done both by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Health Service Executive and the HSE will decide at its board meeting in December whether to continue to roll out this system. It will be a matter for the executive having evaluated its requirements and whether this system can meet its needs but among the difficulties, and I want to acknowledge them, is that there was no fixed price contract with the consultants. It appears that the more they worked, the more they got paid. There was no incentive in the contract for the consultants to deliver a particular project and get paid on the basis of results, which should be normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. J. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Who agreed to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be normal and it should be the case. I am not aware of the number of individuals from this consulting firm who worked on this project but I do know that the amount of money spent on consultancy in this project and in other projects is excessive. That is why the Government decided today to put a new process in place across Departments in regard to both consultancies and information technology. We all have to learn lessons from this experience.</P>
      <P>When I became aware in July that there were concerns about this matter, I spoke to the Secretary General in my Department. He met representatives of the HSE and asked them, on my authority, to ensure that no more staff were put working on this project pending its evaluation, and he asked that the evaluation be completed over the summer. It was completed and that was the evaluation that went to the board of the HSE last week.</P>

	<P>I remind the T&aacute;naiste that this is Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question and in fairness to Deputy Rabbitte, she should not answer any other Deputy&rsquo;s questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Hay Management Consultants carried out a review of this matter in 2002 and said at the time, as the Deputy is aware, that what was envisaged in 1998 and 1999 at £9 million would not be sufficient to do what was required and that it would be at least ten times greater than that. The mistake was that a business case was not made for this technology before we embarked on the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Other than admitting that a business case was not made for the decision in the first place, the T&aacute;naiste has not dealt with any of the questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>She cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is responsible for this matter? She cannot tell the House that the health boards decided that they would embark on this mission. That is not the way it happened. Why does the T&aacute;naiste continue to state that if only she had known about all the differences in practice between the 11 health boards this would not have happened and that this justifies the HSE? How does it justify the HSE? If the health boards were still there, whatever their defects, it is sure that the alarm bells would have gone off before they went off in this particular case, some seven years after the idea was originated. I am sure all of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s colleagues behind her agree with that.</P>
      <P>Everybody who was ever near a health board knows that there were different practices in different health boards, different rates of pay, different systems and so on. Everybody knew that before this project was embarked on. Surely all of that should have been regularised before such an engagement took place. The T&aacute;naiste has not dealt with the question of responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>May I ask her about her statement that she will personally sign off on all consultancies in future? Does that mean she will personally monitor them? Does that mean that we now have a blurring of the lines between policy and operational executive action? Is that Government policy or just Progressive Democrats policy? I note that the Government decision of today to which she referred does not confirm anything along those lines. It states that Ministers will also have to confirm that any moneys spent on consultancy in their Departments is necessary in time for next year&rsquo;s Estimates. Apart from the incompetent English, that does not change anything except that provision must be made in the Estimates, and some Minister cannot decide during the course of the year that he will award an open-ended contract to consultants.</P>

	<P>What do you think, a Cheann Comhairle, the Government decision of this morning will do? The Government will bring in consultants to advise on the type of new system it should operate.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Do I understand the T&aacute;naiste to have said in the reply that there was no contract that fixed any price with the consultants, Deloitte &amp; Touche, or with the consultants brought in to monitor Deloitte &amp; Touche, that it was open-ended and that for as long as they could keep claiming money, money would be paid out by the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte may have been aware of all the practices but very few other people knew that we have 25,000 different work rosters. In some areas in the country, people <Col N="345"/>doing the same job work a different number of hours.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding consultancies, it is the case that as Minister for Health and Children I am accountable to this House for policy, legislative matters and so on in the Department of Health and Children, and the accounting officer for the HSE is Professor Brendan Drumm, whose position we provided for under the new legislation. If I am to answer in this House for the appointment of consultants, I want to be certain that we are only using consultants where it is absolutely necessary. It is good practice, therefore, that a case would be made to me when we are not using the in-house expertise available in the Department. That will be good for the Department and as far as accountability is concerned.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for every Minister to decide how he operates his own Department. It is not a matter for me to tell others what to do in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>According to reports by tribunals of inquiry and by the Comptroller and Auditor General the Government has given rise to some incredible litanies of mismanagement, misspending and sheer waste. I speak not only of the waste of money but also of the waste of human life.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste, as Minister for Health and Children, is aware of the report on alcohol misuse by young people, published in June 2004 by the Joint Committee on Health and Children. She is aware too of a strategic report on the same issue. According to the report of 2004, the cost of alcohol abuse is &euro;2.4 billion per annum. The report states that 80% of this cost could be prevented if public policy measures were in place, and includes a list of policy recommendations.</P>
      <P>Is the T&aacute;naiste serious about any of these recommendations, particularly the key points? The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s predecessor saw the light after years of strong but ineffective messages on cigarette packets, and introduced measures to control smoking. Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that education <Col N="346"/>makes little or no difference in regard to abuse of alcohol and that the environment must be shaped to control alcohol consumption?</P>
      <P>Will the T&aacute;naiste reverse her decision to abandon the alcohol products Bill and act on her predecessor&rsquo;s recommendation to introduce that legislation? Will she advise the Government to introduce random testing as the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, promised? Will she implement the recommendations in the committee report, rather than the voluntary code? What is going on between her and the drinks industry that is so set on this code, which we know will make little or no difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent is correct. Alcohol consumption is a serious problem. The issues, however, are wider than banning alcohol advertising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In many other countries where alcohol is widely advertised, perhaps even more than here, drinking patterns are very different. Therefore we must deal with many of the cultural and educational aspects of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has decided to deal with the advertising of alcohol products by way of a voluntary code. If that does not work we will introduce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not work. How long will the Government wait to find that out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us give it a chance and see. We should not be negative. It will work but if it does not we will bring in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>My question has not been answered. The T&aacute;naiste did not say how long she will give to test this voluntary code. Does she understand the voluntary code is nothing new? It appears the T&aacute;naiste has been duped by the drinks industry. It is regarded as acceptable for 33% of people under the age of 18 to see advertisements for alcohol products on television. The Government is playing Russian roulette with children.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste knows from research in New Zealand and the United States that the earlier children are exposed to alcohol and alcohol advertising the worse the situation is. A third of 16 year olds binge drink every week and Irish girls have the worst record for female binge drinking throughout Europe. Does the T&aacute;naiste realise she is presiding over a situation in which our children are more and more being pickled in a sea of alcohol?</P><Col N="347"/>
      <P>Will the Government put measures in place to control the availability of alcohol? Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure random testing is brought in forthwith, as recommended by her ministerial predecessors, and to which the drinks industry willingly acceded?</P>
      <P>What is stopping the T&aacute;naiste and the Government introducing random testing and the alcohol products Bill, which was promised? Does the T&aacute;naiste not act on the promises made in Government? Will she implement the key recommendations of the 2004 report, to which doctors have agreed, as have Deputy Gormley and other Members of this House? Why is the T&aacute;naiste not introducing those recommendations? The voluntary code is nothing new and will not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Random testing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Transport, is responsible for random testing but he must resolve legal issues first. Subject to those issues being resolved I strongly support this approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gormley&rsquo;s party leader is quite competent to deal with his own questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Sargent makes a strong case for the greater programme in schools in regard to alcohol. The new social and personal health programme aims to help young people develop self-esteem, be more confident and learn to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and to address the role of parents. These issues are important. It is not simply a matter of banning advertising by the industry. If the voluntary code does not work we will legislate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 82 relates to assessors who would assist a tribunal of inquiry into a railway accident in its work. An assessor would typically be an expert in railway safety or some aspect of it, or perhaps a legal expert. I propose in amendment No. 82 that the chief investigator should also be qualified to be an assessor. He or she may well be the best qualified for such a function.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Naughten proposed some restrictions on who should be eligible to chair a tribunal of inquiry into a railway accident. To ensure the impartiality of the chair beyond question, I propose therefore to go further than Deputy Naughten suggested. Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 propose that all serving staff of the commission and investigation unit, including the commissioner and chief investigator, should be barred from chairing a tribunal. All serving and former staff of the railway undertaking involved in the accident should also be barred from the chair. In addition, any other per<Col N="359"/>son with a conflict of interest should be barred. This may include some former staff of the commission.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the position regarding affirmations. When I have tabled similar amendments in the past, the relevant Minister has claimed the issue is dealt with by the Interpretation Acts. That is not the case. The Interpretations Act does not say what everybody seems to imply. It provides that an oath includes affirmation for persons entitled by law to affirm. However, there must be a legal entitlement which is what we are seeking in this amendment. Recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform conceded that point during a debate on another Bill.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) requirements for the maintenance and inspection of railway infrastructure, rail track, permanent way and rolling stock,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) the maximum carrying capacity for both passenger and freight trains,</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) the maximum hours of work and the minimum hours of rest for safety critical staff,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section provides that the commission be given the power to make regulations in a number of areas important to rail safety. What I am seeking is that the commission be allowed make regulations in respect of the maintenance and inspection of railway infrastructure, the permanent way, rolling stock and the rail track. It is strange that aspect appears to have been omitted from the Bill. Also the commission should be allowed make recommendations on the maximum number of hours people would work on railways. There are similar issues in the area of aviation. I understand that for some reason, traditionally, this has been omitted from rail safety legislation. It appears to me that it should be included in a new Bill and also the maximum carrying capacity. There is a point beyond which trains might be considered to be overpacked either with freight or passengers. Will the Minister respond to these points?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s amendment No. 94 I am reluctant to allow the commission make regulations in regard to such matters. It would be a very prescriptive approach to tell railway undertakings how often they should inspect and maintain their infrastructure and trains. Railway undertakings are in the best position to know how often such inspections and maintenance need to be done to <Col N="362"/>ensure safety. The primary duty of care under this Bill is placed where it rightfully belongs on the railway undertaking. This principle is enshrined in the EU railway safety directive adopted in 2004. A railway undertaking knows best the condition of its infrastructure and trains. I would expect it to demonstrate to the commission in its safety case that its inspection and maintenance regimes are appropriate to the condition of its infrastructure and trains.</P>
        <P>In regard to paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s amendment, my amendment No. 95 allows the commission to make regulations restricting the number of standing passengers in trains. In regard to paragraph (<i>d </i>) of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, I would expect a railway undertaking to be able to demonstrate in its safety case that the working patterns of its safety critical staff do not contribute to an increasing risk on the railway. In addition, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last year made regulations SI 817 of 2004 extending the maximum 48 hour working week to transport workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 50, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(h) requirements to avoid accidental obstruction of railway infrastructure by road vehicles by establishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) criteria for the apportionment of responsibility and cost of improvements to be made at locations where roads meet, cross or run close to railways,</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that necessary on Committee Stage? I want to make a case for this amendment, which refers to situations where there is an interface between the railway and roads infrastructure. It aims to regulate the situation in some way where, for instance, there may be a dispute or even unwillingness by either party to accept responsibility for safety improvements that may need to be made. The amendment seeks some system to dictate how boundary treatments are organised, as well as reporting, collating and recording accidents. This area is completely unregulated. I do not know if the Minister is aware that in Dublin trucks are constantly damaging railway bridges when they come into contact with them. This issue is likely to become even more prevalent if super-cubes are to be allowed on to our city streets. The regulation of this area needs to be tightened up.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards paragraph (i) of Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s amendment No. 97, section 23 of the Transport (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1971 makes a provision concerning the apportionment of the costs of upgrading works at a level crossing between the railway undertaking and the local authority. Section 92 of the Bill before the House, as passed in committee, makes provision concerning the responsibility of any person carrying out works on a public road near a railway.</P>
        <P>As regards paragraph (ii) of Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s amendment No. 97, section 92(4), as passed in committee, already provides the commission with power to prepare and publish guidelines on works on public roads that may affect the safety of a railway infrastructure. The interim commission is currently preparing these guidelines to be ready for adoption by the commission on its establishment. I hope that is helpful to the Deputy.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(5) In considering an appeal against an improvement notice, the Court shall take into account the general duties of railway undertakings and others under <i>sections 36 </i>and <i>37</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">On Committee Stage there was considerable discussion of Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s amendments Nos. 63 and 65, which proposed that commercial considerations would not be grounds for an appeal against an improvement or prohibition notice. Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised a related amendment today. While I have much sympathy with Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s proposal on Committee Stage, it would be inappropriate to impose restrictions on what a person could plead before the courts. However, I have examined the Bill to see if there is some workable and practical means of giving the appropriate weighting to commercial and safety considerations in the Bill, given the imperative requirements attaching to safety. I propose to address Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s concerns through my amendments Nos. 107 and 109. These <Col N="369"/>amendments will require a judge or jury, in considering an appeal against an improvement or prohibition notice, to take into account the safety imperative implied in the duties imposed in sections 36 and 37 of the Bill, as passed in committee. Section 36 places a duty on a railway undertaking to ensure the safety of persons in the operation of its railway in so far as is reasonably practicable. Section 37 places a duty on others to ensure that a person is not exposed to danger on a railway by their actions or omissions, again in so far as is reasonably practicable.</P>
        <P>Deputy Olivia Mitchell&rsquo;s amendment No. 118 proposes that a railway undertaking may not consider cost when complying with its duty under section 36. Ultimately, under the provisions of this section it will be a matter for a judge or jury to decide what it is reasonable for a railway undertaking to do in a particular circumstance to ensure safety. Nobody can give an absolute guarantee of safety in anything we do. As a society we decide that there is a reasonable risk on a daily basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the situation. I have given the matter considerable thought and as the general duties of the railway undertaking transcend commercial considerations, the matter would be decided by a court. As the Minister says this is the only reasonable expectation we could have and I will not press my amendment.</P>

        <P LI="1">83.&mdash;This Part comes into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a fundamental and important issue. I would like to make a number of introductory remarks regarding the new Parts 9 and 10 which are before the House. My predecessor announced on Committee Stage the intention to introduce criminal sanctions for workers found to be intoxicated while working on the railway. The then Minister had earlier signalled on Second Stage his intention to look at this area by inviting Deputies to submit their views on the issue. Since the announcement on Committee Stage, the advice of the Attorney General and of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been obtained. Consultations have also taken place with railway unions, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the Luas operator, Connex.</P><Col N="371"/>
        <P>It is a general societal view that drug and alcohol use is a significant problem and it is clear that any use of intoxicants by safety critical workers represents potential for significant operational risk. My Department has sought information on the position in other jurisdictions and while no uniform approach to managing the use of drugs and alcohol by safety critical workers on railways exists, many European countries, including the UK, have made it a criminal offence to be intoxicated while working on the railway. In a number of countries the railway undertakings themselves, recognising the inherent dangers of intoxicant abuse, have introduced, as part of their internal procedures, provisions which provide for testing for drugs and alcohol. Nearer to home, Connex, the operator of the Luas system, has provision for random testing and subsequent disciplinary actions built in to workers&rsquo; contracts.</P>
        <P>Other examples are as follows. In the United States, legislation has been in place since 1991 that provides for drug and alcohol testing on a random basis covering all transportation workers. The US annual drug and alcohol testing rates for 2004 in respect of the Federal Railroad Administration was 25% for drugs and 10% for alcohol.</P>
        <P>In Sweden, random testing is carried out by an independent body on behalf of the railway undertakings. Each station is tested on average four times a year.</P>
        <P>In Northern Ireland, a voluntary code of conduct exists in Northern Ireland Rail which provides for random testing of drugs and alcohol. An offence can result in dismissal as can a refusal to take the test. In France, internal company procedures provide for testing for drugs and dismissal is an option for the company if a safety critical worker is found to be intoxicated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In New South Wales, the 2002 Rail Safety Act requires rail operators to implement a drug and alcohol programme. The independent transport safety and reliability regulator can conduct random drug and alcohol testing of rail safety workers at any work site. I hope it will be clear that I have given careful thought and consideration to this matter before presenting the proposals before the House for amendment of the Bill regarding intoxicants.</P>
        <P>I want to signal at this point that the new provisions, particularly as regards sampling for drugs in Part 9, are based on a partnership approach. The Bill requires that the sampling procedures, code of conduct and support services must be drawn up in consultation with unions and staff representatives and must be approved by the new independent railway safety commission provided for in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I propose to delete the present Part 9 of the Bill which provides for matters relating to internal company sampling and disciplinary procedures for intoxicants and to substitute a new <Col N="372"/>Part 9 which provides for similar matters. I also propose a new Part 10 which provides for matters relating to criminal offences for intoxication while working on a railway. The new Part 10 also provides for certain other matters withdrawn on Committee Stage, namely, offences for careless and dangerous working on a railway and requirements regarding medical fitness for safety critical work on a railway.</P>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that my colleague, Deputy Naughten, raised many concerns when these amendments were introduced on Committee Stage. However, as I am satisfied that the Minister has now taken on board those concerns, I am very happy to support him. These changes are necessary and I believe the required safeguards now exist.</P>
        <P>Several different terms are used in respect of the person carrying out sampling. For example the terms &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; and &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo; are used. In other cases &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; is mentioned. Is it absolutely clear that an authorised person is a medical practitioner? The section states that an authorised person involved in sampling should receive training as determined by the undertaking.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last day we discussed how the Minister proposed dealing with the legislation. As we know the Bill was published in 2001. Last year when we eventually got around to taking Committee Stage, we had the most inept handling of legislation I have ever witnessed. After Deputy Naughten and I, along with others, had put considerable time into the Committee Stage discussion, one morning the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor arrived with a new Part 9 and Part 10 which we had never seen before. In spite of our best efforts to block it, he pressed ahead. It then took the intervention of David Begg at the most senior level in Government to stop it, which is how the legislation was stalled for the past year. It is important to remind ourselves about the mis<Col N="373"/>handling of that matter by the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, which led to the delay of a minimum of 12 months and was no way to do business. I recognise that discussions have taken place in the interim.</P>
        <P>It is important to remember there is no history of intoxicant use or abuse within the railways. In none of the accidents was the cause found to be related to intoxicants of any kind. We must recognise that and give due credit to those working on our railways through the years who have maintained a high work standard. From the way the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, spoke on the matter, one would imagine it was a huge problem, but there is no intoxicant history there with regard to accidents. We should thank people for their commitment in that regard.</P>
        <P>Many of the concerns we had when this Bill was sprung on us last year by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, arose because it contained no clear definitions. It was very loose in terms of who would have access to the samples that could be taken and in terms of the definitions. I welcome the fact that this has been tightened up to some extent, and that those areas which have not been tightened are subject to discussions on protocols, code of conduct and so on.</P>
        <P>It is difficult for anyone to object to the notion of public transport workers being subject to random testing because, clearly, a major safety issue is involved. However, it is a little rich to hear the Minister talk today of other countries where there is random breath testing among many different groups of transport workers. The Minister and his predecessor have consistently opposed any attempt or calls to introduce random breath testing for road users. Notwithstanding what he said about Connex, no other group of workers in the transport area is subject to random testing.</P>
        <P>Any night of the week, one can see very busy car parks at any pub. People are in the pubs for lengthy periods of time and it is quite clear to all of us that considerable numbers of people are driving cars after imbibing intoxicants. There seems to be no political will to tackle the issue. We see road carnage on a regular basis, very often as a result of drink driving.</P>
        <P>Some months ago the Minister had an opportunity to redress this by means of the Road Traffic Bill, when I proposed an amendment to provide for the introduction of random breath testing for drivers. He voted against it. On a number of occasions he has said he has faced difficulties, is awaiting legal advice and is getting various messages from the Attorney General, yet nothing has been produced.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor promised that random testing was on the way. It was part of the road safety strategy and is a clear target in the current road safety strategy for introduction by 2006. The Government spokesperson, Deputy <Col N="374"/>Power, appeared on television last week, however, and clearly knew nothing about the matter nor had any plans to do anything about it. Similarly the T&aacute;naiste, when asked about the matter during the Order of Business last week, knew nothing about it.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to target one particular group of workers. If random testing is to be introduced, it should be introduced across the board. The Minister frequently notes constitutional and other legal problems with regard to introducing random testing for drivers yet he has no difficulty in introducing it for railway workers. Every excuse in the book is produced to explain why the Minister has not introduced random testing on the roads. Let us apply the testing evenly to all, across the board.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister will indicate his intentions. It is one thing to set down targets in a safety strategy but quite another to do something about them and ensure that the area is given priority, So far, there is no indication from the Department that the Minister is personally taking up the issue or making any attempt to champion it. Given his responsibility for road safety, this is an area where priority should be given. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s view and ask him to make a clear statement as to his intentions, and the timescale involved.</P>
        <P>There are serious issues involved in Part 10 of the Bill with regard to criminalising what we would call carelessness. I have some concerns about definitions. The section has certainly been improved in so far as the offences apply to everyone working in a railway undertaking whereas previously, management was not deemed to have any role or responsibility in the area. However, I am concerned about the definition of carelessness. The penalties are very severe and I wonder if we are clear on whether there is potential for management, perhaps, or someone who has it in for a particular worker or group of workers to scapegoat someone on the basis of something as simple as failure to tie one&rsquo;s shoe-lace adequately. Could that be deemed to be carelessness, and thus liable to be a criminal offence? There is some danger that people could be singled out, perhaps people who for one reason or another were not popular with management because of activities in which they were involved. Under the proposals before us it would be easy enough to frame someone. I would like to know what safeguards the Minister will put in place to ensure this does not happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support many of the points made by Deputy Shortall, particularly with regard to random testing, my main area of concern. The Bill refers to giving a person the power to oblige employees to provide samples and refers to &ldquo;reasonable grounds for suspicion&rdquo;. From outside, it seems reasonable to discuss such matters, but as <Col N="375"/>we know the difficulty is that there has been a poisoned relationship in the railway sector between management and many of the workers. There has been a public perception and a worry that this element of the Bill would be used by a less than perfect management as a tool of harassment or bullying. This concern has been expressed to me.</P>
        <P>Random drug and alcohol tests are a violation of civil rights. The Minister mentioned the workers in Connex but the only other workers whom I know of who are subject to such tests are those in the Defence Forces. I am uncomfortable with this. I was also uncomfortable with the fact that the last Minister for Transport was pushing the notion of this random testing. As other speakers noted, there is no evidence to suggest that in the past 30 years, drugs or alcohol have been involved in any railway accident. That is not to say there might be such involvement in the future but it seems odd that this legislation supposedly had to be rushed through. The issue of random testing seemed to jump out at one. I did not get an answer from the Minister as to his reasons for its proposed introduction.</P>
        <P>I object to random testing because of the thought process behind it. Such testing is invasive, and doubt hangs over its effectiveness. Driver fatigue is a bigger issue but it did not arise in any of the discussions. It certainly was not raised by the Minister. However, people who work in this area regularly talk about the long hours involved.</P>
        <P>Random drug testing removes the assumption of innocence because the person subjected to the test must prove he is innocent by providing a clear sample. Where random drug testing is carried out, the person giving the sample is forced to strip and urinate into a cup in the presence of an observer to prevent cheating. I welcome the fact that the Minister has in mind a partnership approach with the unions and I hope that is not the type of random testing that will be undertaken. It would create major difficulties and human resources problems.</P>
        <P>Random drug testing can also disclose information of a personal medical nature. It can inform an employer if an employee is on medication for a heart condition, epilepsy or other illnesses. It can also reveal if a female employee is pregnant, even if she is unaware of it and might not want to be aware of it. These are genuine and legitimate privacy concerns and the legislation has not taken sufficient account of them.</P>
        <P>The test, if it produces a positive result, provides no evidence of present intoxication or impairment. It merely indicates that a person may have taken a drug at some time in the past. This issue arose in the United States. The American Civil Liberties Union has carried out a great deal of research on this issue in the face of attempts to spread random drug testing into the workplace <Col N="376"/>and schools. Commonly used drug tests have yielded false positive results of between 10% and 30%, according to the ACLU.</P>
        <P>I do not believe there is a problem with drug and alcohol abuse in the rail industry. There is probably a bigger problem with driver fatigue and people being forced to work long hours. Perhaps the Minister will explain the partnership approach further. It appears that this section has delayed the Bill. I welcome the fact that there are ongoing discussions with the unions on this matter because people have a genuine concern that we are moving into new territory. I do not know where this move originated. I await the Minister&rsquo;s comments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the responses of the Deputies. Lest Members consider this to be specific to railway safety critical workers, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 contained the same provisions that are being introduced today. This is happening across the system in all types of work. In general, Deputies appear to believe we have taken the concerns on board, notwithstanding whatever issues arose as Deputy Shortall outlined previously. Knowing my colleague, I do not believe there was any malice aforethought. Perhaps it was just an effort to try and include it.</P>
        <P>That debate threw up key issues and, as Deputies said, we have reflected on them. It is a partnership approach. I appreciate the concerns workers have about their rights, and they are right to have them. We have had much discussion in working out the protocols surrounding this and I believe we have reached a point of general satisfaction on the issue.</P>
        <P>I wish to answer the question Deputies Shortall and Mitchell raised about random breath testing. The difference between rail and road random testing can be outlined as follows. I have received advice on how the weighting is done with regard to individuals on roads. Irish Rail, a service provided or funded by the State, employs approximately 5,500 staff, of whom approximately 3,800 work on safety critical tasks. These employees are responsible for the safe movement of over 35 million passengers each year. On the roads, driving is an individual responsibility for each person. The issue of proportionality arises with the introduction of random testing.</P>
        <P>The Attorney General has advised that in the case of random testing for safety critical staff on the railways, the proposed random testing provision would withstand constitutional scrutiny on the basis that the balance struck between the private rights of individuals and those of the greater public is proportionate. This is a fundamental issue we must deal with on the introduction of random breath testing in the sense mentioned by Deputy Shortall. Deputy Olivia Mitchell has also raised this in the past.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P>Under the Road Traffic Acts, garda&iacute; are empowered to check all drivers involved in road collisions or detected committing any traffic offence, in addition to having the power to demand a test of a driver who, in the opinion of a garda, has consumed alcohol. We are way ahead of other countries in that.</P>
        <P>I accept Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s point in that I would rather get this item off the agenda, one way or another. I cannot sustain a position of giving the impression that I do not want to do anything about this. However, as both Deputies are aware, given that their parties have been in Government, one cannot come to the House with a provision, regardless of the issue, unless one has legal advice that it will stand. Road traffic legislation is probably the most often challenged legislation in the courts and there is no question that if we introduce random breath testing it will be challenged. I am not worried about that but I cannot knowingly introduce a measure that has almost no chance of success in the courts. That is the position.</P>
        <P>There have been a number of proposals aimed at overcoming the proportionality issue and ideas are being examined. Some of them make sense in certain ways but in others they do not. I would like to reach a conclusion on this issue. For the present, I have a formula backed up by legal certainty that this has a good chance of success. Even though we know this legislation will probably be challenged it is worth legislating for on the basis that we believe it is robust enough to withstand a legal challenge in the courts. At present, the introduction of random breath testing in an untargeted way would, I am told, be unlikely to withstand a court challenge.</P>
        <P>That is the position. There is no reticence on my part. I am not a legal practitioner and I am not trying to shift the blame but to resolve the issue. I want to be able to tell the House whether something cannot be done or what is the best that is achievable according to the legal advice. We are trying to narrow it to a couple of issues and I thank the officials and the legal personnel in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for their assistance with this. Members can see where it breaks down, and this is a good example. Given the responsibility in this area and the proportionality involved, it is likely that the balance is struck in doing it and this would have a good chance of withstanding a court challenge. At the moment, the advice is that simply random breath testing everybody who has an individual responsibility would be most unlikely to withstand a court challenge. On that basis, I cannot put it before the House with any confidence. That is the bind in which I find myself.</P>
        <P>I am being open with the Deputies. I am reaching the point where I would like to say either that as far as I am concerned, it is off my watch because I cannot resolve this issue or that I have <Col N="378"/>a proposal to achieve it. If we find a proposal we believe to be workable, I will be happy to seek the Deputies&rsquo; thoughts on it even before proceeding with it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It has fallen apart in some countries. It was tried but failed. I will forward that information to the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems extraordinary that it cannot be introduced unless on a targeted basis.</P>
        <P>If that is the core of legal advice and the basis for the Minister&rsquo;s approach, then the next category of people would be bus and coach drivers, taxi drivers and so on. When, if ever, would it be applied to individual drivers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>To avoid any misunderstanding, I was referring specifically to road users in general. There must be some form of proportionality applied. Some options have been suggested but I do not know if they are a good or a bad idea and I wonder how some of them would provide a solution. I do not wish to give the Deputy the impression that when I spoke about proportionality I was doing so in the comfort zone of picking out groups; I was talking specifically in reference to a solution about a general group.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister referring to proportionality in respect of the level of risk and the numbers of people involved? He referred to the numbers of people being driven by train drivers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>No. I was referring to the train drivers as an example of a good, solid reason. They are responsible for transporting 35 million people and the proportionality stands up in this case. With regard to individuals, such as car drivers, I am informed it is probably impossible to introduce random breath testing, with which we would all be in favour. From recollection, constitutionally it has not been possible in other countries and it has failed in countries where it has been attempted. It is a question of how to approach the issue. Do other issues arise within that grouping which can be tackled? I do not wish to say more because it is then regarded as something that will be done and that is not the way to hold a debate.</P><Col N="379"/>
        <P>I will be happy to consider other options and to discuss the legal advice I have received and try to move the issue forward. There is not a way of legislating for it to be done on an open-ended basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a very pressing national issue and it is one of the two main contributing factors to road fatalities. There is cross-party agreement that this problem needs to be tackled and many people are making a sincere effort to grapple with it. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport will be dealing with this issue next week and a number of people have been invited to speak on the subject. The Minister has also agreed to meet the committee in a few weeks&rsquo; time.</P>
        <P>The Minister has referred to and quoted his legal advice from time to time. Is he prepared to make this legal advice available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport because it seems to be the main stumbling block? The political will exists, as does the social acceptance of the need to do something about drink driving and, by and large, the media would be supportive of such action. The main stumbling block is the legality of the action or the legal pitfalls involved. If these have been examined and outlined to the Minister by the Office of the Attorney General, I ask that as a contribution to the debate, he would make that legal advice available to the committee for its meeting tomorrow week because it would be helpful to the national debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Deputy can see that I am engaged with this issue and on which I have had many discussions. It would be worth discussing the legal advice with the committee but I will refer to the Office of the Attorney General on that matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>One does not need a <i>fait accompli</i> in everything. We seldom have an open debate about things. It is accepted that this is a national issue which needs to be tackled. I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s declaration of his good intentions in this regard and that it is a serious issue. It seems he has been provided with extensive legal advice. As a contribution to this debate and in an effort to move the debate forward, will the Minister publish that advice and let the House know about the problems? I suggest we all take legal advice on this matter and present our proposals for the Minister&rsquo;s consideration. Why is it necessary to wait until everything is finalised and the Minister has presented his final proposal? There is a sense of urgency about this issue and much interest in it. He should put his legal advice in the public domain and we can take it from there. The Minister should accept that neither he nor the <Col N="380"/>Office of the Attorney General has the monopoly of wisdom in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the point made by the Deputy. There is no question that any legislation will be challenged in the courts. The first person caught under the random breath testing will go to the courts immediately as is their right. I do not wish to introduce a measure which has no chance of success and will result in an undermining of the road safety strategy and possibly other things.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should allow us read the legal advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Much of the advice is delivered orally in discussions of whether a method would be possible or be a success. The advice is given orally rather than the production of tomes of responses. I have put the principles involved clearly to the House in this debate this afternoon and I have done so in the past and provided examples. I will consider the point made by the Deputy but I will not go any further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a difference in law between random breath testing to detect whether or not a person has been drinking and random speed testing with a roadside speed gun?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a good point but I am not a lawyer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I merely wonder whether there is an answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the answer to that question. Given that there is random speed testing but not random breath testing, I suspect there are fundamental differences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Even the speed testing is constantly being challenged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy but it is so far, so good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for returning to this issue but it has been kicked to touch for many years and after all the talk we should endeavour to bring it to some kind of fruition. The House does not know the legal principles and difficulties relating to this issue. Apart from discussing the issue of proportionality, we do not know about other difficulties which may exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the core issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister allow the House read the legal advice? There is a general perception among the public that a close association exists between Members of this House and the publicans&rsquo; lobby and this point is often made <Col N="381"/>regarding members of the Minister&rsquo;s party. A number of Members of this House are publicans. The longer it takes for any action at Government level, the more cynical the public become and the more they believe there is a vested interest and the political will to do anything about it is absent.</P>
        <P>The Minister seems to be kicking to touch again today. I have asked him a straight question. The joint committee will consider this issue next week. I ask the Minister to provide the House with the legal advice in order to help the debate. If the Minister kicks to touch it is difficult to blame people for being sceptical about whether the Government has the political will to tackle this serious social problem. I implore the Minister to give favourable consideration to my request and to produce the legal advice in time for the committee meeting tomorrow week.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendments is to update the law on fare evasion. The existing law on fare evasion is set out in sections 5 and 6 of the Regulations of Railway Acts 1889, as amended by section 10 of the Transport Act 1987, which I am proposing to repeal in amendments Nos. 155 and 157 and replace with the new section set out in amendment No. 151. The principles in the 1889 Act are still appropriate.</P>
        <P>This amendment is essentially to modernise the legislation. Amendment No. 151 requires a person when requested by an employee of a railway company to produce a valid ticket for the journey made. If the person does not have a valid ticket, an employee of the railway company can require him or her to pay the correct fare or the standard fare for fare evasion levied by the railway company, or to give his or her name and address. A person who refuses this request will be guilty of an offence. It will also be an offence to wilfully evade the correct fare or to give a false name and address when requested. Conviction will carry a maximum fine of &euro;1,000 and the offender will still be liable for the unpaid fare or standard fare levied. The prison sentence provided for in the 1889 Act is in excess of penalty and, therefore, I do not propose to include this.</P>

On-the-spot fines are established practice in many jurisdictions and they have the advantage of not clogging up the courts with minor prosecutions.

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 153 and 154 update the Transport Railway Infrastructure Act 2001. All the provisions proposed in amendment No. 153 are standard provisions relating to by-laws for railway operation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 153 replaces section 66 of the 2001 Act with four new sections. The first of these four sections replaces the present by-law provisions set out in section 66 of the 2001 Act. The new by-law provisions condense some new measures not included in the present text of the 2001 Act. These are that by-laws must be published. By-laws must be displayed conspicuously on the railway. By-laws cannot be made without the consent of the Minister and by-laws must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The RPA or railway undertaking may recoup the cost of any damage to the railway caused by the breach of a by-law, in addition to any fine imposed for the breach.</P>
        <P>The second of these four new sections entitled &ldquo;immobilisation, removal, etc. of unlawfully parked vehicles&rdquo; relates to clamping and removing of vehicles.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 153:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the new section 66A of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, in subsection (1), to delete subparagraph (i).</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendments proposes to delete subparagraph (i). It appears that it is illogical to give the power to clamp a car if it is parked on the railway line. It would appear obvious to move it and then clamp it. I do not see the point in giving power to clamp it <i>in situ</i> if it is parked on a railway line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it about parking?</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about removing powers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It depends which way one looks at it. The first part of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would have the effect of denying an authorised Luas staff member the power to clamp a vehicle which is in breach of by-laws or is otherwise causing a danger or nuisance. I note the Deputy is agreeable to such vehicle being towed away and clamped in another location as this is provided for in the subsequent paragraph. I do not see any reason to deny Luas personnel the flexibility to clamp the vehicle where it is parked rather than tow it and clamp it elsewhere. The second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s proposal would reduce the cost of on-the-spot fines for specified offences from &euro;100 to &euro;60. They should not be reduced to less than &euro;60. A vehicle could block the Luas line, which the driver would want to move, and that could be clamped while a vehicle parked near a Luas line could be clamped but not necessarily moved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to proportionality earlier. The fine for not paying a &euro;20 fare on a train is &euro;100 but if one fails to pay a &euro;2 fare on Luas, the fine is still &euro;100, which is excessive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Deputy because we have moved to multiple new systems. Recently a person boasted about the number of times he had travelled on one of the systems without paying a fare. That is wrong even though the same numbers of inspectors as in the past are not available to provide a visible presence. People are on their honour. If they abuse the system, they must be hurt in some way. A fine of &euro;100 will not break anybody but it will send a message. People would not avoid paying a few euro for a fare if they thought the fine for failing to pay was &euro;100.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Departmental officials kindly provided a briefing last week for Deputy Olivia Mitchell and myself, during which we discussed the schedule for taking the legislation. The understanding was that the Bill would not be before the House until next week. I did not receive a schedule of business for this week and it was only when one of the officials rang me before lunch that I discovered the Bill would be before the House today. I want to table Report Stage amendments, including an amendment that was not discussed on Committee Stage. I gave notice of my intention to table an amendment in that regard.</P>
        <P>This is not a satisfactory way of dealing with legislation. Given that the Department sat on it for four years and that the Minister has sat on it for 12 months following a lengthy Committee Stage debate, it is unreasonable to spring Fifth Stage now and rush us into finalising the legislation. Another few days will not make a difference to the legislation.</P><Col N="428"/>
        <P>In deference to Members of the House and proper procedure, I ask the Minister to defer Report Stage to enable us to table amendments, as we are entitled to do under Standing Orders. It would be most unfair if the Minister pushed ahead and forced Report Stage through without giving us notice and, thereby, denying us an opportunity to engage in a debate on Fifth Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Where a Bill has been recommitted, it is not the practice to have a separate Report Stage in respect of the amendments. Recommital is not a separate Stage of a Bill and it can only be invoked when a Bill is on Report Stage. If there is a disagreement on this point and if there is a view that a separate Report Stage should be provided for the proceedings, Report Stage would need to be adjourned to enable time to be given for the tabling of amendments. These circumstances pertain and, therefore, I will put the question.</P>

        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the action of Irish Ferries in proposing to sack 543 workers who are on trade union rates of pay and established working conditions to be replaced by vulnerable migrant workers on appalling wages and conditions;</P>

      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the greed driving this strategy as evidenced by the huge salaries paid to Irish Ferries senior executives while the east European workers proposed to be employed would be on about <Col N="430"/>&euro;3.50 an hour, less than half the current legal minimum wage in the State;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the support which the employers body, IBEC, publicly gave to this strategy of Irish Ferries, thus making a mockery of its claim to be in partnership with workers and their trade unions;</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the hypocrisy of the Government pretending to be critical of the Irish Ferries proposal yet having paid a grant of millions of euro to that company to make 150 workers redundant on the <i>MV Normandy</i> to be replaced by exploited labour; and</P>
      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the growing tendency in areas such as construction, the meat industry, hotels and catering to exploit migrant labour at the expense of permanent jobs on trade union rates of pay and decent working conditions;</P>

      <P el="5">
        <?oasys _dc20-?><?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>the right of, and strongly encourages, all migrant workers to join trade unions and unite with Irish-born workers in achieving decent pay, safe and proper working conditions and freedom from victimisation and urges the trade union movement to launch an intensive campaign to facilitate this; and</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p4-?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p6-?><?oasys _ix?>calls for an appropriate increase in the number of labour inspectors who should be well resourced to assist workers suffering exploitation and to prosecute their exploiters.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I wish to share my time with Deputies Harkin, Connolly, Catherine Murphy, Cowley, Eamon Ryan and Crowe.</P>
      <P>First, I absolutely reject the Government amendment where it states that there is no question of employment rights being in free-fall in this State. It should tell that to the Gama workers for whom the so-called robust State institutions failed dismally to expose that scandal. It must be remembered that it was the same Labour Court that recommended the <i>MV Normandy</i> deal and set a precedent for this new Irish Ferries scandal.</P>
      <P>Second, the Government makes reference to the social partnership continuing to contribute but contribute to what? The social partnership will be dead if the employer group, IBEC, continues to support the Irish Ferries executives&rsquo; strategy of replacing trade union rates of pay with half the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The Irish Ferries workers were given no real option. They either had to give up their jobs or face exploitation. If Irish Ferries is allowed to get away with this assault on the very concept of a job with decent wages and conditions simply to maximise profits, while its executives cream off obscene levels of income, it will give the green light to every greed-driven employer to replace reasonably paid workers with vulnerable and exploited labour.</P>
      <P>Most people believed this form of exploitation was in the past. If the Irish Ferries strategy is allowed to happen any Government that stands over it will be seen as acting in the interests of the exploiter rather than as a defender of the rights of the citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this extremely important and timely motion tabled by the Independent Deputies. While the essence of this motion concerns Irish Ferries and the appalling vista facing its workers, it also concerns the kind of Ireland in which we wish to live, and the rights of Irish and migrant workers to earn a decent wage.</P>
      <P>Some people seem content to shrug their shoulders saying &ldquo;it is too bad for the workers on Irish <Col N="432"/>Ferries but at least it will not happen to me&rdquo;. How many of these people are aware of possible upcoming legislation, namely the services directive, emanating from the European Parliament? While there are positive aspects to this legislation, one of the key issues is the country of origin principle. If a service provider from country A provides services in another country, for example, Ireland, that service provider will be subject only to consumer and employment legislation in its own country yet will provide services in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I and many members of the Parliament absolutely oppose this section of the directive. The Commission, however, and our Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, propose that we operate in this way. Problems arose in the past with the textile industry in Donegal, today in Irish Ferries, and tomorrow or the next day might affect service jobs. While the conditions and context of these instances are not identical, the outcomes are similar.</P>
      <P>The EU is not entirely to blame. It has been responsible for much progressive social legislation and hopefully this will be true also of the services directive. In 1999 the European Parliament approved a ferries directive which protected workers on ferries operating between member states, such that they would be subject to the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the residents of one of the member states between whose ports the service is provided. This was good legislation. No agreement could be reached, however, within the Council of Ministers or the Commission and in 2004 the Commission withdrew the directive.</P>
      <P>This directive is to be reactivated but will it be too late for the Irish Ferries workers? Perhaps this explains the moves by Irish Ferries to do the deed before EU legislation might prevent it from doing so.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment to this motion is a joke. It recalls Pontius Pilate washing his hands. It &ldquo;calls on Irish Ferries to reconsider its proposal to outsource employment on its Irish Sea routes and to examine alternative viability options for these routes&rdquo;. The Government and the Minister of State know, as we all do, that Irish Ferries is going through the motions. It has no intention of negotiating. It has been recruiting people for the past two months and its share price has risen in recent weeks. The market has spoken but the Government is silent, paralysed by inaction and washing its hands like Pontius Pilate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Scottish Parliament did not abandon its workers. It brought in a range of requirements for the take-over of Northlink Ferries ensuring new owners would comply with current rates, terms and work conditions. Irish Ferries is leading the headlong race of greed to the bottom. It will be urged on by commentators whose vision of Ireland is to maximise profit for the few, dis<Col N="433"/>regarding the right of Irish and EU citizens to a sustainable economic and socially balanced future. It is time for Bertie the socialist to stand up and be counted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>The dispute at Irish Ferries has the potential to blow the 18 year old social partnership process sky high. This is the partnership that brought us the Celtic tiger. Irish Ferries management seems determined to embark on a course of naked and gross exploitation of vulnerable, mainly eastern European employees. The company&rsquo;s plan to make 540 of its workers redundant and replace them with cheap east European labour is an insult to Irish taxpayers who must foot the bill for the redundancy payments.</P>
      <P>The company has also threatened to withdraw its so-called offer if staff do not accept its terms. This has the whiff of industrial blackmail and bullying which hitherto has been foreign &mdash; no pun intended &mdash; to all previous norms of industrial relations policy. The Taoiseach described the move as unacceptable, deplorable and against the spirit of social partnership. He also declared several times recently that he does not wish to see a race to the bottom in employment standards. I do not know who coined that phrase but it is apt.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder the Taoiseach has referred the issue of the Government subsidising the redundancy package to the Attorney General for his advice. The proposal has also been variously described as an affront to Irish taxpayers, corporate greed and naked pursuit of profit maximisation by an unscrupulous company. Its implications for the future of social partnership are stark. Social partnership has, on balance, been good for the country with the greatest fruits accruing to business. Is this why IBEC cries wolf about Irish Ferries&rsquo; cost base that it claims is excessive relative to its competitors? At least those competitors normally hire crews in the countries from which they sail and manage to maintain relatively low cost bases.</P>
      <P>The slave rate of &euro;3.60 per hour proposed for east European workers is not only well below the average industrial wage but it is little more than half the Irish minimum wage. If Irish Ferries can flout accepted industrial relations practices with impunity, and victimise our counterparts in eastern Europe the future for social partnership looks grim. There is no guarantee that talks on a new national wage agreement to succeed Sustaining Progress will even get off the ground. Its future is in the balance.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Irish Ferries already has egg on its corporate face following its unconscionable treatment of a Filipino worker, whom it paid &euro;1 per hour. That was the bottom level of wage payments. This worker achieved a payout of &euro;35,000 after a very difficult fight. Irish Ferries was exposed as utterly lacking in any personal value system in its blind pursuit of corporate profits.</P><Col N="434"/>
      <P>If the ferry company gets away with this unscrupulous behaviour there is little doubt that other employers will follow suit. Such behaviour, condoned by IBEC, is already widespread in construction, security, catering, contract cleaning and in areas of manufacturing. Not all employers in these sectors descend to the bottom but the culture appears to be gaining ground.</P>
      <P>There is no link between a ship&rsquo;s owners and its country of registration under a flag of convenience. Companies register their ships under these flags to maximise profit and minimise cost, to avoid economic regulations and standards applying in their own countries. The crew&rsquo;s papers are frequently confiscated as soon as they embark, effectively reducing them to slave status. Fewer than 40 countries have ratified the Conference on Trade and Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>Early this year the <i>MV Normandy</i> with a shamrock and the name Irish Ferries on its side, sat outside a French port where it was not allowed to dock because it was using the equivalent of slave labour. This made the headlines in several EU countries. What kind of message is that to send out about this so-called great economy, built on partnership between workers and employers? This company, when publicly owned, was a standard-bearer, a genuine flagship, and that was in the bad old days. The spectacle of French dockers refusing to allow the Irish ship <i>MV Normandy</i> to dock sends a warning signal and unless we do something about it, we will have to get used to our passengers being stranded and goods produced here not reaching their destinations. We must deal with the fundamental issue of flags of convenience and their consequences.</P>
      <P>The 543 workers, most of whom expressed an interest in accepting redundancy &mdash; a word that should be in inverted commas &mdash; would have been mad to do anything else. They were faced with the prospect of working at half the minimum wage under almost slave-like conditions. The ship is unlikely to be monitored and long-established practices such as international maritime conventions are to be set aside. Any right-thinking person would have to ask himself whether he would work for that kind of money, with poorer conditions, when he is putting his life at risk. Of course they opted for redundancy, but let us call a spade a spade; it is not redundancy but social dumping. I have always understood the term &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; to mean that the job was made redundant and not the worker.</P>
      <P>I honestly do not understand why that is not the main issue being addressed by the Government. It is not redundancy. We are told that it is being done because of low air fares, but the bulk of Irish Ferries&rsquo; income is from freight.</P>
      <P>As an island nation, we cannot exist with the practice of flags of convenience. Having con<Col N="435"/>sidered their background, I am very concerned at some aspects that are not really being highlighted. Standards in countries such as the Bahamas, where this set of vessels is registered, are not those that we require, an example being the requirement for ships to have a double hull. Spain paid the price in 2002 when its beaches were destroyed. Some 58% of all vessels lost at sea in 2001 flew flags of convenience, yet only 23% of the total were registered as such. That indicates that there is a safety issue as well as an economic one to consider in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to speak on this very important motion, which reflects a total and utter scandal regarding our position as a nation. We no longer value the ordinary people on whose behalf we are contracted to act.</P>
      <P>This is but the tip of the iceberg. What is happening now with Irish Ferries, like the rotten apple in the barrel, will spread and ensure that workers will be deprived of what they regard as their rights. They have fought long and hard through their trade unions to get a minimum wage, and while this manipulation is within the law, it is seen by every decent and reasonable person as the exploitation of workers. It must be stopped. There is an onus on the Government and everyone else to ensure that this rot is not allowed to spread. To do otherwise would be a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>We are all used to the idea of putting profits before people. For instance, in the Corrib gas project, Shell, the arrogant multinational, has been allowed to do so. What is happening now with Irish Ferries is similar. Today, Shell has been in contempt of a ministerial order to break up a 3 km pipeline that it had absolutely no right to build for 71 days. That is a sign of its arrogance. What is happening with Irish Ferries today, with all those workers fobbed off and forced to take redundancy, is happening so that the company can turn another penny profit. It shows its agenda, which is simply to make profits. There must be a response from the Government and everyone else to ensure that people&rsquo;s rights are protected.</P>
      <P>We must ask to what extent our Government is colluding in all this. How much are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of our conservative politics contributing to what is happening at Irish Ferries, and how much will they contribute in future? Regarding the Rossport saga, five brave men were jailed for 94 days for trying to defend their right to be safe at home. What did Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, do for those men? How much did they do to ensure that people&rsquo;s basic property rights were upheld? I would say that they did very little. Their complimenting each other on their statesmanship told the whole story.</P><Col N="436"/>
      <P>Those who constitute the Technical Group, the Independents, have shown the people the way forward regarding how they can address its agenda. The parties of the Technical Group, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Socialist Party, have shown a different point of view regarding how people can stand up for what is essentially right. When decent people are put upon, the people of this country will recognise that and stand up and be counted. They marched in their thousands in support of the Rossport Five and people&rsquo;s right to be safe at home. When the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, came along and decided to abolish the necessity of planning permission for a previously unknown process to bring gas ashore, they recognised that as something very wrong and protested accordingly.</P>
      <P>The people of Ireland will certainly not take this any more. I predict that if Irish Ferries succeeds in going through with this, people will take to the streets in their thousands. They will never again tolerate decent people being put upon by those whose only agenda is profit and who have no wish to treat people decently.</P>
      <P>We must look forward and decide what is important. Each of us in the D&aacute;il has a contract to treat our people properly and carry out our mandate to represent our constituents. The parties and Independents of the Technical Group have proudly done so. With Irish Ferries and the Rossport Five, we have learnt the lesson that the conservative parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, cannot be depended on to stand up for the people, and that is where the Technical Group has shown an alternative way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend my colleagues in the Technical Group, and the Independents in the D&aacute;il, for tabling this important and timely motion, which we in the Green Party wholeheartedly support.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to listen to Deputy Cowley talking about the conservative nature of Irish politics; I agree with him. One of the definitions of conservatism is the sense that things cannot change and that, if the market decides something, we must unfortunately accept it. While the Taoiseach and various Ministers of State have talked up their concerns on this issue, from this side of the House we hear them say that unfortunately there is nothing they can do and nothing can change.</P>
      <P>The first thing that must change is the current culture of this country which allows this sort of development. In many ways, we are powerless against the forces of globalisation and the way in which the international market changes matters. However, we have a collective choice as a people, regarding how exactly that develops and what culture becomes established here. I fear that, in <Col N="437"/>the Irish Ferries dispute, we are looking at a real loss in culture.</P>
      <P>It was interesting, as a member of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to visit the new maritime college in Cork last year and witness the great pride in it. We recognised its great importance to an island nation. To point to our status as an island nation may be a clich&eacute; but it is an important reality. In the future, as our energy scenario unfolds, it will be even more relevant as we become increasingly dependent on sea routes for our future economic and social well-being. In these circumstances, we must recognise that to lack the skill base of a maritime workforce whose members build up experience and knowledge over many years will be a significant loss.</P>
      <P>The Government has presided over a cultural change in the last eight years which is epitomised by certain executives earning remarkable wages while workers at the bottom of the corporate structure earn a tiny fraction of them. This is an unacceptable culture and the situation at Irish Ferries is a continuation of that. It is the worst possible development in the culture of the divided, unequal society this Government has allowed to grow.</P>
      <P>The management of Irish Ferries must answer for the wage levels it is willing to promote. Moreover, it must also answer for its actions. There must be a change in culture and management in Irish business. It seems clear that investment decisions by management rather than the actions of the workforce led the company into the current difficulties with which it claims to struggle. For a company to react to such poor management decisions and investment practice by immediately opting to procure cheaper labour to relieve the problems created by the management is a disgraceful development in the culture of Irish management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the nature of capitalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. However, it is possible for business and enterprise to adhere to a different culture. Such a change is required and the Government must take responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Many Members observed that we could have been a champion in the EU for the ferries directive, which would have precisely dealt with this particular issue. I look forward to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher&rsquo;s, explanation of the role played by the Government and his Department in the Council of Ministers to promote that directive. The Minister of State might also explain what he intends to do further in terms of the EU stage. This is one of the areas where we can do something to address the problem we face in this regard.</P><Col N="438"/>
      <P>It is regrettable that we have seen something of a physical representation of the Government handling of this issue in the team tag that took place when the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, stepped out as the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, stepped in. In trying to raise this issue, Opposition Members have had to go to and fro between the various Departments. A co-ordinated approach is needed. It is regrettable that Deputy Killeen did not remain for the rest of the debate. The two Ministers of State must work together on this issue rather than one stepping out and the other stepping in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The senior Minister should be here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The importance of this issue demands that the senior and junior Ministers from the relevant Departments should be here. Such a response by the Government would be indicative of the change of culture that we seek. It would show that this House takes the matter seriously, that the State is not dominated by corporate interests and that we will occasionally flex our muscles as a democratic republic and take a stand in terms of how we want our country to develop. Such a stance, in both its language and intent, would have an effect in terms of the approach companies decide to take in the long run.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not here for this debate. It is ironic, interesting and perhaps apt that at the same time we are discussing this debate, we are preparing for a debate on legislation dealing with the employment of migrant workers. This is an area in which we can seek amendments that would provide real strength in our right and just attempt not to allow a race to the bottom to develop. I see nothing in the Employment Permits Bill 2005 which addresses the type of issue we face on this occasion although it presents the perfect opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>I am thrilled to see people from so many different countries coming to Ireland. Such developments are of benefit to us all. There is no reason these immigrant workers should not have the same rights as Irish workers in terms of access to the Labour Court, pay and conditions and so on. If such guarantees of parity were in place there would be no race to the bottom. We could simply open up our economy without the dumbing down we have seen. I regret very much that the Government has not taken the opportunity presented by the Employment Permits Bill 2005 to establish a framework and policy background in which corporations can exist. It is also a matter of regret that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has not lived up to the standards this House expects in regard to maritime inspections.</P><Col N="439"/>
      <P>A wide ranging debate must take place on the role of the EU in this area. I do not recall the Government doing much to maintain standards in terms of the ferries directive. Our only contribution to EU developments in recent years has been to send Charlie McCreevy to Brussels. His world view is clear in that he is opposed to any regulation in business and directives in general. He would prefer simply to allow global capital to flourish unhindered. This suits us for now and our economy has no doubt prospered on the back of being a centre of localisation for global capital.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, it is interesting that even IBEC has raised concerns in terms of the loss of manufacturing jobs and the decline of certain industries. People sense a long-term direction change in their increasing realisation that we who have benefited so much from the policy of globalisation may in the long run be particularly vulnerable. Having become dependent on such forces, if the jobs migrate to Poland, Hungary or other cheaper locations, we will be left without the wealth generating sector and nothing but a low-wage economy. In such a scenario, to have allowed a rush to the bottom means we will no longer enjoy the quality of life or the income we expect.</P>
      <P>We must take practical measures to address this matter. If we cannot achieve our objectives immediately or quickly enough on an EU level, we should consider the possibility of bilateral negotiations in agreement with the British and French Governments to set certain key standards. This would prevent a race to the bottom and ensure there is a basic standard of operation in ferry services so that companies cannot choose as their first option the replacement of existing workers with cheaper labour. This is one practical, achievable measure the Government should pursue in the short time we have available rather than sitting back in its conservative way bemoaning that nothing can be done about the market.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I commend this motion. Tomorrow, my colleague Deputy Boyle will further explain the views of the Green Party on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>It is undeniable that Irish Ferries is conducting a human resources strategy which is geared towards replacing its Irish crews with eastern European labour. These workers will be paid well below the minimum wage &mdash; the figure mentioned is a miserly &euro;3.60 per hour. Irish Ferries has outlined to its staff that failure to take the so-called voluntary redundancy package will lead to a drastic reduction in their working conditions with longer hours, wage cuts and shorter holidays. This makes a mockery of the term <?oasys _ch?>&ldquo;voluntary redundancy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a repeat of the travesty we witnessed recently in Aer Lingus, where workers are being forced out of their jobs. It is incumbent on the Minister to take action to ensure Irish workers <Col N="440"/>are not bullied out of their jobs. Events at Aer Lingus and Irish Ferries threaten to unravel the national social partnership process. Executives paid more than &euro;14,000 per week cannot be allowed to bully workers out of their jobs and ride roughshod over workers&rsquo; basic rights in their pursuit of greater profits. The danger now is that these extremely well paid executives will see this type of sharp practice as an acceptable way to grab even more profits for them and their companies.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State not concerned that the social partnership process threatens to unravel? Amazingly, it appears that management has misinterpreted the unions&rsquo; involvement in partnership as a weakness. The contribution of the unions to the Celtic tiger counts for nothing against the avarice and arrogance of these people. Does the Minister of State consider the unions to be weak and will he allow their rights to be undermined? He knows this is not the case.</P>
      <P>If the precedent being set is not reversed it will mean an end to the national social partnership and have severe implications for the rights of Irish workers and industrial relations in general. The gung-ho dismissal by management of SIPTU&rsquo;s independent financial report on the company shows the contempt it holds for the workers in that company.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Government to run away from this issue. Even if the redundancy issue is resolved is it good enough that Irish workers will work seven days per week doing 12 hour shifts on a rate that is well below the minimum wage? The Taoiseach and the Minister deplored this situation but like Pontius Pilate they washed their hands and claimed there is nothing they can do about it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Irish Ferries issue I suggest two solutions. The Government can demand at European Council level an EU ferries directive to deal with the flags of convenience issue. Will we get a commitment from the Minister of State today that this will be done? I have already raised this issue with the Minister and I have been informed negotiations are taking place. The workers in Irish Ferries want answers. If the Minister of State is unable to give a commitment on this issue he could consider introducing a licensing regime for ferries operating on Irish waters. This could be done to ensure that ferries operating in Irish waters adhere to Irish labour law. This has already been done by the Scottish Executive. I ask the Minister to address the issues I have raised and give an undertaking to the House that no company that engages in what the Taoiseach has described as deplorable, unacceptable and sharp practice will be given the Government contract. Given the Government&rsquo;s track record with Gama it is important that this precedent be laid down before companies get the <Col N="441"/>idea that these practices are acceptable to this or any other Government.</P>
      <P>It is worth reflecting on the consequences of privatisation. Irish Ferries was once a State company serving the strategic interests of this island and is now a private company epitomising corporate greed by exploiting migrant labour and threatening to shut down the Dublin-Holyhead and Rosslare-Pembroke routes if workers do not accept the redundancy proposals. Does the Minister accept the workers in Bus &Eacute;ireann have more reason than ever to fear privatisation? This will lead to a rapid erosion of the value of labour with the loss of more jobs at the minimum wage rate. We see here a concerted attack on the value of labour and I ask the Minister of State to say who is at fault. Should the unions be forced to take action to defend the workers and their rights in Irish Ferries?</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Molaim an leas&uacute; thar ceann an Aire Fiontair, Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la agus Fosta&iacute;ochta, an Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin. I wish to share time with my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen.</P>
      <P>I wish to reiterate my serious concern at the current action being taken by Irish Ferries. The company&rsquo;s proposal to make 543 of its seafarers redundant, or have them operate under reduced pay and conditions, is undoubtedly very distressing for all the workers concerned and their families.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that SIPTU, the Seamen&rsquo;s Union of Ireland and the company, are in talks under the auspices of the Labour Court. I would not want anything said in the House this evening to in any way prejudice these discussions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It should not be forgotten that there are two sides to this dispute. From briefings provided to me by the sector&rsquo;s statutory development body, the Irish Maritime Development Office, I am aware of the commercial pressures on all shipping companies to reduce their costs and streamline their operations. It is not for me to seek to determine an independent shipping company&rsquo;s business strategy. My goal is to get Irish ship operators the best possible operating environment to support the company and its employees.</P>
      <P>Maintaining and increasing Irish seafarer employment has been a focus of the Government. We established the Irish Maritime Development Office to provide our shipping and shipping services sector with a dedicated, statutory development office. The IMDO operates like a <Col N="443"/>mini IDA and helps my Department to make a case to Government on the sector&rsquo;s behalf.</P>
      <P>The Government has also set up a new &euro;51 million national maritime college to train our merchant marine and Irish Naval Service cadets. Students pursuing careers at sea can now obtain qualifications or degrees in Europe&rsquo;s most modern nautical college. Together with the National College of Ireland&rsquo;s International Maritime Studies Institute, which opened in 2004, and which is based in the Irish Financial Services Centre in Dublin, the new maritime college will help Ireland to develop as a choice location for shore-based maritime activity. In that regard, the European Commission is taking an increased interest in boosting employment in the Community&rsquo;s maritime sector. The Commission recognises that professional mariners often progress from active sea service to shore-based jobs that require maritime experience.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the Government has introduced a competitive tonnage tax and relief in the income tax and social insurance areas to make it easier for ship operators to employ Irish seafarers, and to increase the take home pay of seafarers working at sea for more than 161 days a year.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies are aware that one of our relief schemes, the employers&rsquo; of seafarers PRSI refund scheme, ended on 31 December 2003. The scheme refunded employers of such seafarers their PRSI contribution for each of its seagoing employees. The reintroduction of the scheme required the agreement of the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance and the co-operation of the Department&rsquo;s mercantile marine office.</P>
      <P>In December 2004 agreement was reached that the scheme should be reintroduced with effect from 1 January 2004, for a period of seven years. Commission approval for the reintroduction of the scheme, under the 2004 Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport, is expected to be received in the next few days. I am confident we will receive that approval given that the European Commission is anxious to ensure a European seafaring sector and advocates such schemes. Accordingly, there will be no break in the scheme&rsquo;s application from the end of December 2003 for a further seven years.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister for Finance to consider the introduction of additional State aids for the sector. I recognise the limitations of such aids in making ferry operations more competitive. State aids in the income tax and social insurance areas do not address on board work practices or manning requirements. They do not remove competition from low-fare airlines or prevent a reduction in passenger and car traffic. In recent times the ferry sector has been particularly hard hit by the loss of duty free sales; these sales <Col N="444"/>cushioned the sector against operating cost increases and reduced business.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We all recognise how essential it is that Ireland has modern quality ferries to service our key trading routes, particularly the Irish Sea routes and the routes to the Continent. Given that more than 95% of our trade is carried in ships, we are particularly vulnerable if those shipping services are curtailed. It would be regrettable if any form of industrial action were to jeopardise the economy by hindering our imports and exports.</P>
      <P>Where ships are registered is less important than in the past. Ireland&rsquo;s marine survey office regularly inspects ships calling at our ports to ensure their compliance with applicable international safety standards. That addresses the point raised by Deputy Ryan. The marine survey office supports State control and inspects ships without fear or favour irrespective of which flag they are flying.</P>
      <P>The living and working conditions of seafarers on those ships are regularly inspected by our port State control officers. These officers check, <i>inter alia,</i> that the ships they inspect are in compliance with the current main international labour organisation conventions, covering such matters as the provision of food supplies; cleanliness of galley and storage spaces; arrangements for holding, making and storing water; catering arrangements; accommodation spaces; ventilation, heating and lighting; sanitary facilities; that hospital accommodation is adequate, if required; medical certification; shipboard working arrangements; and seafarers&rsquo; hours of work.</P>
      <P>There is no question of sub-standard shipping being allowed to operate into and out of Irish ports. The Irish Maritime Development Office has estimated that the shipping services sector in Ireland has more than 8,000 employees, and contributed about &euro;1.45 billion to the economy in 2004.</P>
      <P>The sector covers not just the activities of our ship operators, but supports onshore activities in such areas as freight forwarding, ship broking, insurance, financial and legal services.</P>
      <P>In recent days the possibility of an EU initiative being used to address the current seafarer pay and employment issue was mentioned. There is no EU directive on the manning of regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between member states currently in force or being considered at present by member states. If the Commission was to initiate such a proposal, I would have no difficulty with that and would give it careful consideration.</P>
      <P>In 1998, there was an EU Commission proposal, COM/98/0251, concerning a Commission communication on a common policy on manning regular passenger and ferry services operating in and between member states. A key provision of the Commission&rsquo;s draft directive was its Article 2.2 which states that if the vessel used is not regis<Col N="445"/>tered in a member state, the terms and conditions referred to shall be those applicable to the residents of one of the member states between whose ports the service is provided and with which the service has the closest connection and that the closest connection shall be determined on the basis of the place from which the service is effectively managed.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament approved the proposal in March 1999. The Commission issued a revised proposal in 2000, COM/2000/0437. However, no final agreement was reached in the Council of Ministers on the matter and the Commission formally withdrew the proposal in August 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the Irish position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>At the time the proposal was being considered, Ireland was concerned about the economics of providing ferry services for peripheral Community regions, such as Ireland, particularly at off-peak seasons. We were also concerned that the Commission&rsquo;s proposals excluded non-ferry vessels in direct competition with ferries, since freight traffic is now becoming of more importance to jumbo ferry operators than the transport of passengers and their cars.</P>
      <P>To facilitate consideration of the matter, we were in favour of a study being undertaken to determine the implications of the proposals for peripheral Community regions such as our own. That would still be the case were the Commission to consider revisiting the matter in future.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ireland is a far more peripheral location than either the UK or France. We are reliant on maritime transport to address more than 95% of our trade needs. Recent statistics show that the Irish shipping sector handled an estimated &euro;120 billion worth of goods in 2004. That statistic alone underscores the importance of the sector in connecting the Irish economy with the global market place.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We have no rail link to take our trade to the continent, like the UK. For France, maritime transport is of relatively limited significance, in so far as trade with its Community partners is concerned. Any initiative to control seafarers&rsquo; pay on ferries operating between us and either of those countries, would therefore have to be carefully considered. We would have to consider the impact of any proposals on our competitiveness, trade and maritime sector as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker><Col N="446"/>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The competitiveness of our maritime sector has implications for employment in all sectors of the economy. Ireland has benefited, for instance, from the introduction of cutting-edge ferry technology on our principal Irish Sea route to the UK. The HSS fast ferry operated by Stena Line and the MV <i>Ulysses</i> operated by Irish Ferries, give Irish businesses access to the latest maritime technology. I am aware that some Deputies have advocated that a licensing arrangement should be put in place to control wages on ferries operating out of Ireland, similar to an arrangement in place in Scotland. An investigation of that matter indicates that the Scottish ferries concerned are used in the provision of island ferry services, operating under public service obligation contracts.</P>
      <P>There is no possibility of having such arrangements in place on the Irish Sea central corridor, where there is no shortage of private ferry operators willing to provide regular passenger and freight services without the need for a public service obligation.</P>
      <P>Last week in London, I took the opportunity to meet briefly with Dr. Stephen Ladyman, the British Minister responsible for transport. We had a discussion on how such matters could work between our two member states. That discussion was as far as I got on that occasion but I am anxious to pursue the issue of traffic between Ireland and the UK because it is important to us.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to request the Irish Maritime Development Office to carry out a thorough evaluation of the results of existing strategies to promote the Irish maritime sector, particularly in light of recent developments. That evaluation will include an examination of the successes achieved to date in promoting the sector and the issues to be addressed in going forward.</P>
      <P>I referred to the financial implications involved. In recent years the Government made a case to Europe to secure its approval for various incentives. The Government will continue to do that if necessary. Following an evaluation by my Department, the recommendations of the Irish Maritime Development Office will form the basis of a submission to Government.</P>
      <P>I urge all the parties to this dispute to sit down once more and try to hammer out an agreement on pay and work practices, which will meet the company&rsquo;s operating needs while being fair to its long-serving employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 150. I was there at the time but I had no control over that. It was not a matter for me to decide whether the jobs were redundant rather than the people being made redundant. I do not support such a thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Members on both sides of the House, I regret that it is once again necessary to return to this subject in the Chamber. It is the third time I have either answered questions or spoken on the Irish Ferries issue. While some little progress was made, I regret that it is necessary to continue to return to the subject. However, I welcome the opportunity to put on record with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, the Government&rsquo;s position on the situation.</P>
      <P>I propose to address a number of key issues. We have a comprehensive body of employment rights legislation, which has as its objective the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provision for the safety and health of workers and fostering labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness.</P>
      <P>While recognising the exceptional situation that has arisen in the maritime sector, it is important to remember that the full range of Irish employment law still applies to persons employed in Ireland, regardless of nationality. This body of law is being and will continue to be enforced.</P>
      <P>Governments cannot prevent job losses as such, which are a feature of a globalised world and an adaptive labour market. Accordingly, enterprises and sectors prosper and some decline, unless they remain competitive and meet the needs of customers. However, this is different from a situation where workers in viable enterprises are deliberately replaced by cheaper labour from other countries.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach has already told the D&aacute;il, free access to the Irish labour market by nationals of <Col N="448"/>the new EU member states was not intended to give employers a green light to replace Irish workers with cheaper labour.</P>
      <P>The consensus on economic and social policy issues that we have had in Ireland through successive national partnership programmes could not have been achieved without the existence of agreed social standards. This consensus approach involving employers, employees and Government has been a major contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s recent economic success and has been backed up by a well-balanced body of employment rights legislation and measures designed to stimulate employment that provide an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will be here tomorrow morning for the Second Stage of the Employment Permits Bill and I will be in the Seanad with the Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Bill. We are continuing to work to expand the range of employment law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>Both Bills are wholly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Employment rights legislation has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability. The economic benefits of employment security and agreed employment relationships in terms of co-operative work place relations, greater internal flexibility, acceptance of technological change, cumulative skills acquisition and greater incentive for investment in human resources are widely recognised and accepted.</P>
      <P>I note that the D&aacute;il is invited to condemn the replacement of existing workers who benefit from trade union pay rates with what are called &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; migrant workers. While not supporting the stance of the company in this matter, not all incoming workers can be described as &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; simply because they are working outside their country of origin. This is far too broad an assumption. While the term &ldquo;migrant worker&rdquo; is used in Ireland to describe virtually all workers from overseas, when questioned, people tend not to think of German, Italian, American or British nationals working in Ireland as migrant workers. Very many thousands of workers from overseas are in well-paid employment in the Irish economy. We cannot assume that everybody from overseas is vulnerable simply because they propose to work outside their own country. The Irish experience alone should provide ample evidence of that. We need to encourage workers to come from other countries and will continue to do so as it is important for the growth of employment here.</P>
      <P>From the information made available to us of what the company proposes, any replacement workers in Irish Ferries are likely to be EU <Col N="449"/>nationals, probably from the new member states. If such persons want to work outside their own country, they are free to seek work in Ireland, Sweden and the UK without restriction. Many thousands have availed of this opportunity. Many others have the possibility of seeking entry to specific occupations in other member states where the governments of those member states have opted to continue to regulate entry to their domestic labour market.</P>
      <P>However, I should point out that the legal advice received regarding foreign-registered ships indicates that as a general rule the flag state, the state where the ship is registered, has the exclusive right to exercise legislative and enforcement jurisdiction over its ships on the high sea. That advice was made known to the D&aacute;il in the middle of last year and everybody was aware of it. From the Government&rsquo;s perspective, there would be no question of granting work permits to an employer in a case like this to facilitate the bringing in of workers from outside the broader European Economic Area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>They have tens of thousands from eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was about to acknowledge the positive role played by the Deputy in one area. If this House and the public are to be convinced that this company is subject to the type of competitive pressures claimed, then much more information will be necessary together with a greater willingness to engage in dialogue with its workforce.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Preliminary advice has been received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office regarding whether or not a statutory redundancy situation will exist in Irish Ferries. As no formal communication has been received in the Department from the company regarding the exact nature of the proposed redundancies, this advice is based on media reports of what Irish Ferries intends to do. On the basis of the information available, the &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; may not fall within the definition in the Redundancy Payments Acts. Clarity can only be brought to the issue if, and when, the company makes a formal application to the Department for a redundancy rebate. In that event and in the event of disagreement it would be possible to refer the matter to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say that the company is not experiencing tougher competition in a rapidly changing environment. Neither am I in a position to say that changes in work practices at the company are not necessary to cope with new challenges. However, this matter should be addressed on the specifics of this case and not confused with wider issues relating to overseas workers in Ireland. Owing to the particular circumstances governing employment and regu<Col N="450"/>lation in the maritime sector, the emerging situation in Irish Ferries cannot simply be replicated in the wider economy, where the broad framework of Irish employment law and social protection will still apply.</P>
      <P>The Deputies proposing the motion request the House to condemn what is termed &ldquo;the growing tendency in areas such as construction, the meat industry, hotels and catering to exploit migrant labour at the expense of permanent jobs on trade union rates of pay and decent working conditions.&rdquo; It is important to bear in mind the distinction between what is illegal and what can be held to constitute exploitation. The former is set out in law while the latter tends to be much more subjective. The State is obliged to enforce employment law and conditions where these are regulated. It is also obliged to ensure to the greatest extent possible that persons are not brought into the State by employers likely to exploit such persons. In this regard, the House should note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has in recent years refused to grant new work permits to employers found to be abusing the facility. This can be and was done for clearly stated reasons of public policy and without any requirement to go to court. Certain cases were also referred to the Garda national immigration bureau for further investigation and where evidence warranted it, some employers have been prosecuted.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest factors putting workers in danger of exploitation is when an employee is working illegally within the State. This can come about through illegal entry, through overstaying a visitor&rsquo;s visa or through being otherwise in breach of the terms on which a person is admitted to the State. Employers who employ such persons are committing a criminal offence under the Employment Permits Act 2003 and, furthermore, they also stand to gain a competitive advantage over employers who meet their obligations under Irish employment law and who value and look after their workforce. Illegal working undercuts all those who are working legally. I urge all Deputies and all members of the public who may come across such illegal employment with its associated capacity for exploitation to report details to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to enable appropriate action to be taken.</P>
      <P>I am frequently disappointed to hear people, including occasionally Members in the House, make broad statements without giving specifics. Once details are made available to the Department, such issues will be pursued. I urge everybody to make such information available to the inspectors.</P>
      <P>In the rapidly expanding economy of recent years, it has become clear that an increase in the numbers employed in the labour inspectorate was necessary to assist in ensuring compliance with <Col N="451"/>the legal obligations of the many new enterprises. As Members will be aware, we are in the process of increasing the number of inspectors from 17 to 31. However, the Department, like other State agencies must also rely, to a large degree, on the assistance and information provided by other groups in civil society. While labour inspectors cannot be everywhere at once, they can certainly be deployed where a clear <i>prima facie</i> case has been made. In this regard, I would suggest to the House, in general, and to the Deputies who have raised this matter in particular, that they should bring the details of any specific breaches of employment law or conditions by specific employers in their constituencies to the attention of the Department. Deputy Joe Higgins made a very valuable contribution in this regard recently, based on evidence. This can assist greatly in ensuring a rapid and effective response. We will respond with a single-minded determination to gather evidence sufficient to prosecute transgressors. This applies to the sectors mentioned in the motion tabled by the Deputies opposite and to any other sectors where such problems arise.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland are very fortunate in the industrial relations systems we have developed together. The fundamental approach of successive Governments to industrial relations has been one of voluntarism. There is consensus among the social partners that the terms and conditions of employment of workers are best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and workers and between employers&rsquo; associations and one or more trade unions or staff associations. This approach to industrial relations has served us well over the years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In general, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties to a trade dispute, but rather are designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences. The State has, by and large, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of a framework and institutions through which good industrial relations can prosper. Institutions have been established that can assist in the resolution of disputes between employers and workers such as the Labour Relations Commission, including its rights commissioner service, the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>Our model for partnership is unique and adapted to Irish needs enabling us to manage rapid change successfully built on support for the changes necessary to meet our economic and societal goals of growth and employment. In addition, institutions of social partnership play a significant role in ensuring delivery of the industrial stability and peace provisions of the national agreements. In this context, the national implementation body serves as a forum where the Government, employers and trade unions can <Col N="452"/>work together to help ensure a positive industrial relations climate for economic and social progress. The national implementation body has played an important role in the Irish Ferries issue by calling on the parties to respond positively to an invitation from the Labour Court to both parties to meet for informal and exploratory discussions.</P>
      <P>To remain a competitive, growing economy, with the capacity to improve our social provision we must continue to build on what it has achieved for us. Over the past 18 years, if we have learned anything, it is that a shared analysis of the issues coupled with a problem-solving approach has worked.</P>
      <P>Social partnership, however, is not a recipe for perfection. Not everything works as planned. Not everyone complies with what is expected of them in the agreements. Imperfect as it is, however, it has delivered far more for each of the participants &mdash; all of us &mdash; than could possibly be achieved in the bad old days of confrontation and conflict. As rapid economic and social change continues, Irish society needs the stability provided by the partnership approach. Everyone has benefited. As the Taoiseach said this morning, everyone &mdash; employers, trade unions and the Government &mdash; has an obligation to contribute to its continuation. Those who are free riders on partnership and ignore its requirements on their behaviour should not be supported.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">However, honest engagement in a problem-solving way within the partnership process is an obligation on us all. There is no problem of employment relations which cannot be sensibly addressed through partnership, and none which can be addressed more effectively by abandoning partnership. If people have an alternative model to offer they should do so, but in the interim the benefits of partnership are clear to all.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While serious issues require to be addressed urgently in Irish Ferries, these can and should be progressed with the support and assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery. Accordingly, the initial reluctance of Irish Ferries to accede to the invitation from the Labour Court to discuss the proposed redundancy package was profoundly regrettable. However, Irish Ferries and the unions did attend the Labour Court on Monday, 3 October. Arising from the meeting, the company agreed to enter talks aimed at finding agreement by the end of October at the latest on its proposed redundancy package.</P>
      <P>In the light of those developments, normal industrial relations procedures are now being followed at Irish Ferries, which I welcome. This was not the case when I answered questions in the House last week. The services of the State&rsquo;s dispute-settling machinery of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court will continue to be at the disposal of the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="453"/>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan"><NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Perry.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes that the developments at Irish Ferries are very worrying. That a former State company would resort to such tactics in order to cut costs without the slightest concern for the workers whose livelihoods it is destroying is scandalous. Whatever captain of industry decided on this course of action and thought it was a good idea to shed workers in this cavalier fashion should be ashamed.</P>
      <P>The developments in Irish Ferries are significant not just because of those whom they directly affect. Every employee in the country is looking at Irish Ferries and saying &ldquo;soon, that could be me&rdquo;. We have a duty in this House to ensure that it does not become the norm, and the Government has a duty to ensure that other workers do not face the same situation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that issues of resentment of migrant workers as a result of the displacement of existing Irish workers should be fuelled by the irresponsible manner in which Irish Ferries has handled this issue. There is a more responsible way of acting and we would like to see more of that through the existing industrial relations machinery.</P>
      <P>In late 1999, Irish Ferries announced that it was to spend &euro;17 million to purchase the ship <i>MV Normandy.</i> It is extraordinary that only six years after such an enormous capital outlay, it is taking this &ldquo;remedial&rdquo; action. Further, in May 2005 it became known that Irish Ferries was one of the main beneficiaries of the so-called tonnage tax scheme to which the Minister of State referred. The company saved an estimated &euro;3 million in tax payments in 2003, the first year of the scheme&rsquo;s operation. It was made clear at that time that without the tax break, &ldquo;jobs at Irish Ferries would be lost&rdquo;. So much for tax schemes, for solid investment, for planning for the future, and a strategic development plan for a company. It does not augur well for the future of a company with such managerial experience.</P>
      <P>The House will be well aware that Irish Ferries became an industrial relations pariah when it decided it was perfectly acceptable to pay one of its employees &euro;1 per hour to work on one of its ships &mdash; and all of this from a company that apparently buys into social partnership, a project that has served us well and served the company well over the years.</P>
      <P>Irish Ferries accordingly stands accused, but so too does the Government. This country is a small island nation and needs two things in particular among many others: a dynamic, competition-led shipping sector and a Government determined to ensure the competitiveness of the Irish economy. Ireland currently has neither. The Taoiseach might attempt to look tough by vaguely threatening Irish Ferries over its actions but he has done little to provide the company with a dynamic, <Col N="454"/>low-cost economy. We are living in a global competitive world economy and must contain costs. The Government stands negligent on this front. It has introduced stealth tax after stealth tax and charge after charge, which has ensured that indigenous Irish jobs in the manufacturing and maritime sectors are now at risk, as particularly exemplified by Irish Ferries.</P>
      <P Just="Left">People have heard me regularly in this House listing all the stealth taxes and charges so I will not bore the House with them. Nevertheless, VAT, vehicle registration tax and motor tax have all increased. All the various energy sectors which feed into a modern competitive economy are now out of control as a result of the regulators, endorsed by Government policy, who are ensuring that we have a 25% increase in energy costs alone from 1 October of this year. That is not an acceptable way of ensuring that we have a modern, progressive, competitive and globally orientated economy. Ireland has gone from fourth in 2000 to 26th this year in the World Economic Forum&rsquo;s global competitiveness report, mainly as a result of the failure to control our prices. The Government&rsquo;s own body, the National Competitiveness Council, says Irish prices rose 22% more than those in other EU countries in the years 1999-2003.</P>
      <P>The Government fails to see that every policy influences another, and if Irish Ferries did not face high costs elsewhere it would be harder for it to engage in its &ldquo;poor mouth&rdquo; antics and claim it was necessary to take the approach it seems intent on taking.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government once again to get to grips with the cost base we are facing. We have seen that the manufacturing sector is in difficulty, with 20,000 jobs lost since 1999, notwithstanding our low overall level of unemployment. We risk endangering the value added economy we have done so much to build if we do not start to take remedial steps now to make it cheaper and easier to do business in this country.</P>
      <P>These are the issues which organisations like IBEC in particular should be highlighting with Government, rather than sleepwalking through the existing social partnership process. Recent comments by IBEC regarding the dispute at Irish Ferries were astounding. IBEC said:</P>
      <P LI="1">The issue now for the trade unions is to decide whether it is better to have several hundred moderately paid Irish jobs remaining in Irish Ferries or to have no jobs at all.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That type of threatening attitude does nothing for social partnership and is not the constructive approach required to resolve this dispute. We now know that as far as IBEC is concerned, employers have the right to do whatever they want because it is better to be treated disgracefully by one&rsquo;s boss than to be on the dole.</P><Col N="455"/>
      <P>I share IBEC&rsquo;s concern about the cost base of Irish Ferries but I do not share its attitude to resolving the dispute. I abhor the abuse of a system designed to protect workers for Irish Ferries&rsquo; own ends. The Government is the guardian of the rights of citizens. If it turns out that those rights are being circumvented then it has a case to answer. I call on unions to take the moral high ground on this issue and use the existing mechanisms of social partnership and the Labour Court to resolve the crisis, as they have been asking to do, particularly SIPTU.</P>
      <P>I do not advocate the action proposed by some, that the ports of the nation be ground to a halt, which will do nothing to resolve the dispute but harm the economy, damage our competitiveness and destroy jobs. That is not a responsible and constructive way to proceed. We cannot allow a situation to occur where goods are prevented from leaving or coming to this jurisdiction because of the disgraceful actions of one wayward ferry company.</P>
      <P>Social partnership works, as does the Labour Court. Let us use them to resolve this dispute. We must have a competitive economy, but people who are working hard in Irish companies deserve respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision by Irish Ferries to take this action represents a huge strategic loss to the country. The move does not bode well for the sector and we must be prepared for massive changes in Irish seafaring. The Government must take the blame for this strategic loss. The bottom line is that the Government has failed the Irish Ferries workers, the seafaring industry and all Irish people by failing to take action earlier. This lack of foresight on the Government&rsquo;s part has cost Irish Ferries&rsquo; staff their jobs.</P>
      <P>The writing has been on the wall for Irish Ferries for several years but the Government has failed to act time and again. The issue of additional tax breaks was first raised three years ago with this Government. A year ago Irish Ferries started planning to outsource workers on the Normandy route, which serves Cherbourg and Roscoff. It is a damning indictment that the Government failed to take action before now. The action of Irish Ferries is hugely regrettable. It will have a far reaching impact not alone on the families directly involved but on the seafaring industry.</P>
      <P>The National Maritime College recently opened in Ringaskiddy at a cost to the taxpayer of &euro;51 million. The purpose of this college is to train seafarers. It is unfortunate that there was no partnership approach with employers on the future opportunities that could be developed with this facility. Now, one of the major employers is taking the cheaper option when employing staff. Creation of educational institutions is always wel<Col N="456"/>come but must have a clear focus on employment for the student involved and future job potential. It is pointless to encourage a student to spend a number of years studying a discipline in which he or she may never find a job or in which he or she will have to compete with people who will work for half the cost. The awful reality is that the Government&rsquo;s lack of forward thinking has meant that opportunities for graduates coming from this college are now considerably reduced. As Irish Ferries is the largest employer of Irish seafarers, the company&rsquo;s decision will have enormous repercussions for those attending the college.</P>
      <P>The Irish Maritime Development Office is charged with the development of the shipping sector. This agency recently reviewed the shipping sector&rsquo;s existing State aids. The agency also considered the case for new or modified aids. A report was compiled, which recommended the implementation of several State aids. Such State aids were originally recommended to this Government three years ago. If action had been taken when it could have made a difference, the Irish seafaring industry could now have a completely different outlook. This report is now with the Department of Finance. What action is being taken?</P>
      <P>Irish people have had enough lip service from this Government. They need action. However, the Government appears to be far too keen to spend vast amounts of money hiring consultants to compile reports that sit on Ministers&rsquo; desks. The agency report is available but no action was taken even though it would have a direct impact on the employment and retention of staff.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What happened? It is still with the Government. The Government has also failed to re-introduce the PRSI rebate scheme. This scheme would allow for PRSI paid by employers of Irish based seafarers to be refunded. Naturally such a scheme makes an enormous difference to employers&rsquo; balance sheets. It costs an employer &euro;100 to pay an employee &euro;500. Consider how much it costs to pay 500 employees. That scheme was operational until 2003.</P>

	<P>We reintroduced it and we are waiting for feedback from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Why has the Government not acted before now to reintroduce this scheme? What has happened since 2004? This involves a 20% cost factor on the creation of a seafaring job. If that reduction had been in place, Irish Ferries could not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The company knew it was being reintroduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is two years since that scheme finished. The Government was aware of how beneficial the scheme was to the industry so why was this decision not referred to the European Commission two years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been there for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not good enough. If the scheme was still in place, Irish Ferries would not have justification for the action it is now taking. That is the simple truth. This Government has acted recklessly with the jobs of 543 Irish Ferries workers. Responsibility must be taken for this. The PRSI rebate that should have been renewed would have made a difference. PRSI is a huge cost and this involved a discount of 20% in employer costs. I do not condone the action taken by Irish Ferries but a large degree of blame for these job losses rests with this Government and its inaction.</P>
      <P>The concerns of Irish seafarers were simply ignored in recent years. Irish Ferries&rsquo; announcement of this outrageous decision of all but compulsory redundancy shows the level of priority this Government gives to maritime issues. I respect the Minister of State&rsquo;s work as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine but there is no Cabinet Minister with direct responsibility for maritime affairs for our island nation. That has had an impact not only on this issue but on several others. Our island status cannot be ignored. However, the Government stance of appointing a Minister of State to deal with this important portfolio shows the lack of concern it has for many of the most basic needs of this country. It cannot be sufficiently emphasised that respect must be given to maritime affairs.</P>
      <P>One of Irish Ferries&rsquo; chief competitors is Brittany Ferries, which is highly subsidised by the French Government. Irish Ferries is not a State owned company and has not been since 1992. However, we must examine what measures could be introduced to stop a major employer implementing a severance package. As an island nation <Col N="458"/>this is a national question and we need to deal with it as such. There is a report sitting on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s, desk which must be examined with great urgency. I am astonished it has not been dealt with before now. There have been many debates about this. It is simply a matter of seeking a derogation in Europe with regard to PRSI but that was not done. What is the status of this report? It is imperative that the Department of Finance acts fast and considers it.</P>
      <P>The announcement that a public consultation process on the re-flagging of ships is being set up is also a welcome development. Again, however, the Government seems to have staggered blindly for a considerable period and is only now realising that action must be taken. The decision to re-flag the <i>MV Normandy</i> was taken by Irish Ferries at the start of this year. The decision was known to have been on the cards for a considerable time. The Department officially sought public opinion on the issue on 17 August last. Where is the forward thinking and logic in this?</P>
      <P>The aim of the consultation process is to open discussion on improvements to the current ship registration system. It also intends to develop a new and integrated policy on the registration of vessels for the future. This is a good step but it is more than a year too late. A problem on the Normandy route was first identified in 2004 but the current consultation period continues to the end of December this year. Why is the Government so devastatingly unable to take decisions when they are needed?</P>
      <P>The demands in this motion must be examined. The Government must urgently introduce legislation to outlaw ship owners and operators who use flags of convenience to ignore workers&rsquo; rights. We have not brought this country so far in terms of employment legislation only to allow companies to exploit foreign workers within our waters. Workers on ferries flying under flags of convenience are paid less than half our minimum wage. That is not good enough. The vast majority of Irish employers treat their staff fairly and this is only proper and should be the least one should expect. However, allowing foreign workers to work on our waters for low wages is the shame of this Government. This has now been happening for nine months. The <i>MV Normandy</i> re-flagged itself to operate under the flag of the Bahamas eight months before this consultation process was announced. What action did the Government take in the interim? It was highly hypocritical of the Government to denounce in the House the decision of Irish Ferries and then pay a grant worth millions of euro to the same company when 150 workers on the <i>MV Normandy</i> were made redundant.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of talk from the Government but it must understand that Irish people are sick and tired of hearing all this talk but seeing <Col N="459"/>no action. The growing tendency to exploit workers in a variety of employment areas must be stopped. Irish people were often exploited when they went abroad to find work when the economy was not performing as well as now and it is horrendous to see the same exploitation being repeated. Foreign workers in Ireland should be openly encouraged to join trade unions. There are reports of employers who discourage and do not allow union membership and such people should feel the full force of the law.</P>
      <P>The Government has failed the seafarers of this country. Its inaction in the past year and a half has allowed Irish Ferries to make this outrageous announcement. It is difficult to understand the reasons for the failure of the Government&rsquo;s incentives to encourage job retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to respond to points which have arisen in the debate. The Green Party spokesperson on transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, criticised different Government Deputies. He was critical of the Minister, Deputy Martin, for his absence from the House. He is obviously unaware that the Minister is out of the country at an EU Council meeting. Deputy Ryan only stayed in the Chamber for approximately 15 minutes yet he was highly critical of both Ministers of State, Deputies Gallagher and Killeen, each of whom has been present for a considerably longer period. They contributed to the debate and listened attentively to the contributions of those in the House. I respectfully suggest Deputy Ryan should take a leaf out of their respective books.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry has accused the Government of failing Irish seafarers. I refute this charge which is opportunistic, to put it mildly. We are dealing with an unfortunate idiosyncrasy of modern employment law and the equivalent of latter-day pirates. International law relating to flags of convenience and general shipping laws relating to the use of flags can be exploited utterly by anybody with a mind to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>They may be corrected by any Government with a mind to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of exploitation of those laws by this Government and anything like that is quite unfair and opportunistic.</P>

	<P>Neither capitalism nor socialism but idiosyncrasy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is piracy on the part of a company with a recent semi-State history which has availed of an opportunity and decided to exploit it to the full. It is a weakness in international law which is difficult to circumvent. The laws applying in such circumstances are not the laws of this country.</P><Col N="460"/>
      <P>The partnership forum is the appropriate forum for the development of goodwill between both sides. With the best will in the world, no Government nor any aspirational Government could possibly deal with the situation in a manner other than has been adopted by this Government. I cannot call the action taken by Irish Ferries illegal because it is not illegal in the strict sense but it is wrong, immoral and utterly unacceptable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should make it illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and outside the spirit of the framework of any law. It is the responsibility of the Government to look after the employees as best it can. I am confident the Ministers of State, Deputies Gallagher and Killeen, are discharging their duties to the full and will be seen in due course to have done so.</P>
      <P>I refer to a number of points addressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, in his contribution. He stated that employment rights legislation in this country has as its objective the protection of employees against arbitrary behaviour by employers, provision for the safety and health of workers and the fostering of labour market harmony by promoting policies that minimise conflict and maximise fairness. This situation is exceptional. Irish employment law only applies to persons employed in this country, regardless of their nationality and it does not apply to persons who are employed outside this State. For the purposes of this dispute, the Irish flag and jurisdiction does not apply to the company even though it is an Irish-based company. Employment law is enforced and will continue to be enforced but it is unfortunate that in this instance, Irish law has no jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should change the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimGlennonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Glennon</NameTxt>
	<P>If the law could be changed as glibly and with such facility as a comment across the floor of the House, it would be a great thing to do. It would be wonderful if it were all that simple. The Deputy knows that Irish law cannot be extended to an area over which the State has no jurisdiction. Irish law cannot be applied automatically to a ship sailing in and out of Ireland or indeed to an aircraft. Ireland once had a fine merchant shipping fleet and it is a pity it is no longer there. Irish ships sailing into international ports would not wish to be subjected to the laws of certain countries nor should they be expected to be.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise an important issue, namely the cost over-runs in the preparation and production of Irish passports and the payment of royalties to contractors for each passport issued. This is another example of the taxpayer forking out for the golden fleeces that we have seen so many of in recent times. There have been at least 13 major cock-ups in public expenditure on capital programmes, the largest of which is the personnel, payroll and related system, PPARS, costing &euro;150 million to date, while the original estimate was &euro;8.8 million. I do not have sufficient time to go through all 13 examples, but on the passport system, the Minister must answer some questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Why was the provision of the automated passport system so much more expensive than had originally been estimated? The Minister must also explain why a royalty must be paid by the taxpayer every time the new system is used. According to the 2004 annual report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the costs for the provision of the new automated passport system, for which a contract was signed in late 2002, was &euro;21.819 million. This cost is 60% higher than that estimated only two years earlier, when a figure of &euro;13.559 million was recommended by the Department of Foreign Affairs. While the development of new technologies in the period from 2000 to 2002 may account for some of the increase in cost, the total price of the contract is still significantly higher than anticipated. The Minister must clarify the situation and outline the reasons for the large increase in costs.</P>
        <P>In addition, the contract for the automated passport system provided for the exclusive purchase of blank passport booklets and data pages from the contractor and payment of a royalty for each passport issued. Based on an output of 650,000 passports, the cost to the taxpayer under this specific arrangement is approximately &euro;4.76 million per annum. For each passport produced, the contractor receives more than &euro;7 from the State. Having spent almost &euro;22 million on this new automated passport system, the Minister must clarify why the taxpayer must also pay a royalty to the contractor each and every time the system is used. I also wish to know who owns the intellectual property rights to the new automated system and whether this matter was dealt with in the contract. Taxpayers have paid for the development of a new system. Will they see any dividends if this system is used elsewhere?</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>Two other issues are detailed on page 80 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report. First, legal fees rose from &euro;47,000 to over &euro;294,000, a seven fold increase. Second, it was estimated that a minimum of 40 days assistance would be required for project management. A fixed price per service day was required and the <i>per diem </i>rate varied between &euro;480 and &euro;1,450, depending on the particular consultant engaged. At the time of the audit carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, some &euro;423,000 had been paid for these services which, at the maximum rate, would represent 290 days work by consultants.</P>
        <P>These are serious questions and I ask the Minister to reply to each point raised and give an explanation to this House for the gross misspending of hard earned taxpayers&rsquo; money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has had to travel north to a meeting this evening with Northern Secretary of State Peter Hain.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the tenure of the rainbow Government our passport system was allowed to deteriorate to a wholly unacceptable level. To produce just over half of the number of passports which we will issue this year, the public was subject to queues and lengthy delays on a daily basis. The hallmark of the Irish passport system when the parties opposite were last in Government was queues around the block at Molesworth Street and down Kildare Street. Many in this House would have witnessed those queues on their way in and out of Leinster House week after week.</P>
        <P>This Government set about repairing this unfortunate situation. This has been done with success and with value for taxpayers&rsquo; money. Our automated passport system fully meets all international specifications, is widely regarded as one of the most secure in the entire world and has been described by the US administration as absolutely superb.</P>
        <P>The system was never estimated to cost &euro;3 million or &euro;13.5 million. All assertions to that effect are totally without foundation or substance and the parties opposite are well aware of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State should take that up with the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There were various early estimations of the cost of upgrading the old system but not for implementing the new state-of-the-art passport system. Again, the Deputies opposite are aware of this fact. The contract price, which is the only relevant estimate, for our automated passport system was &euro;21.8 million in 2002. It will <Col N="463"/>actually cost &euro;27.7 million on completion. These additional moneys are mainly for additional security features in the new passport system necessitated by tightened passport entry requirements in the US following 11 September 2001. Had we failed to introduce these new security features following 11 September while we had the chance, the Deputies opposite would rightly have accused us of negligence.</P>
        <P>The additional moneys were also used to introduce the express passport system into Northern Ireland, where there are over 40 post offices now processing Irish passports. This year 26,000 people in Northern Ireland will avail of this new service.</P>
        <P>The passport project was, at all times, conducted within Department of Finance guidelines and it avoided the severe problems experienced by other countries in moving to a new passport system. It also allowed Ireland to remain within the US visa waiver scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputy Allen has asserted that &euro;5 million will be spent on royalties but the actual figure will be in the region of &euro;360,000 or 52 cents per passport. The sum of 52 cents per passport is paid for the use of patented software technology used in producing the passports. This is a far cry from the &euro;5 million claimed by Deputy Allen, which is nothing short of a political lie. As the Deputy knows &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With respect to the House, to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and to Deputy Allen I rephrase my sentence. This is far cry from the &euro;5 million claimed by Deputy Allen, which is nothing short of a fabrication. The Deputy knows that the &euro;4.76 million referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report for recurring costs in the main applies to the purchase of state-of-the-art passport booklets which feature specialised data pages capable of holding digital photographs and other information vital for passport security and fraud prevention. That is the cost of safeguarding our passports&rsquo; credibility and providing the potential to build in additional security and anti-fraud features and any reasonable person would accept that.</P>
        <P>This debate underlines the Fine Gael tactic of shifting base lines to vastly exaggerate over-spending, to the detriment of the State, its systems and officers for naked political opportunism. It is part of a political tactic to project that party&rsquo;s own record of fiscal incompetence on to <Col N="464"/>this Government. Fine Gael has no fiscal spine and is not tenable in the long-term. It is the party which brought us a 27% rise in hospital waiting lists, an 11% fall in local authority housing output, a £1.80 rise in the old aged pension, the Eircom shareholder compensation plan and the taxi driver compensation plan. It will never be the party of fiscal propriety.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I am attempting to find out the plans of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to tackle the annual epidemic of fireworks in the run-up to Hallowe&rsquo;en. The Hallowe&rsquo;en season is upon us and the annual sale, distribution and indiscriminate use of illegal fireworks, which often end up in the hands of young people, is in full swing.</P>
        <P>Each year the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promises to introduce legislation to curb this illegal activity, but so far he has produced nothing. Unbelievably, it is now reported in the media that he is seeking derogation from a forthcoming European Union directive which aims to establish a common policy to regulate and control the sale, distribution and use of fireworks throughout the member states.</P>
        <P>It appears everyone is out of step except the Minister. Elderly people are terrified in their homes and on the street, with bangers going off night and day. Young people, ignorant of the potential dangers of handling fireworks which are literally miniature explosives are liable to serious injury at any time. Two weeks ago, at the National Ploughing Championships, &euro;365,000 worth of fireworks were seized by the Garda. At the Ballinasloe horse fair last week the Garda reported numerous fireworks seizures and horses were stampeded by sudden explosions of fireworks.</P>
        <P>While fireworks are currently banned by law in the Republic they are available everywhere. They are not banned in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, while they are subject to restrictions on their usage. Surely the first step for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to contact his counterparts in Northern Ireland to put together and discuss a common policy to control and regulate fireworks on an all-island basis. Instead of seeking a unilateral derogation for this country, having got a common <Col N="465"/>approach in Ireland, he should be able to argue a common European Union policy that would allow for common control and common regulation among all the 25 member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He should then make regulations so that local authorities would be obliged to take responsibility for good order in the communities for which they have responsibility in the run-up to Hallowe'en. They should play a proactive role in the organisation of safe firework events and alternative Hallowe'en activities for young people. For example, household junk collections should not take place in October or September as is the case in Dublin at present. This allows all sorts of inflammable materials to be collected. They are readily available to all young people who wish to get them ahead of the corporation trucks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is needed is a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is prepared to show leadership on this issue and ensure we have safety and security throughout the country at Hallowe'en each year. We do not need a Minister who promises each year that he will do the devil and all with the end result that there is nothing to show for it and there is the same fear and threat to elderly people, particularly in housing estates and complexes throughout the country and the same danger to young people who have no proper knowledge on how to handle these explosive materials.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that he cannot attend the Adjournment debate here this evening.</P>
        <P>The Minister is fully aware of the difficulties the illegal use of fireworks present each year around this time, the dangers they pose and the distress they cause to people, particularly the elderly. Conscious of this, last February, the Minister published a &ldquo;Fireworks Policy Consultation Document&rdquo; and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the Explosives Act 1875 which govern fireworks.</P>
        <P>The 1875 Act provides for control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks. While current Irish law on fireworks does not specifically ban the importation, manufacture, sale or use of fireworks, it is Government policy in the interests of safety and security to restrict to the greatest extent possible, the availability of any category of firework to the general public. Effect is given to this policy through the use of the licensing powers conferred on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by the 1875 Act. The Act provides that fireworks may only be imported into Ireland on foot of an importation licence granted by the Minister. It is <Col N="466"/>current policy to only issue licences for the importation of fireworks used in organised displays, conducted by professional or competent operators. In effect, this policy means that the only fireworks imported into the State and legally held here are those used in professional displays. All other fireworks imported, held, sold or used here are illegal and any person in possession of fireworks without a valid importation licence is liable to prosecution.</P>
        <P>The Minister has received a wide range of submissions in response to the &ldquo;Fireworks Policy Consultation Document&rdquo;. It is clear from these submissions that among the options for change outlined in the consultation document there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, the Minister proposes to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which is currently before the House to bring forward on Committee Stage of that Bill, amendments which will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. He also proposes to significantly increase penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <P>In so far as the seizure of fireworks by the Garda authorities is concerned every effort is made by the Garda to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks. Where necessary, specific policing plans are put in place in areas where particular problems arise. These plans include intelligence-gathering on known dealers and suppliers and, once identified, putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks. Each year, leading up to Halloween, special efforts are made to combat the illegal importation of fireworks. This year, an intelligence-led operation called &lsquo;Operation Tombola&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;which aims to prevent and detect the organised importation of fireworks for sale, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner. In this context, chief superintendents throughout the country have been instructed to introduce measures appropriate to their respective areas of responsibility with particular emphasis on Garda divisions in the Dublin Metropolitan region and in Border regions. The operation, while being intelligence-driven, is coupled with sporadic high visibility policing activities.</P>
        <P>Over the past five years, such operations have resulted in significant seizures of illegally imported fireworks with an estimated value of &euro;2 <Col N="467"/>million. Already this year, as Deputies will be aware from recent media reports, &ldquo;Operation Tombola&rdquo; has resulted in the seizure of very large consignments of illegally imported fireworks. All fireworks seized are forfeited by the person importing them and destroyed in accordance with the provisions of the Explosives Act 1875.</P>
        <P>I now turn to the question of the draft EU directive on fireworks, which is currently being discussed by the EU Commission. The objective of this directive is to establish rules designed to achieve the free movement of pyrotechnic articles-fireworks throughout EU member states while ensuring a high degree of protection for the consumer. The main thrust of the draft directive is to achieve the free movement of fireworks throughout the EU. While the directive makes certain provisions relating to safety, Ireland is not satisfied that the measures being proposed are sufficient.</P>

	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
        <P>The adult education services in Mayo do magnificent work in helping adults with learning disabilities to acquire new skills, including reading and writing. A bombshell, however, has been dropped. This wonderful adult education service provided by Mayo VEC is in jeopardy. A letter dated 5 October was received by tutors which stated that due to a lack of funding to meet increased costs, it will be necessary to cancel all further literacy tuition in County Mayo between October and December 2005. The letter states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Due to a lack of budget to meet increased costs, I have been informed by the chief executive officer that it will be necessary to cancel all further literacy tuition for the period October-December 2005. I shall be grateful, therefore, if you would inform all tutors and students that classes will cease as and from Friday, 14 October. We regret this action is necessary and contact has been made with the Department of Education in an attempt to get an increased allocation.</P>
        <P LI="1">Pat Staunton</P>
        <P LI="1">Adult Education Officer</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is a total and utter disgrace that people who have gone to the trouble to learn how to read and write should be treated this way. As a result, 700 literacy students must finish their tuition by the end of the week. It is terrible news for them and they have received it at short notice. More than 1,000 back to education initiative students must also conclude their studies by the end of the month. It is a total and utter calamity for those <Col N="468"/>people and it is a disgrace that this can be allowed to happen. They are the most vulnerable in our society. They have reading difficulties but they have taken the brave step to participate in adult education.</P>
        <P>It is sad that the people who are least able to help themselves and who have gone to a great deal of trouble to enrol themselves in adult education courses with great success should be thwarted in this way. It is unacceptable and unforgivable. These vulnerable people should not be the subject of a cutback and they deserve better.</P>
        <P>The Mayo adult education service run by Pat Staunton and his team do good work with people. Margaret Kelly, Marian Cusack in Ballina, Lisal Mercroft in Achill and the 50 tutors are engaged in pioneering work and they are victims of their own success. They were told they would require a minimum of 232 pupils this year but they have attracted more than 1,000 students, a mark of their success. Their target was 45,000 hours contact but they have achieved 85,000 hours. They were encouraged to do this by the Department but their magnificent work is in jeopardy.</P>
        <P>The 50 tutors deserve better than this given their wonderful track record, enterprise and pioneering spirit. They have helped many people with reading and writing difficulties, for whom such difficulties were a life sentence as they were unable to get on as well as they should. This service is superb.</P>
        <P>Child care and health care support courses were also provided through the service. Students were due to gain a FETAC award next May. This is a nationally recognised award, which would be the pinnacle of their success. However, if the cessation of the teaching programme goes ahead, as planned, it will have catastrophic consequences for the students. If they cannot pursue their courses through November and December, they will not be ready for their award, as they will not have enough modules completed by May, which would be a calamity.</P>
        <P>This cutback has serious implications for these students. I ask the Minister to provide &euro;100,000, funding which should have been anticipated and benchmarked. It should have been factored into the budget. I blame the Minister totally for this and I call on her to act immediately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn"><NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Between 40 and 50 tutors employed by Mayo VEC were informed last week that the back to education and literacy courses they were running would be suspended at the end of the month and the end of the week, respectively, due to an increase in administration costs, which meant that money ran out. This affects 50 tutors, 700 literacy students and 1,600 <Col N="469"/>back to education initiative students who are doing a FETAC level 2 course in child care and health care support. This is disappointing news, with serious consequences for everybody involved, particularly they were given short notice towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>Eight weeks of the courses, which would have taken students up to Christmas, have been suspended and it is planned that they will recommence at the start of next year. However, the loss of eight weeks will have serious implications for the timing and scheduling of the course and the awarding of qualifications.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State can shed light on this issue. The funding for these courses amounts to &euro;500,000 in 2005. Mayo was the first county to initiate the national adult literacy programme and the service is well regarding by the Department and throughout the country. Many other counties have followed the example of the excellent literacy programme content provided by Mayo VEC. Excellent results have been achieved, hence the popularity of the programme within the country, which has addressed what was a hidden condition until recent years.</P>
        <P>It is a brave step for a person who leaves school without the necessary reading and writing skills to take up the challenge of a literacy course. They are an essentially vulnerable group. Why are they being targeted? Is it because it is highly unlikely a person on a literacy course will step forward as a spokesperson to state this situation is completely unacceptable and money should be put in place? These people are trying to achieve competence in the area of literacy and they are particularly vulnerable. It is a cynical exercise to target this course.</P>
        <P>I refer to the back to education initiative, which concentrates mainly on unemployed people. However, many of them have paid for the course in full out of their own pockets in the expectation of gaining a qualification next May. The certificates under the FETAC level 2 programme are due to be presented in May 2006 and the scheduling of the course facilitates job applications for child care and health care support vacancies. Given the sudden suspension of the final eight weeks of the course this year, what implication will that have for the scheduling of the course? Will the eight weeks be added on at the end? How will this affect the new courses, which are due to commence in 2006?</P>
        <P>Why was there no forward planning? Everybody must have recognised administrative costs would increase towards the end of the year. Why was that not anticipated? If it was anticipated, were additional resources requested from the Department? What was its response?</P>
        <P>The people affected comprise vulnerable groups in our society. It is a shame that they have <Col N="470"/>been hit. It is incumbent on me, therefore, as a public representative for County Mayo to speak on behalf of these silent voices on this issue. Both students and tutors are affected. I call on the Minister to make available as a matter of urgency the funding required to enable the County Mayo VEC to complete the adult literacy and BTEI programmes without interruption and to reassure the participants that all such courses will be completed on schedule.</P>

	<P>I propose to address the issues raised by Deputies Cowley and Flynn together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science was contacted by the chief executive officer of County Mayo Vocational Education Committee, Mr. Joseph Langan, last week on the matter. My officials requested that further details be submitted in writing. I am informed that no further communication has been received so far and we await a response.</P>

        <P>The adult literacy services are delivered locally by vocational educational committees under the budget for the adult literacy community education scheme and the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme. The national position regarding the allocations is as follows. All VECs were notified by letter from my Department on 30 March 2005 of their provision for 2005 in terms of their further education programmes. These include the adult literacy and community education programme, the back to education initiative, the vocational training opportunities scheme, post-leaving certificate courses, senior traveller training centres and Youthreach.</P>
        <P>The provision to County Mayo VEC for the adult literacy programme in 2005 is &euro;422,187, as against an allocation of &euro;406,176 for 2004. This represents an increase of 10.39%, one of the highest percentage increases to any of the VECs. The corresponding increase in the overall subhead was 9%. This increase was in recognition of the demographic factors and the dispersed nature of the population in that county. VECs are expected to plan for their annual adult literacy programmes within the budget provided. With regard to its literacy budget, Mayo VEC received one instalment in April and a second instalment is due for issue this month. The number of literacy clients for 2004 was 660.</P>
        <P>In March 2005, County Mayo Vocational Education Committee was notified by the Department of a budget allocation amounting to &euro;529,000 in respect of back to education initiative programmes for the financial period January to December 2005. Within the BTEI programme, approval was given for 16 child care courses. Approximately 232 places and 45,405 tutor hours are being supported. An initial payment of 60% of the budget allocation, &euro;292,002, was paid to <Col N="471"/>County Mayo VEC in early May 2005. The balance of &euro;236,998 allocated for this year is due to be paid following the receipt and reconciliation of approved financial statements from the VEC in respect of 2004.</P>
        <P>The CEO of County Mayo VEC has recently requested a meeting with the further education development unit to discuss the financial reconciliation data. The VEC has also requested an extra &euro;50,000 in respect of additional activity. In <Col N="472"/>the event that the normal financial reconciliation is agreed between the Department and the VEC, the balance of BTEI programme funding will be issued to the VEC shortly. Requests for increased funding will not be considered at this time because the 2005 budget for the BTEI has been allocated to VECs, schools and community strand providers already.</P>

	<P>In the five years since 2000 my Department has spent &euro;39.2 million on the rental of temporary school accommodation, mainly in primary schools. In addition, my Department spent &euro;73.5 million over the same period, on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in the primary and post-primary sectors.</P>
        <P>This expenditure was for the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings including associated site works and other costs, such as for compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, connections for water, electricity and sewage, represents less than 5% of the total expenditure on school buildings &mdash;&euro;1.6 billion &mdash; over the five year period from 2000 to the end of 2004.</P>
        <P>The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly in recent years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity rough the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.</P>
        <P>The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. To reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level an initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded to 44 primary schools in 2004 and more than 70 schools were invited to participate in this initiative in 2005.</P>
        <P>As a result of this initiative the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in 2004 was just half of what had been spent in 2003.</P><Col N="474"/>
        <P>Applications for funding through this initiative, during 2006, are currently being received in my Department. The closing date for receipt of these applications is next Friday, 14 October.</P>

        <P>Installation of the management information system for the 14 institutes of technology and the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute has been completed.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The MIS system comprises four integrated elements &mdash; a student registration system, a financial system, a payroll-human resource system and a library system. The system tracks all student records including registration, courses, link modules and examination performance. The financial system provides for individual budget responsibility within the institutes and it produces annual accounts. The payroll-human resource system links with the student system to facilitate time-tabling. The library system tracks all movements of materials and also facilitates on-line access to journals and articles by students and staff.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The project involved some 59 installations of hardware and software across the institutions. By the end of 2004, 57 of the 59 installations had been completed and the remaining two were completed this year. The cost of the project was &euro;44.8 million.</P>
        <P>I understand the MIS has proved to be a critical and decisive element in the modernisation and transformation of the management and operation of the institutes of technology. It has produced major benefits for students.</P>
        <P>The project was implemented by a consortium of the institutes with the lead role on the day to day management undertaken by the Dublin Institute of Technology. The detailed information on the consultancy elements of the cost is being compiled and I will forward the information to the Deputies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 107 together.</P>
        <P>Third level student support is currently provided through three means-tested maintenance grant schemes. The higher education grants scheme operates on a statutory basis, while the vocational education committees&rsquo; scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees operate on an administrative basis. The statutory framework for maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme is set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education. This will provide for a more coherent administration system which will facilitate consistency of application and improved client accessibility. This is necessary if we are to ensure public confidence in the awards system and ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.</P>
        <P>My Department has been engaged in ongoing consultations with the key stakeholders such as the Irish Vocational Educational Association, the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, various social partners and other relevant Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, in order to map the most logical and effective arrangements for the future structure and administration of the student support schemes.</P>
        <P>These discussions have substantially clarified the positions of the stakeholders in relation to the future administration possibilities for student support and their possible role.</P>
        <P>I expect to be in a position shortly to determine the best strategy to give effect to the programme for Government commitment to the payment of the maintenance grants through a unified and flexible payment scheme.</P>
        <P>Whatever new arrangements are eventually decided upon will be provided for, as I previously indicated, in new statutory arrangements through a Student Support Bill. This Bill, which will provide statutory underpinning for the schemes, will have as a key objective the promotion of equality of access. I also envisage that the Bill will <Col N="476"/>provide for an independent appeals system. The timescale for the publication of this Bill is contingent on the range of issues which are the subject of the deliberations following the consultations to which I referred.</P>

These include learning support, including needs assessment and support for students with learning difficulties; assistive technology services and the provision of additional support staff such as sign-language interpreters or note takers. Students who have difficulty with public transport also receive special assistance. The supports and services are resourced through the annual allocation of funding for the institutes, and by a further &euro;2.4 million allocated through the fund for students with disabilities which assists students with a disability with their studies across all institutes of technology.</P>

	<P>I am very committed to supporting the use of ICT in higher education, as a means to enhance teaching and learning, to widen and increase participation in higher education, and to allow the institutions to develop excellence and international reputation in this area.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that ICT is becoming an increasingly important part of the process of teaching, learning and research at third level. Internationally, there have been significant advances in the use of ICT as a means to enhance academic programmes.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, the HEA in its funding allocations to the universities and other HEA funded institutions has used a small portion of the block grant to fund a strategic initiative scheme for the HEA designated third level institutions. This scheme <Col N="477"/>allows institutions to make competitive bids for projects contributing to areas of strategic or national interest. In this context, the HEA has provided up to &euro;1 million per annum for the development of technology in education over the past four years. The basic purpose is to use technology to enhance teaching and learning within the institutions, and a variety of pilot schemes have been supported in that time. The HEA is particularly anxious to use this scheme to foster collaborative proposals between institutions. This is particularly important in the case of technology in education, where investment typically needs to be large to achieve results.</P>
        <P>The programme has supported the development of integrated pedagogy and technology support centres such as the Centre for Learning Technology, TCD, the Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, NUIM, and the Learning Technology Unit, UCC. More recently the HEA approved a collaborative proposal from all seven universities for the implementation of a national digital learning repository. The basic purpose of the project is to investigate and develop a framework to enable development and sharing of digital learning resources between Irish universities. In 2005, with support from the Department of Education and Science the initiative has been joined by DIT and the institutes of technology, making it fully sectoral in scope.</P>
        <P>In September of this year, the CEO of the HEA signed a memorandum of co-operation with the director of the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK which has responsibility for e-learning developments in the UK, which is designed to foster and enhance co-operation in this area going forward.</P>
        <P>The HEA&rsquo;s e-learning strategy is based on meeting the greater diversity of student needs, increasing flexibility of provision, and enhancing the capacity for integrating study with work and leisure through work-based and home-based learning.</P>
        <P>The HEA is aware of the sizeable e-learning industry in Ireland and the opportunities this presents. It is keen to develop co-operation with IDA Ireland and the industry to make Ireland a centre for excellence in e-learning.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in April of this year I announced my commitment to a strategic innovation fund, which will be used to support and enable change in the higher education sector. I have asked the HEA to develop proposals in relation to the structuring of a call for proposals. However, I have already signalled that proposals which incorporate developments in e-learning, as a means to support teaching and learning, and access, will be welcome.</P>

Section 4 of the Act provides that the Minister for Education and Science may, by order, provide for the insertion in the Schedule of additional institutions in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function.</P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has been contacted by individuals and-or solicitors in relation to various institutions not specified in the Schedule. Following consideration of the matter and consultation with relevant public bodies, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule. A further order was made on 1 July 2005 to include another three institutions.</P>
        <P>The question of including additional institutions has now been fully considered by my Department in consultation with relevant Departments and it is not proposed to add any further institutions to the Schedule at this juncture.</P>

	<P>In 2005 I have provided recurrent funding of &euro;671 million to the university sector and &euro;475 million to the institute of technology sector. This represents an increase of approximately &euro;41 million or almost 6.5% on the 2004 provision to the university sector and more than &euro;30 million or 7.5% in 2004 comparable funding for the institute of technology sector. The additional funding being provided in 2005 marks a return to the significant upward trend in recurrent funding for the sector.</P>
        <P>The overall funding, capital and current, for the third level sector, which I secured in 2005, amounts to some &euro;1.6 billion. In 1997 when this Government took office the amount of funding provided to the third level sector was approximately &euro;850 million. The funding being provided in 2005 represents an increase of approximately &euro;750 million or 88% on the 1997 provision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The OECD review of Irish higher education highlighted the key role of the sector for our future social and economic development. This echoes the report of the Government enterprise strategy group, which states that Ireland&rsquo;s economic development, and the social dividends that flow from that, will depend to a large degree on knowledge and innovation. Supporting our higher education institutions in playing that central role is a major policy priority for the Government.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also note that in 2005 there has been an increase of approximately 36% on the 2004 provision in recurrent research funding. This is evidence of my personal, and indeed the Government&rsquo;s, commitment to research programmes, which play a vital role in developing world-class capabilities in research and innovation and give the higher education institutions the necessary resources to meet the challenges of the knowledge society in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>To discharge its responsibilities the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board&rsquo;s functions locally.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement of the board is 94 comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 11 senior educational welfare officers and 62 educational welfare officers. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Since September 2005 every county in Ireland is served by an educational welfare service.</P>
        <P>In addition to the NEWB staff there are some 490 staff in education disadvantage programmes whose work involves a school attendance element. My Department is anxious to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from these substantial personnel resources. Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for integrated working between the different services involved.</P>
        <P>I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB&rsquo;s staffing under review in the light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the board puts to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, I am determined to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools, in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school.</P>
        <P>As I have said on many occasions, I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results. Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school&rsquo;s performance.</P>
        <P>In contrast to school league tables, I believe that school inspection reports from whole school evaluations, WSE, and other inspections, when read in their entirety, can provide balanced and well-informed information on schools. The whole school evaluation process involves an examination of all the varied activities of a school &mdash; from the quality of teaching and learning to the availability of extra-curricular activities and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying, and health and safety. The inspection process also includes consultation with the school&rsquo;s board, parents and staff members, and, at second level, with the school&rsquo;s students.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>WSE reports can, therefore, provide valuable information on the educational and social opportunities provided by a school. The comments that they contain are also fully sensitive to the context in which the school operates in a way that is not possible with league tables.</P>
        <P>Given the breadth of the contents of WSE reports, the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. The type of information provided in WSE reports will help parents who need accurate and balanced information. WSE reports also contain valuable information that will be of interest to schools who may wish to learn from the experience of others.</P>
        <P>I am determined to progress this matter in a sensible and responsible way and to ensure that the views of all the education partners are considered before the publication process is finalised.</P>
        <P>During the summer, I put in place a mechanism whereby this can take place. The inspectorate of my Department has held no less than 20 meetings with interested parties over the past month, and is currently preparing draft guidelines for the publication of inspection reports which will be circulated shortly to the education partners. Responses to the draft guidelines will then be sought and a final draft of the proposals will be submitted to me in December.</P>
        <P>I intend that the publication of school inspection reports will commence from January 2006 for all inspections carried out from the start of the calendar year 2006.</P>
        <P>While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process, I would like to say the discussions held to date have been very fruitful and constructive. I know that each of the partners realises the need to address the information deficit that exists at present in terms of ensuring full public access to balanced information on schools. This is especially important to those, who like myself, are opposed to the publication of league tables and want to find a better way.</P>
        <P>I was very disappointed to hear the Deputy say over the summer that she is in favour of the publication of exam results by schools. While I appreciate that she also said she is not in favour of league tables, I believe it is naive to think that the publication of each school&rsquo;s examination results would not lead to exactly that.</P>
        <P>I am confident the considered and responsible approach that we are taking to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone.</P>

	<P>There is no facility within the education system to measure the percentage of young people leaving post-primary schools with literacy difficulties. However, the results of PISA, the programme of international student assessment, provide detailed information on the standards of reading literacy among Irish 15-year-olds.</P>
        <P>In the second cycle of PISA, which was carried out in 2003, Ireland ranked sixth in reading out of the 29 OECD countries for which results were analysed. Just three countries, Finland, Korea and Canada, had significantly higher scores than Ireland.</P>
        <P>The percentage of Irish students in the 2003 survey whose performance in reading was at or below level 1, the lowest level of proficiency, was <Col N="484"/>11%. The corresponding OECD average was 19.1%. The results of the first cycle of PISA which took place in 2000 displayed similar differences in favour of Ireland. These outcomes provide strong evidence that, with regard to reading, there are proportionately fewer low achieving students in Ireland compared to the OECD.</P>
        <P>Closer examination of the category of low achievement referred to above reveals that 2.7% of Irish students performed below level 1 compared with the OECD average of 6.7%. This indicates that the proportion of students with serious reading difficulties in Ireland is less than half that of the OECD average. The results of PISA 2000 provide similar evidence with regard to the prevalence of reading difficulties of this nature among Irish 15-year-olds.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding what I have outlined, young people with poor levels of literacy are a source of concern for my Department. To address their needs, learning support teacher services are available to all second level schools. Currently, there are 531 whole-time teacher equivalent posts for learning support. In addition, a total of 1,599 whole-time teacher posts are provided at second level to cater for students with special educational needs. All of these teachers prioritise the development of literacy skills. There are also a number of initiatives at post-primary level that have students with literacy difficulties as their target group. The junior certificate school programme focuses specifically on developing literacy skills and schools participating in the school completion programme are given considerable financial resources to provide targeted students with opportunities to improve their literacy skills in accordance with their identified needs.</P>
        <P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion that I launched last May, includes the expansion of a number of measures designed to improve literacy levels among pupils in disadvantaged communities. These measures include increased funding for the school book grant scheme which is paid to schools based on the number of needy pupils enrolled. Also included is the extension of the demonstration library project under the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, on a phased basis to additional second level schools. This will support the implementation of whole school literacy strategies in the schools concerned.</P>
        <P>The reduction of the numbers of students with literacy difficulties continues to be a key priority for my Department</P>

	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 &mdash; projected &mdash; in 2004-05.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level the pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</P>
        <P>More than 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.</P>
        <P>In relation to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

	<P>The Department has been active for several years in promoting anti-racism and interculturalism in schools. A range of actions are in place to promote anti-racism and support the participation of minority groups and Travellers in education. These include: information for schools on the integration of asylum seekers and Travellers; additional resources for schools to support the needs of students for whom English is not the mother tongue; resource packs for schools prepared by organisations such as the National Consultative Committee on Anti-Racism and Interculturalism; a video for second level schools highlighting excerpts from the &ldquo;Mono&rdquo; TV programme; materials and training for teachers through funding the work of Integrate Ireland Language Training and other bodies; and development by the NCCA of guidelines for primary and post-primary teachers on how the existing curriculum can be mediated and adapted to reflect the emergence of an expanding multicultural society. The primary guidelines have been issued to schools, and the post-primary guidelines are expected to be ready by the end of the year. Other actions include: supports provided by the Reception and Integration Agency to assist in the integration of refugees and asylum seekers into schools; and expanding provision for language and literacy tuition for adults for whom English is not the mother tongue through the VEC literacy services.</P>
        <P>A total of 595 additional teachers at primary and second level are provided to support the needs of pupils for whom English is not the mother tongue, at an annual cost of circa &euro;26.8 million. Almost 20,000 pupils from outside Ireland participate in schools at primary, second level and in PLC courses from over 148 countries around the world, almost 6,000 adult learners avail of tuition in English as a second language through the VEC adult literacy services, and 620 students take part in Back to Education initiative part-time programmes specifically targeted at disadvantaged minority groups.</P>
        <P>The new curricula at primary and post-primary levels provide ample opportunity to extend students&rsquo; awareness of the wider world and to learn about the lives and histories of people in other countries, and of their contributions to art and science. In particular, the social personal and health education programmes at primary and post-primary levels are designed to prepare students for participatory citizenship and to develop the skills of critical appraisal and decision-making based on human rights and social responsibilities. They also promote a respect for human dignity, tolerance for the values and beliefs of others, and a celebration of diversity.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.</P>
        <P>The OECD review of Irish higher education makes a series of far-reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector against the backdrop of Ireland seeking to become a leading knowledge-based society. The Government has approved the broad reform agenda outlined by the OECD and also the bringing forward of legislative proposals to transfer responsibility for management of the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority.</P>
        <P>This Bill is currently being drafted and effecting this transfer will be a key priority of my Department in the coming year. The bringing together of universities and institutes of technology under a common management structure will facilitate the development of a more strategic approach to higher education within a unified policy framework and the gradual devolution to the institutes of technology of greater academic and managerial autonomy.</P>
        <P>In April of this year, I outlined a detailed response to the OECD recommendations. It is clear that many challenges lie ahead and that our higher education institutions require support in equipping themselves to meet the demands of the knowledge society. With this in mind, I announced my intention to create a strategic innovation fund to incentivise reform and modernisation in the sector. My Department and the Higher Education Authority are in discussions about the detailed criteria which should apply to the fund and I anticipate that a first call for proposals will be issued in 2006. I understand that proposals by the HEA for a new funding model for institutions under its remit are also at an advanced stage.</P>
        <P>Progress has also been made on other issues raised in the OECD review, in particular the recommendation that research and development issues should be co-ordinated across Government. The valuable work being done by the Office of the Chief Science Adviser to the Government, along with the Cabinet Committee on Science Technology and Innovation, is facilitating the development of a united approach to policy development in this area and will ensure that national objectives can be pursued and achieved within a joined up strategy.</P>
        <P>I have signalled my intention to develop comprehensive new legislation to give effect to those OECD recommendations that will involve legislative change. I have also made it quite clear that any proposals I bring forward will take account of the views of the many stakeholders in higher education.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 89 and 104 together.</P>
        <P>The complement of psychologists in the NEPS has increased almost three-fold from 43 psychologists on establishment to 124 psychologists at present.</P>
        <P>All schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, whereby the schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in relation to all post-primary schools, the NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodations in certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service recently completed a new recruitment competition for educational psychologists for the NEPS. Candidates were asked to indicate their preferences for regions so that appointments may be made on the basis of identified priority of need on a regional basis. In all, 41 psychologists have been placed on panels.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently started the process of appointing eight psychologists from these panels. Four psychologists will be recruited for the mid-west region, covering counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, two psychologists will be recruited for the south western area of the eastern region, covering parts of Dublin West, Kildare and Wicklow and one each will be <Col N="490"/>recruited for the north-west, covering Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim, and the south-east, covering Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow.</P>
        <P>Any increase in the number of psychologists in the NEPS must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>The Residential Institutions Redress Board is an independent body established under statute in December 2002 to provide financial redress to persons who, as children, were abused while resident in industrial schools, reformatories or other institutions that were subject to State regulation or inspection.</P>
        <P>Based on the latest information from the redress board, it is estimated that the total cost of the redress scheme, including legal and administration costs, may be of the order of &euro;800 million. I should emphasise that this is very much a tentative estimate and is subject to change in the light of the ongoing administration of the scheme. The final cost of the scheme will not be known until end 2007 or early 2008 when all applications have been processed by the board.</P>
        <P>I would also like to point out that the cost of the redress scheme should be viewed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s concern to provide reasonable compensation towards the hurt and suffering experienced by victims of child abuse and the very substantial costs that would have been incurred in any event if no such scheme had been established and if cases had been processed in the normal manner through the courts.</P>

        <P>While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for Garda vetting, I am happy to outline the progress that is being made in the expansion of the service.</P>
        <P>My colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November this year.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers and others working with children.</P>
        <P>In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of requests for clearance from my Department in relation to bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with special educational needs, and to staff working in children&rsquo;s detention schools.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that, irrespective of whatever additional arrangements may be introduced in this area in the future, criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for posts.</P>
        <P>There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice and checking references, and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>

	<P>The framework for youth work in Ireland is provided by the Youth Work Act 2001 and the National Youth Work Development Plan <Col N="492"/>2003-2007. I recognise the importance of these two policy documents in the development of the youth work sector and the programmes and services.</P>
        <P>The allocation for the youth work sector in 2005 represents an 18% increase in funding over 2004 and brings financial provision for the sector to &euro;33.889 million in 2005. This is clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the youth work sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The following is the up-to-date position in relation to the priorities identified for 2005. With regard to the Youth Work Act 2001, discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the additional posts being sought by VECs to fulfil their requirements under the Act. The appointment of an assessor of youth work is an important development for youth work. Sanction for this post has been received from the Department of Finance and my Department is currently in discussion with the Public Appointments Service regarding the recruitment process. Increased funding has been made available to youth organisations and youth projects funded under the youth service grant scheme and the special projects for youth scheme. These organisations and projects have been granted an 8% increase in their financial allocations. Ten new special projects for youth have also been sanctioned together with the upgrade of 20 current single-worker special projects to two worker projects. The 8% increase also applies to youth information centres. In addition, a review of the youth information provision nationally is currently being carried out by external consultants. With regard to child protection training for the sector, additional financial support has been made available in this regard to the National Youth Council of Ireland. The promised funding review of the youth work sector is being carried out by external consultants and is nearing completion.</P>
        <P>In addition, I have also created a development fund for youth work organisations on a once-off basis to assist them in preparing themselves organisationally for the implementation of the Youth Work Act, 2001.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the new general allocation system is intended to cater for children with high incidence special needs and <Col N="493"/>those with learning support needs. The system was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</P>
        <P>Disadvantaged schools that satisfied the Department&rsquo;s criteria for additional staffing under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme &mdash; a scheme to help schools with high levels of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds &mdash; avail of a preferential pupil-teacher ratio of 80:1. Small schools &mdash; not eligible for additional staffing under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme &mdash; also avail of preferential pupil-teacher ratios under the general allocation compared to larger schools.</P>
        <P>It has always been the case that schools that were in receipt of resource teacher support in respect of pupils with special educational needs would lose teacher support, either full posts or part-time hours, when the pupils that triggered the extra support left the school.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department has introduced a new action plan for educational inclusion &mdash; DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second level education &mdash; three years to 18 years &mdash; from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P>A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage.</P>
        <P>My Department officials anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>While this action plan is in place, it is not my Department&rsquo;s intention to review individual <Col N="494"/>cases, however transitional arrangements are in place to ameliorate losses of teacher support in certain schools in the current year.</P>

	<P>In 2005, in leaving certificate mathematics, some 12% or 4,413 students scored less than grade D at ordinary level, while at foundation level, 7.7% or 428 candidates scored less than grade D.</P>
        <P>In physics, chemistry and biology at ordinary level, the proportions scoring less than grade D were 11.4%, 12% and 18.5%, respectively. While these results are broadly in line with previous years, they are a cause of concern especially as skills in maths and science are assuming increasing importance in our knowledge society.</P><Col N="495"/>
        <P>A review of mathematics in post-primary education is under way. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has published a discussion paper which highlights key concerns such as the low participation levels at higher level, the high proportions scoring less than grade D at ordinary level, reported difficulties among students in third level in grasping mathematical concepts, the dominance of didactic approaches in mathematics classrooms, over-emphasis on learning by rote, and excessive reliance on textbooks. The discussion paper features a debate on approaches to mathematics teaching and learning, including changing international trends regarding the focus on problem solving, modelling, real life contexts and &ldquo;realistic mathematics education&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The discussion paper is being distributed to schools in order to get the feedback of the wider teaching cohort. The NCCA will also engage in wider consultations with national interests, including employers on this issue. In addition, research has been commissioned by the NCCA on international trends in mathematics in upper second level education. This is being undertaken by UCC in collaboration the National Science Foundation in Washington. I expect the NCCA&rsquo;s report on this comprehensive review of mathematics early 2006.</P>
        <P>In regard to science, the revised syllabus in junior certificate science will be examined for the first time in 2006. The syllabus represents very significant changes particularly in relation to teaching methodology and assessment. It also reflects international trends towards a more investigative approach to science education. It places new emphasis on practical and project work, requiring 30 practical experiments and investigations to be presented for assessment, accounting for 35% of the total marks in the junior certificate examination. The reforms will make science more attractive, and build the foundations which will enhance performance and encourage students to continue the subject at senior cycle.</P>
        <P>In response to the NCCA&rsquo;s proposals for senior cycle reform, I have asked the NCCA to engage in a review and reconfiguration of subjects generally within the leaving certificate. Mathematics and science subjects will be given particular priority in the rollout of this process, building on the work of the mathematics review, and ensuring appropriate continuity in the science subjects from junior cycle.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to prioritising actions to bring about improvements in the standards of student achievement in mathematics and science.</P>

        <P>The amount of income to be included in respect of special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, is the Government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and, in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year.

In addition, an eligible pupil may be allowed the concession of transport, known as catchment boundary transport, to a centre other than her or his local centre, provided there is room on the bus to that centre after all locally eligible pupils have been catered for.</P>
        <P>Certain first-year pupils who reside within the Limerick city catchment area have applied for catchment boundary transport to Pallaskenry. Some have been facilitated to the extent that seats are available on the existing service and are being carried from the city catchment area to Pallaskenry.</P>
        <P>The decision in relation to this post-primary centre was made following a full assessment of all relevant factors and there is no proposal to change it.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 430 and 433 together.</P>
        <P>I have received a copy of the report mentioned by the Deputies.</P>
        <P>Since the raising of standards of Irish is a priority for my Department, matters relating to the teaching and assessment of the subject are reviewed on an ongoing basis. A range of measures have already been taken to improve the quality of learning in Irish.</P>
        <P>For primary schools, a revised curriculum in Irish was launched in 1999, placing a strong emphasis on oral Irish and was introduced fully in all schools in 2003. To support its introduction <Col N="498"/>all teachers have received in-service training which was delivered by the Primary Curriculum Support Service, PCSP, over a four year period. Teachers in schools where Irish is the medium of instruction participated in two day-long seminars and those in all other schools attended three such seminars. A total of 3,500 seminars were delivered and approximately 21,000 teachers participated. To complement this work, Regional Curriculum Support Service advisers &mdash; cuiditheoir&iacute;&mdash; who are based in local education centres are available to visit schools and advise on all aspects of the Irish curriculum. In addition, all primary teachers have engaged in school-based planning days specifically for Irish. A range of resources has been developed for use in teaching the revised Irish curriculum and prominent among these are the S&eacute;ide&aacute;n S&iacute; materials which are now available for infant and first classes.</P>
        <P>Regarding the post-primary curriculum, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently carrying out a rebalancing of the junior certificate Irish syllabi. This will involve reviewing the content of the courses along with the learning outcomes expected of students. The process which will be completed in November 2005 will identify any further aspects of these syllabi that are in need of reform. A revised literature course for leaving certificate Irish was introduced in September 2004 for first examination in 2006. This has been widely welcomed as it allows literature to be taught using modern communicative approaches that appeal to young people and it affords a high level of choice to students and teachers. For example, it includes film, for the first time, as an option for students. The revised course is accompanied by comprehensive guidelines for teachers and the development of further materials in digital format to complement these guidelines is well advanced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The inspectorate of my Department is actively involved in focused evaluations of the teaching and learning of Irish. At primary level, inspections with special emphasis on Irish have been conducted in 40 schools. At post-primary level, 10% of schools have undergone an evaluation of the teaching and learning of Irish in the junior cycle. In addition, my Department has invited the Council of Europe to carry out an analysis of the language education in Ireland. This process is currently under way and Irish is one of the main areas for consideration. Reports on each of these activities will be available in 2006 and their findings will inform further interventions to improve standards of Irish in our schools.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements are being made in regard to the provision of suitable high quality textbooks and teaching materials specifically for use in Gaeltacht and other all-Irish schools through the work of the An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta. In 2005 my Department allocated to An Chomhairle <Col N="499"/>&euro;725,000, of which an additional &euro;300,000 was specifically for the provision of textbooks and resources. I have also recently met An Chomhairle to discuss further improvements that could be made to support schools in improving the teaching and learning of Irish and to promote high quality education through the medium of Irish.</P>
        <P>In addition, Marino Institute of Education now provides courses at different levels and an enhanced range of supports for those studying for the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh Cail&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge.</P>

	<P>The Department of Health and Children has published food and nutrition guidelines for schools. In addition, many of the Health Service Executive areas have health promotion programmes in place to assist schools in this regard.</P>
        <P>My Department supports the view that good nutrition is central to a child&rsquo;s educational development. Evidence from existing studies shows that there is a significant positive relationship between improved dietary status and school performance.</P>
        <P>A knowledge of what constitutes a nutritionally balanced diet is acknowledged as being of importance for students. To support this, nutrition education is featured in the curriculum in both primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, schools are privately owned, privately managed institutions which, although funded by the State, enjoy a large degree of autonomy. It is, therefore, primarily a matter for each school to decide on the types of food that are available on the school premises. I am not aware of any impediment that would prevent schools imposing a ban on eating certain foodstuffs, although any special dietary needs of students would have to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>I know that many schools have developed healthy eating policies in co-operation with their parents association, and I would encourage others to do so.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 88 together.</P>
        <P>The number of children currently being carried on school transport is 128,300. The numbers carried in the last five years are as follows: in 2000, 131,200; in 2001, 132,700; in 2002, 130,720; in 2003, 130,100; and in 2004, 129,400.</P>
        <P>The number of concessionary pupils currently being carried on school transport is 6,257. The numbers carried in each of the last five years are as follows: in 2000, 9,127; in 2001, 8,901; in 2002, 6,845; in 2003, 7,332; and in 2004, 7,100.</P>
        <P>With regard to concessionary pupils, I should clarify that a pupil at primary level is eligible for school transport if she or he resides 3.2 kilometres or 2 miles or more from the nearest suitable primary school. At post-primary level, a pupil is eligible if she or he resides 4.8 kilometres or 3 miles or more from the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which she or he lives.</P>
        <P>In the case of primary and post-primary pupils who are ineligible for school transport on the basis of the distance requirements, transport may be offered on a concessionary fare-paying basis. Such pupils are not guaranteed school transport for every year of their schooling. Rather, the granting of such concessionary transport is dependent on the availability of additional capacity on the buses used to transport eligible students. Any such additional capacity is calculated on a year-to-year basis.</P>

	<P>In the State as a whole there are more than 20 publicly-funded higher education institutions, of which seven are universities and 14 are institutes of technology. In its review of Irish higher education published in 2004, the OECD observed that Irish third level institutions were relatively small by international standards and that this posed particular challenges in terms of achieving critical mass for academic provision, infrastructure, research and support mechanisms.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to have a third level institution in every county and to ensure that each of these could achieve this critical mass. In view of the current level of third level provision nationally, and within close proximity to Wicklow, there are no plans to develop an outreach third level education centre in Wicklow.</P>

	<P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of guidance to schools in the second level system. This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year. As a result of my decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision was put in place for 2005-06 school year. This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the free education/block grant schemes, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In addition certain schools had previously been allocated hours in response to particular needs and-or as part of the guidance enhancement initiative, such schools have been permitted to retain this higher allocation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools outside the free education or block grant schemes, 11 hours per week are allocated in respect of schools in the 350 to 499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils.</P>

Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school-going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. Towns which have an educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan.

	<P>The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand &ldquo;Myself and Others&rdquo; from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on &ldquo;Belonging and Integrating&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of <Col N="505"/>an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

	<P>My Department funds the provision of adult literacy, which is delivered, by the vocational education committees from the adult literacy and community education, ALCES, budget. This includes literacy to non-nationals.</P>
        <P>The national development plan committed &euro;93.5 million to the service in the period 2000 to 2006, with a target of reaching 113,000 clients over that period. This target will be met.</P>
        <P>Funding for adult literacy has been increased incrementally in recent years from just under &euro;1 million in 1997 to more than &euro;22 million this year. Client numbers rose in the same period from 5,000 in 1997 to more than 33,000 in 2004.</P>
        <P>The increase in funding has also enabled the introduction of special programmes targeted at groups with particular literacy needs. This includes non-nationals whose first language is not English. In 2004, 7,800 of the clients were non-national. The VECs have ensured that the level of tuition provided covers FETAC level 1 and 2 only. Asylum seekers are entitled to literacy and English language supports, other EU nationals and non-EU nationals can be offered literacy provision on the basis of need and available resources.</P>
        <P>I have no plans to provide a separate funding line as I consider it more appropriate to allow VECs the discretion within their overall budgets to allocate available resources in the light of local demand.</P>

	<P>My Department has urged school authorities to put in place book rental schemes, at both primary and post-primary level, to the greatest extent possible. To that end the school book for needy pupils grant scheme may be used by school authorities for the support of book loan-rental schemes. The 2005 allocation for the school book grant for needy pupils scheme at post-primary level is &euro;7.018 million which represents a 10.36% increase on the 2004 allocation of &euro;6.359 million.</P>
        <P>At primary level many schools operate book rental schemes and second-hand book exchanges. A total of &euro;3,859,352 has been paid by my Department in respect of the school books grant scheme in primary schools for the 2005-06 school year. This figure includes &euro;3,337,928 paid to schools operating loan-rental schemes.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, my Department also provides seed capital towards the costs of establishing book rental schemes in schools designated as disadvantaged and-or schools which participate in schemes designed to combat educational disadvantage. The intention is to provide some specific financial support for the introduction or expansion of book loan-rental schemes in individual schools on an annual basis, for a maximum of six years or five years in the case of five-year cycle schools. It is envisaged that schools which receive seed capital will be in a position to establish sustainable book loan-rental schemes which, after the initial special assistance, will operate on a self-financing basis where ongoing costs will be met by fee income, which can be subsidised in the case of needy pupils from the general book grant scheme allocation. Funding in respect of seed capital amounted to &euro;221,240 in 2004.</P>
        <P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, which I launched last May, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed.</P>
        <P>The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon, a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. In the new action plan, additional funding will be made available under the school books for needy pupils grant scheme aimed primarily at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan-rental schemes.</P>

        <QRef>[27663/05]</QRef>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Early education in Ireland covers the period from birth to six years. At present almost all five year olds and half of four year olds attend junior infant and senior infant classes in primary schools. Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early childhood education focuses on pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, Traveller children and those with special needs. The bulk of pre-school places in the country are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years currently providing some 26,000 child care places.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The early start programme, referred to by the Deputy, is a pre-school intervention programme targeted at three to four year old children in areas of social disadvantage. With this programme, young children can experience an educational programme to enhance their overall development, help prevent school failure and help offset the effects of social disadvantage. The early start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
        <P>Targeted early childhood education provision will be a key element of the new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched in May of this year. The plan&rsquo;s objective is to concentrate early education actions on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend urban-town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. On a phased basis, the 150 urban-town primary school communities serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage will be provided with access to early education for children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend these primary schools. The action plan will be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years and will involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach will be to work in partnership with other Departments and agencies <Col N="508"/>to complement and add value to existing child care programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner.</P>
        <P>Co-ordination between education and care is essential in the further development of early childhood services in the country.</P>
        <P>The issue of co-ordination of services is being tackled through the high level working group being chaired by the National Children&rsquo;s Office. This group has been asked to provide the Government with a range of policy options which: make the link between education and care and the benefits to be gained by individual children as well as by communities and society in general; increase the supply of appropriate early childhood education and care settings by developing capacity in the system; include measures which make services more affordable; and ensure quality is a design feature in the child care system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>The funding provided by my Department for community education under the adult literacy and community education budget, amounts to nearly &euro;9 million in 2005. This is separate to the back to education initiative, 10% of which is reserved for the non-formal community education field.</P>
        <P>Community education is available to all. It refers to education and learning, generally out<Col N="509"/>side the formal education sector, with the aims of enhancing learning, empowerment and contributing to civic society. It is firmly community-based, with local groups taking responsibility for, and playing a key role in organising courses, deciding on programme-content and recruiting tutors.</P>
        <P>The grants provided by the Department to the VECs are, first, to enable disadvantaged adults to avail of community education at minimal or no cost and, second, for adult literacy classes for which there is no charge. Others who do not come within the disadvantaged category, or who attend leisure or hobby type courses, have to pay the economic fee.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for VECs to finance their adult education programmes from within their approved budgets, and they have discretion in setting the fees charged to those clients who have the means to pay. The fees charged reflect the economic cost of the courses.</P>

	<P>The first bundle of five post-primary PPP schools were delivered up to eight weeks ahead of schedule and within the price agreed. There was no cost overrun.</P>
        <P>One of the fundamental elements of PPPs is the incorporation of life cycle planning in the design, construction and costing of the project. My Department has, as a result of its PPP experience, included this element of design in traditionally procured schools, with emphasis on the durability of design and materials. While it is anticipated that this will lead to an increase in the capital cost of school projects, it will lead to lower maintenance costs and greater longevity of schools in the future, thus providing value for money over a longer term.</P>

	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes all teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1 &mdash; projected &mdash; in 2004-05 .</P>
        <P>At post primary level the pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</P>
        <P>More than 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.</P>
        <P>In relation to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One in five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.</P>
        <P>In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

	<P>The report of a working group to examine potential problems caused by the weight of schoolbags, which was presented in July 1998, acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level. One of the main recommendations of the report related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
        <P>In this regard, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools. A further circular was issued this year, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted in order to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each individual school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
        <P>My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools. At second level, actions taken by some schools consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P>
        <P>Where complaints are received by my Department in relation to this problem in particular schools, parents are asked to bring the matter to <Col N="512"/>the attention of the school in question and direct the attention of the school authority to the need to address the problem by implementing those recommendations contained in the report best suited to the particular school&rsquo;s individual needs.</P>
        <P>It is considered that the issue of the most recent circular on the weight of schoolbags will serve to once again raise awareness of the problem and lead to local solutions being implemented where necessary.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 93 together.</P>
        <P>There is no facility within the education system to measure the percentage of young people leaving post-primary schools with literacy difficulties. <Col N="514"/>However, the results of PISA, the programme of international student assessment, provide detailed information on the standards of reading literacy among Irish 15-year-olds.</P>
        <P>In the second cycle of PISA, which was carried out in 2003, Ireland ranked sixth in reading out of the 29 OECD countries for which results were analysed. Only three countries, Finland, Korea and Canada, had significantly higher scores than Ireland.</P>
        <P>The percentage of Irish students in the 2003 survey whose performance in reading was at or below level 1, the lowest level of proficiency, was 11%. The corresponding OECD average was 19.1%. The results of the first cycle of PISA which took place in 2000 displayed similar differences in favour of Ireland. These outcomes provide strong evidence that, with regard to reading, there are proportionately fewer low achieving students in Ireland compared to the OECD.</P><Col N="515"/>
        <P>Closer examination of the category of low achievement referred to above reveals that 2.7% of Irish students performed below level 1 compared with the OECD average of 6.7%. This indicates that the proportion of students with serious reading difficulties in Ireland is less than half that of the OECD average. The results of PISA 2000 provide similar evidence with regard to the prevalence of reading difficulties of this nature among Irish 15-year-olds.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding what I have outlined, young people with poor levels of literacy are a source of concern for my Department. To address their needs, learning support teacher services are available to all second level schools. Currently, there are 531 whole-time teacher equivalent posts for learning support. In addition, a total of 1,599 whole-time teacher posts are provided at second level to cater for students with special educational needs. All of these teachers prioritise the development of literacy skills. There are also a number of initiatives at post-primary level that have students with literacy difficulties as their target group. The junior certificate school programme focuses specifically on developing literacy skills and schools participating in the school completion programme are given considerable financial resources to provide targeted students with opportunities to improve their literacy skills in accordance with their identified needs.</P>
        <P>DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion that I launched last May, includes the expansion of a number of measures designed to improve literacy levels among pupils in disadvantaged communities. These measures include increased funding for the school book grant scheme which is paid to schools based on the number of needy pupils enrolled. Also included is the extension of the demonstration library project under the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, on a phased basis to additional second level schools. This will support the implementation of whole school literacy strategies in the schools concerned.</P>
        <P>The reduction of the numbers of students with literacy difficulties continues to be a key priority for my Department</P>

	<P>I am aware of the international league <Col N="516"/>table of universities compiled by Shangai Jiva Tong University. I understand this table represents a measurement based on items such as the number of Nobel prize winners, cited researchers and size of institution.</P>
        <P>While it is useful to benchmark the performance of Irish higher education institutions with international institutions, it is important to note the inherent difficulty in such exercises. The compilers of the Shangai index acknowledge that the quality of universities &ldquo;cannot be precisely measured by mere numbers&rdquo;, and as such no ranking is absolutely objective.</P>
        <P>However, the Shangai index serves to remind us of the very competitive and global environment in which our higher education institutions operate, and we must ensure that they are equipped to meet this challenge. The 2004 OECD review identified a range of proposals for reform, the broad thrust of which has been accepted by the Government. I am confident major policy initiatives I have already initiated as part of the response to the OECD report, such as the transfer of the institutes of technology to the Higher Education Authority and the creation of a strategic innovation fund to facilitate reform and modernisation in the sector, will greatly improve the capacity of our higher education institutions to compete with other institutions in this global environment.</P>

	<P>Section 27(2) of the Education Act 1998 provides that procedures established and maintained by schools under section 27(1), for the purposes of informing students of the activities of the school, shall facilitate the involvement of students in the operation of the school in association with their parents and teachers. The Education Act also provides that post-primary schools should encourage and facilitate the establishment of student councils. An effective school council can be a very good way for students to give feedback on their school experiences.</P>
        <P>Student councils are established in the majority of post-primary schools. I believe very strongly that one cannot merely teach students about rights and responsibilities in the CSPE class, one must give them responsibilities in the place where they spend much of their day. I have stressed to teachers&rsquo; groups the need to not only ensure that each school has a student council but that <Col N="517"/>councils are given a meaningful role in school decision-making.</P>

	<P>Estimates of the incidence of dyslexia usually range from 1% to 4%, depending on the definition adopted.</P>
        <P>Precise information on the number of primary school children with dyslexia is not currently available. I wish to advise the Deputy that the provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system of resource teaching last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.</P>
        <P>There are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs, including dyslexia.</P>
        <P>Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1.</P>
        <P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports. The council has a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. The council has a local area presence through a network of over 70 special educational needs organisers, SENOs.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Oireachtas has approved the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. This act sets out the rights and entitlements of persons with special educational needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and provides the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local SENO directly for this support.</P>
        <P>Training is available through the 21 teacher education centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assistive technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.</P><Col N="519"/>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department established the Special Education Support Service, SESS, to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The SESS, which is hosted in Cork Education Centre, provides a nationwide service to teachers and special needs assistants. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas &mdash; autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the education centre network.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, and the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

The maximum level of qualifying fee for tax relief purposes in respect of the academic year 2005-06 is &euro;5,000.

	<P>Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, parents, agencies that work with children and society generally and I can assure the Deputy that the Government is determined <Col N="520"/>to do all that we can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November this year.</P>
        <P>The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers and others working with children.</P>
        <P>In the education sector, vetting is currently available in respect of requests for clearance from my Department in relation to bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with special educational needs, and to staff working in children&rsquo;s detention schools.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out that, irrespective of whatever additional arrangements may be introduced in this area in the future, criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for posts.</P>
        <P>There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example, good interviewing practice and checking references, and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In relation to a register of persons unsafe to work with children, the Deputy will be aware that the working group on Garda vetting included in its report a recommendation that my Department and the Department of Health and Children could give consideration to the development of non-Garda, employment-related vetting registers to provide information on those previously dismissed, suspended, moved or made redundant from posts for harming children or vulnerable adults in the health and education sectors. An implementation group has been established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure the delivery of the working group&rsquo;s recommendations and discussions between my Department and the Department of Health and Children are ongoing in that context. Although considerable preparatory work examining the issues relating to a pre-employment consultancy service, similar to that in Northern Ireland, has been undertaken by my Department, these discussions remain at an early stage. In addition, my Department will be convening meetings with the education partners in order to explore all the issues involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The teaching council also has a role here. Once it is formally established, the council will provide <Col N="521"/>the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to regulate itself and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and, if necessary, removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.</P>

	<P>The Department of Education and Science originally planned to provide an eight classroom school in Wicklow town for the gaelscoil in question. A site to accommodate this was subsequently purchased and the building project was allowed to progress into architectural planning. However, due to changing demographics, enrolments in the school increased to a level where it is now considered that a 16 classroom school is warranted. The existing site cannot be developed to cater for this need. The Department of Education and Science is, therefore, actively seeking an alternative site.</P>
        <P>When this has been acquired, progress on the project will be considered in the school building and modernisation programme. In the meantime, high quality temporary accommodation has been made available to improve conditions at the school. A review of the overall educational needs at both primary and post-primary level in Wicklow town is being carried out and use of the existing site will be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>The major focus for the Department of Education and Science is the roll-out of broadband connectivity to all recognised schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three year &euro;18 million joint Government &mdash; IBEC-TIF, Telecommunications and Internet Federation Fund to fund local connectivity at school level. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls and content filtering. A broadband support service is being provided by the National Centre for Technology in Education to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.</P>
        <P>The roll-out process is under way and is expected to be completed by March 2006. The overall costs of the schools broadband access programme, comprising the local connectivity at school level, the schools national broadband network and the support service, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the next three years are estimated at some &euro;30 million. The provision of always-on high speed Internet access for recognised schools presents a major development in the ICT in schools initiative to integrate technology into teaching and learning in our schools and to ensure that the ICT skills of our young people are developed to their full potential.</P>
        <P>The roll-out of broadband connectivity builds on the recent investment of some &euro;20 million by <Col N="523"/>the Department of Education and Science in providing grants to schools for the development of computer networking facilities. The development of internal networking facilities in schools is critical to supporting schools&rsquo; full exploitation of the potential offered by broadband connectivity. There has been significant progress in the development of ICT infrastructure in schools, in enhancing teachers skills and pedagogical practice and in the development of curriculum and learning resources, since the introduction of the ICT in schools initiative in 1998. The National Centre for Technology in Education is undertaking a further census of ICT infrastructure and the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s inspectorate is embarking on an evaluation of the impact of ICT in teaching and learning in schools. These developments will inform future policy directions for the ICT in schools initiative.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ensuring the protection, health and welfare of children is a key concern for the Government, parentsand agencies that work with children and society generally. The Government is determined to do all that it can to keep our children and vulnerable adults safe. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a doubling of the number of staff employed in the unit to ensure that they can handle a greater volume of requests from employers. The unit will commence the augmentation of its existing vetting arrangements upon decentralisation targeted for mid-November 2005. The provision of additional staff resources will enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults. This will include teachers, caretakers and others working with children.</P>
        <?oasys _ic0-?><P>In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of requests for clearance from the Department of Education and Science for bus escorts and special needs assistants provided to children with special educational needs, and to staff working in children&rsquo;s detention schools. Irrespective of whatever additional arrangements may be introduced in this area in the future, criminal record checks, while being capable in appropriate circumstances of making a significant <Col N="524"/>contribution to ensuring that unsuitable persons do not secure positions of trust, are not the sole answer to ensuring applicants&rsquo; suitability for posts. There will continue to be a particular onus of care on employers to maintain good employment practice both during the recruitment stage, for example good interviewing practice, checking of references, and in ensuring adequate supervision arrangements post-recruitment.</P>
        <P>The working group on Garda vetting has recommended the Protection of Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998 be amended so as to offer protection for persons reporting the abuse of vulnerable adults, such as those with certain mental and physical disabilities, and not just the abuse of children. It was also recommended that the Sex Offenders Act 2001 should be amended to require a convicted sex offender to inform a prospective employer of his or her conviction when applying for a position involving unsupervised access to the physically disabled and not just children or the mentally impaired. These proposals are being considered within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

	<P>The introduction of standardised testing on a systematic basis has great potential to improve the quality of teaching and learning in schools. I welcome the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, that all pupils should take standardised tests in literacy and numeracy at the end of first class or the beginning of second class, and at the end of fourth class or the beginning of fifth class.</P>
        <P>Important groundwork remains to be done before an implementation date can be set. I have asked the NCCA to continue its development work in the production of guidelines and exemplars for teachers for assessment, national reporting procedures, and a national policy on the transfer of information to post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science is exploring potential implementation models, in advance of entering into discussions with the education partners in the matter. My intention is that we will proceed carefully to ensure the recommendations proposed by the NCCA are implemented in a way has positive benefits for children, parents, teachers and the system as a whole. This is one of a range of developments <Col N="525"/>which need to take place to enhance the role of assessment in the overall process of teaching and learning.</P>

	<P>Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and were determined following consultation with local educational interests. For planning purposes the country was divided into geographic districts each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was and continues to be that these defined districts facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. While I do not believe a general countrywide review of catchment boundaries is necessary, reviews of specific catchment boundaries may be carried out where appropriate. Several reviews have been carried out over the years where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, where a &ldquo;sole provider&rdquo; school closes due to declining enrolment.</P>
        <P>The area development planning initiative, involving an extensive consultative process carried out by the Commission on School Accommodation, will also inform future revisions to catchment areas. An area development plan takes account of demographic changes and projects future enrolments for existing schools and new schools if required. Catchment boundary changes will be made where the implementation of the recommendations in an area development plan requires such adjustments. Catchment boundaries have provided and continue to provide a very useful tool in facilitating the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the operation of the national school transport service.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures available in the Department of Education and Science refer to the 2004-05 school year, and indicate that, of the 1,357 teachers appointed for the first time as permanent or temporary qualified teachers at primary level, 144 were male. The relatively low levels of men in the primary teaching force, a feature common to all OECD countries, is an issue that is of concern to me. It is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>One way to address this issue is to undertake a promotional campaign to encourage more boys into teaching. Plans for this campaign are being considered in the Department of Education and Science.</P>

	<P>Following allegations of financial impropriety at Marino Institute of Education, I asked the accountancy firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, to examine the use of moneys paid by the Department of Education and Science to the institute. The main findings of the review, published in early August, revealed there has been no misuse of the public moneys paid by the Department of Education and Science to the institute.</P>
        <P>Although the Department of Education and Science did not have any concerns regarding the use of funding provided for the purpose of training teachers, it was, nevertheless, important in view of the level of public and media interest in this matter, to demonstrate clearly that public funding was properly applied for teacher training. I am happy the findings of the examination confirm this position. The review covered the beginning of the academic year 2001-02 to the date it was commissioned, 9 May 2005. This was the period that related to the unproven allegations of financial irregularity. I am assured by PricewaterhouseCoopers the years leading up to 2001-02, although not covered directly in the terms of reference for the review, were considered by them in compiling its report and informed the findings of the review.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science cannot and should not give open-ended terms of reference. The question of materiality and costs <Col N="527"/>must also be considered when commissioning such reviews and setting terms of reference. These factors, together with the nature of the allegations being made about funding provided to the institute, informed the decision regarding the period to be covered in the review.</P>

	<P>Capital funding is being provided under the school building and modernisation programme 2005-2009 for the refurbishment of science laboratories undertaken as part of an overall refurbishment programme of second level schools, for the upgrading of science facilities exclusively or by provision of new facilities in the case of newly built or extended schools. Additionally, I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the sciences.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science spent in excess of &euro;13 million in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised junior science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. Funding is also available this year to schools that have yet to apply for the basic grant of &euro;3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum. Schools have also received funding under the summer works scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories. Funding will be made available under the 2006 summer works scheme for science and technology upgrades.</P>
        <P>In the application for funding, post-primary schools have been asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration can be given to approving these projects for 2006. The closing date for receipt of applications is 14 October 2005.</P>
        <P>Following the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science, the then Minister for Education and Science established a task force on the physical sciences to address the declining uptake of the physical sciences. The task force reported in March 2002. The report identified six action areas, including planning and <Col N="528"/>resources; equity, teaching and learning; curriculum and assessment; promotion of science; transition and integration into third level. The Department of Education and Science continues to progress the recommendations of the task force as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and industry.</P>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in a range of areas pertaining to the Department of Education and Science. For example, a new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of &euro;1,000 per school plus &euro;10 per pupil; a revised syllabi in junior certificate science and in leaving certificate physics, chemistry and biology have been introduced. Work on the revision of the two remaining leaving certificate subjects, agricultural science and physics and chemistry combined is well advanced. The introduction of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers. A review of grading of subjects in the leaving certificate and initial reports on teacher training have been undertaken. A review of mathematics at post-primary level is being undertaken by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. Investment in the programme of research in third level institutes is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development. Between this programme and the various grants to the research councils, and other sources, an estimated &euro;101.5 million will be invested in third level institutions in 2005.</P>
        <P>Under the discover science and engineering programme, operated under the aegis of Forf&aacute;s with the collaboration of the education sector, was launched in October 2003 to bring together existing science awareness activities in a unified strategy. I made a provision of &euro;750,000 towards the cost of the BA Festival of Science, one of the world&rsquo;s leading science events, hosted by Trinity College Dublin this year.</P>

	<P>The recent OECD report examines changes in expenditure since the mid-1990s. It shows that public expenditure on education, here, has increased substantially between 1995 and 2002 at all levels even when allowing for inflation. For example the same OECD report shows that total spending increased by 56% here compared to 28% on average across the OECD. Between 1997 and 2005, the overall budget for education has more than doubled, from &euro;3.2 billion in 1997, to &euro;7.1 billion in 2005. At the same time, there was a dramatic and unprecedented increase in national output, especially as measured by GDP. As repatriated corporate profits of foreign multi-nationals accounts for a significant proportion of GDP, it is not a good measure of the amount of money available to the Government for investment in public services. However, public expenditure on education has increased substantially in absolute terms in recent years.</P>

	<P>Boards of management are recognised under section 14 of the Education Act 1998. They also operate in accordance with the constitution of boards and rules of procedure, issued by the Department of Education and Science to assist boards in the effective governance of schools.</P>
        <P>In 2002-03, the Department reviewed the process whereby it supported a range of in-service activities, including board of management training, for schools at primary and post-primary levels. Previously, limited financial support was provided to a range of course providers-organisers for elective programmes of in-service, to the extent that resources permitted and having regard to other commitments and priorities such as curricular reform and special needs. However, this approach was regarded as too fragmented.</P>
        <P>To rationalise the process and to make better use of available resources, groups and bodies were advised to contact their local education centre whose role, among other things, is to provide local in-service and support and to provide advice and assistance to schools and their personnel in these matters.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science funds a national network of 21 full-time and nine part-time education centres to deliver in-service support for schools and their personnel. The education centres provide board of management training courses to schools within their catchment area, usually in conjunction with other bodies and groups. To ensure consistency of provision, the Department of Education and Science liaises with appropriate bodies at central level. The teacher education section of the Department of Education and Science established a new mechanism for providing support to such bodies in 2005 on a pilot basis. This mechanism enables school management bodies to apply for direct support in addition to the existing support provided by the education centre network. This will remain in place pending a review of the process. The teacher education section is prepared to consider proposals and to provide support to management bodies following consultation and consideration of submissions.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 406 and 448 together.</P>
        <P>The level of funding that the Department of Education and Science provides to Educate Together as a school management body is on a par with that provided to Foras Patr&uacute;nachta na Gaelscoileanna, the Church of Ireland Board of Education, the Islamic Board of Education and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. However, following discussions with Educate Together, the Department of Education and Science has provided additional funding to Educate Together in 2005 to meet the immediate issues of concern to that body. The matter of the future funding to be provided to the primary management bodies, including Educate Together, in 2006 will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has supported the establishment of many new Educate Together schools in recent years. Of the 24 new schools granted provisional recognition in the past three years, 12 of them are under Educate Together patronage, 11 of which are open. The Department of Education and Science has made several changes in recent years which have made the provision of accommodation for new schools much easier. One of these changes, strongly welcomed by Educate Together, was the abolition of the local contribution to the building costs for State-owned school buildings, which had <Col N="533"/>cost up to &euro;63,500 per school. Other innovations include the development of the design and build model to provide permanent accommodation much faster, such as in the case of the new Educate Together school in Griffeen Valley, Lucan, which was designed and built in under 13 months.</P>

        <Quest>if she will introduce mainstream anti-bullying programmes into schools in view of the success of pilot programmes in certain areas and the growing concern at the prevalence of bullying in schools here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>The social, personal and health education programme and the school development planning initiative are two important mainstream national programmes of support for schools. Both play a central role in assisting schools in a co-ordinated and cohesive manner to deal with the problem of bullying. In recent years, several pilot programmes have also addressed this issue. Pilot programmes are utilised as a means of informing possible new initiatives or how best existing provision may be improved upon. The function of pilot programmes is to test and evaluate different ideas and approaches to aid and enhance existing provision. Pilot programmes, when completed, are evaluated for programme content, effectiveness and appropriateness and the recommendations and findings are considered in developing existing programmes and structures which are designed to meet the needs of schools at local level.</P>
        <P>The issue of bullying in schools and the Department of Education and Science has in place a multifaceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools on anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. It is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The social, personal and health education curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying.</P>
        <P>In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the social, personal and health education curriculum in the strand, Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the social, personal and health education curriculum at junior cycle, in the module, Belonging and Integrating. The Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying <Col N="534"/>behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</P>
        <P>Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures.</P>

	<P>The report of the primary education committee contains several recommendations aimed at increasing the number of males entering primary teaching. The report is being considered by the relevant officials in the Department of Education and Science. The relatively low levels of men in the primary teaching force, a feature common to all OECD countries, is an issue that is of concern to me. It is important to attract more men into teaching for a number of reasons, not least of which is the positive role models that teachers provide in children&rsquo;s lives and the desirability of having both male and female role models in our schools.</P>
        <P>The primary education committee was established to examine a range of issues on males entering primary teaching, and to make recommendations on short-term and long-term strategies to increase the numbers in this regard. The report draws on the professional insight of the key experts in this area as well as an examination of several relevant research studies. The report&rsquo;s findings will be of significant benefit in assisting the development of future policy in this important area. One key recommendation in the committee&rsquo;s report is that a co-ordinated promotion campaign, which would encourage boys as well as girls to enter primary teaching, should be undertaken. Officials in the Department of Education and Science will take action to determine how such a promotion campaign can be run to maximum effect. All other recommendations <Col N="536"/>contained in the report are receiving consideration.</P>

	<P>A recent report by the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, submitted to the Department of Education and Science indicates in the academic year 2004-05 students with a disability formed 2.7% &mdash; 1,366 &mdash; of full-time undergraduates in the sector. This figure compares with a participation rate of 1.5% for the institutes in the last AHEAD survey in 1998. It also exceeds the 2006 target for third level entrants with a disability, set by the action group on access 2001, which was 1.8%. This growth in participation reflects that improved systems of support, in particular through the fund for students with a disability, are encouraging and supporting students to access and participate in higher education in greater numbers than ever previously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no requirement for second level schools to produce such a report. However, the Education Act 1998 requires the board of management of a school to establish procedures for informing the parents of students in the school of matters relating to the operation and performance of the school. Such procedures may include the publication of a report on the operation and performance of the school in any school year. The methods by which such information is provided remains a matter for the board of management.</P>
        <P>For example, it is common practice in many schools that an annual report is prepared for the final meeting of the board of management each year. This normally makes reference to how successfully policies were implemented during the year, highlights particular achievements and states priorities for the next school year. Some schools may send a synopsis of this report to <Col N="537"/>parents. The practice of reporting in the above manner to boards of management is encouraged by some of the trustee bodies. Reports are normally sent to the trustee body. There is also a growing trend whereby principals give a report on the activities of the school in the previous school year, as well as indicating planned activities for the coming school year, to the annual general meeting of the parents&rsquo; association at the beginning of a new school year. Many schools send a newsletter to parents at intervals during the year or at the end of the school year. Normally, information is included on planned and achieved school activities.</P>
        <P>I am determined to provide more information, for parents in particular, about our schools, in a way that ensures a fair and comprehensive picture of all the different activities in a school. I am strongly opposed to the publication of crude league tables based solely on examination or test results. Such tables provide an unbalanced and grossly limited indication of a school&rsquo;s performance. In contrast to school league tables, school inspection reports from whole school evaluations and other inspections, when read in their entirety, can provide balanced and well-informed information on schools.</P>
        <P>The whole school evaluation process involves an examination of all the varied activities of a school from the quality of teaching and learning to the availability of extra-curricular activities and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying, and health and safety. The inspection process also includes consultation with the school&rsquo;s board, parents and staff members, and, at second level, with the school&rsquo;s students. Whole school evaluation reports can provide valuable information on the educational and social opportunities provided by a school. The comments that they contain are also fully sensitive to the context in which the school operates in a way which is not possible with league tables. Given the breadth of the contents of such reports, the publication of these and other school inspection reports could go a significant way to addressing the real needs of parents, students, teachers and others for better information on schools. The type of information provided in whole school evaluation reports will help parents who need accurate and balanced information. Whole school evaluation reports also contain valuable information that will be of interest to schools who may wish to learn from the experience of others.</P>
        <P>I am determined to progress this matter in a sensible and responsible way and to ensure the views of all the education partners are considered before the publication process is finalised. During the summer, a mechanism was put in place whereby this can take place. The inspectorate of the Department of Education and Science has held 20 meetings with interested parties over the <Col N="538"/>past month, and is preparing draft guidelines for the publication of inspection reports which will be circulated shortly to the education partners. Responses to the draft guidelines will then be sought and a final draft of the proposals will be submitted to me in December.</P>
        <P>The publication of school inspection reports will commence from January 2006 for all inspections carried out from the start of the calendar year 2006. While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process, the discussions held to date have been fruitful and constructive. Each of the partners realises the need to address the information deficit that exists in ensuring full public access to balanced information on schools. This is especially important to those, who like myself, are opposed to the publication of league tables and want to find a better way. The considered and responsible approach to the publication of inspection reports will lead to much greater availability of information on schools without inadvertently pitting schools serving entirely different communities against each other in crude comparisons of academic performance alone. Whether intended or not, academic league tables would be a likely consequence of publishing exam results in an annual report for each school.</P>

        <P FLI="0">An updated industrial earnings series was introduced in 2000 with retrospective annual data back to 1996. The data in the table show annual earnings according to the former series from 1960 up to and including 1996 and according to the new series for 1996 and 2000. Preliminary data for 2005 quarter 2 have also been included. A revised weighting system in the new series has given rise to minor differences between the updated and former series for the retrospective periods. In the former series, the weights for the lowest size category, ten to 49 persons engaged, also reflected the employment of units with fewer than ten persons engaged. The new series explicitly covers units with ten or more persons engaged.</P>

	<P>In October 2004, the Belorussian Government suspended all inter-country adoption from Belarus pending a full review of the adoption laws, procedures and practices that apply in inter-country adoption cases. A delegation from the adoption board met the Belorussian authorities on 8 September 2005, the primary purpose of which was to address the issue of the outstanding 18 cases which have been with the Belorussian authorities since before the closure. The Irish delegation also indicated it wanted to discuss future humanitarian co-operation on adoption. The Belorussian authorities expressed their satisfaction that a delegation had travelled to Belarus. This was the first such delegation to be received in Belarus since the closure. While the Belorussian adoption authorities declined to discuss individual cases, they indicated that if and when an agreement is reached and adoptions re-commence, priority would be given to applicants who have a named child.</P>
        <P>The Belorussian authorities presented a draft protocol to the Irish delegation which has been translated and is with the Office of the Attorney General for its consideration. Negotiations on this protocol will commence as soon as possible. However, it is not possible to put a timeframe on <Col N="542"/>these negotiations or to predict their outcome at this point in the process.</P>

	<P> The Deputy&rsquo;s question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. This includes responsibility for considering new capital proposals or progressing those in the health capital programme. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children is requesting the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive has made provision to progress this development within the health capital investment framework, 2005 to 2009. The project has been sanctioned up to tender stage, which includes completion of detailed design documentation. It was recently decided to fast-track the completion of the fit-out of the ward accommodation in the shelled-out area. This decision was taken to provide additional capacity more quickly than if the full project proceeded as a single construction contract. The design team is preparing detailed drawings with the intention of going to tender in March 2006. A prior indicative notice is to be lodged in the Official Journal of the European Union by mid-October. Staff on site are to be fully consulted as part of the detailed design process. Planning permission is to be sought by the beginning of November, and the target completion date for the fit-out of the shelled area is early 2007. On completion, the fit-out of the shelled accommodation is intended to provide an additional 43 beds, mainly medical and surgical beds.</P>
        <P>The design work on the second stage of the project will continue in parallel with the fit-out and equipping of the shelled accommodation project. The second stage will include the provision of the following new facilities including a pathology department, an operating department, a medicine for the elderly-rehabilitation unit, an acute psychiatric unit, a child and adolescent psychiatric unit, an occupational therapy department, administrative accommodation, staff accommodation, education facilities, catering facilities and a new entrance concourse.</P>
        <P>The completion of the second stage of the project is intended to provide a further 16 additional <Col N="543"/>beds, mainly for day cases, as well as accommodating the transfer of 50 rehabilitation and acute psychiatric beds from facilities located outside the hospital. In all, there will be 109 additional beds on the hospital campus following the completion of the overall development. It has been estimated by the Health Service Executive that additional revenue funding of the order of &euro;10 million, excluding inflation, will be required on an annual basis to run the shelled-out area when it is fully fitted-out. This estimate reflects a combination of the additional pay and non-pay costs required. Given the significant level of additional annual revenue costs associated with the project, I recently decided that an independent review of the estimate is necessary to ensure that the estimate and staff profile represent best value for money. This review is due to be completed prior to the finalisation of the tender documentation, and it is not anticipated that it will delay the project.</P>

	<P>In the budget for 2000, the Minister for Finance introduced an increase in the excise duty of just over 63 cent or 50p on a packet of 20 cigarettes, raising &euro;167.605 million or £132 million for the Exchequer in a full year. The Appropriation Act 1999 stated that &ldquo;such sum as may be determined by the Minister for Finance, not exceeding £132 million, shall be paid to the Minister for Health and Children...for services and purposes connected with the performance by the second-mentioned Minister of his or her functions, out of moneys collected by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the duty of excise imposed by section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duty on Tobacco Products) Act, 1977&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The figure of &euro;167.605 million contained in the Revised Estimates Volume 2005 in respect of certain excise duties on tobacco products is appropriated in aid of the Vote for the Department of Health and Children and allows gross total spending of &euro;401.413 million for my Department. Thus, the net requirement of my Department from the Exchequer is reduced to &euro;233.418 million. The collection of these excise duties is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

	<P>The national hygiene audit, arranged by the Health Service Executive and the national hospitals office was completed on schedule at the end of August. This involved visits to each of the 54 acute hospitals in the country by a team of independent consultants. The purpose of the audit was to assess the standards of environmental hygiene and cleanliness in each hospital and to provide baseline information.</P>
        <P>The final report from the audit is expected to be presented to the director of the national hospitals office this month. This will form the basis for the changes that are required in both <Col N="546"/>work environments and work practices to meet the highest possible standards of cleanliness in hospital settings.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive will also publish national infection control standards and national cleaning standards, a consistent and robust set of hygiene standards for hospitals. Where previously standards may have depended on the approach of a particular hospital or health board, the HSE can now ensure every hospital will share and meet the same high standards of cleanliness and infection control.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 128 to 131, inclusive, and 152 together.</P>
        <P>Prior to the establishment on 1 January 2005 of the Health Service Executive with its own Vote, health services were delivered by the individual health boards which were funded by grants from the Vote of my Department. The first contracts for the PPARS system were signed by five of the former boards and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in 1998. The health boards executive was established in 2002 to facilitate joint working by health boards and took over the lead role for the project, but funding continued to be paid to the individual health boards.</P>
        <P>By the end of 2004 the total amount of funding provided for the project by my Department amounted to some &euro;110 million and the HSE indicated that a further &euro;55 million or so would be required in 2005. The HSE decided on 6 October that any further development of the project should be put on hold and that an executive group will now establish the long-term value of <Col N="549"/>PPARS in the context of the HSE&rsquo;s national unified structure.</P>
        <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s Office is carrying out a value for money examination of the project. This has been a matter of public record for some time. The examination will, I expect, address issues such as the development, governance and management of the project. My Department is, in that context, reviewing its own role in the project.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Department of Finance had previously raised concerns about the costs of the project, specifically in relation to the consultancy and staffing costs. Last July, the Secretary General of my Department asked the HSE to undertake an urgent review of the project and is awaiting a formal report from the HSE following the meeting of its board last Thursday.</P>
        <P>PPARS was funded each year from within the annual estimates, both current and capital. Successive Ministers would have been involved in agreeing the overall capital requirement for ICT, which would have also been examined by the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and approved by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the continuing significant increase in general practitioner fees; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that some general practitioners in Dublin recently increased their fees from &euro;40 to &euro;50; her plans to impose limits on the amounts that general practitioners may charge for consultations or home visits in view of the financial strain that these fees may put on low income families who do not have a medical card; if her Department retains any statistics on the fees charged by general practitioners; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Consultation fees charged to private patients by general practitioners are a matter of private contract between the two parties, the doctor as the service provider and the patient as the user. I have no role in the setting of these fees. However, I will ask my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to consider whether the Competition Authority or the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs may have any role in relation to the level of fees charged for GP services.</P>
        <P>The recent agreement reached between the parties on the labour relations commission&rsquo;s recommendation of June 2005 will allow the Health Service Executive to proceed with the introduction of GP visit cards which will enable 200,000 people to have free access to general practitioner services under the general medical <Col N="550"/>services scheme. Applications for assessments for eligibility to GP visit cards are being processed at present by the HSE.</P>

        <P>An Bord Altranais has statutory authority for the registration of nurses under the Nurses Act, 1985.</P>
        <P>I am sure that the Deputy will appreciate that An Bord Altranais must process each application thoroughly to ensure that all those entered on the register of nurses are deemed professionally qualified and competent for such registration. The protection of the public underpins this process. I am satisfied that the board discharges its functions in a professional manner.</P>
        <P>In 2004, over 3,500 newly registered qualifications were entered on the register. With regard to individual applications I am informed that decisions are normally issued to applicants within six weeks. However, errors or omissions in infor<Col N="552"/>mation supplied to the board can cause delays. It may be that reasons such as these have contributed to any delay in processing the application referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 157 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004 provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals, including psychologists, whether they are employed in the public service, the private health sector or are self employed. The qualifications required of registrants will be a matter for the relevant registration board under section 37 of the Bill and each board must <Col N="554"/>approve qualifications as attesting to the standard of proficiency required for registration.</P>
        <P>Section 91 of the Bill contains transitional arrangements for the registration of existing practitioners which will apply for a period of two years from the establishment of a register. These arrangements include the provision that practitioners who hold a stated qualification and who have been in practice at any time during a period of five years before the register was established shall be granted registration. A practitioner must also satisfy the registration board that he or she is a fit and proper person to engage in the practice of that profession.</P>
        <P>The stated qualification for psychologists under the grandparenting provisions set out in the Bill is a recognised university degree or diploma obtained with first or second class honours in which psychology was taken as a major subject and honours obtained in that subject.</P>
        <P>I should explain that this does not reflect the current qualifications required of persons recruited as psychologists within the public health service as, since 2002, psychologists recruited to the public health service have been required to hold a postgraduate qualification. The qualification set out in the Bill for psychologists is instead designed to take proper account of those practitioners previously recruited to the public health service and those who are practising elsewhere who may not hold a postgraduate qualification.</P>
        <P>I have given very careful consideration to the proposals put forward by the Psychological Society of Ireland in regard to qualifications held by applicants applying for registration under section 91. These proposals involve discriminating between psychologists working in the public service and those working elsewhere for the purposes of the transitional arrangements for the registration of existing practitioners. The legal advice available to me is that this would be inadvisable.</P>
        <P>I believe that the current provisions contained in the Bill for the grandparenting of practising psychologists are appropriate in the context of a transitional period and having regard to requirements in the public health service prior to 2002. I am also conscious that, in terms of the protection of the public, any registrant who does not meet the standard of proficiency and competence expected of registered professionals will be subject to the complaints, inquiries and disciplinary procedures set out in the Bill.</P>

	<P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility under category 1, namely medical card holders, or limited eligibility under category 2 for health services. The Health Service Executive normally regards a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; in Ireland if he or she satisfies the executive that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year. Temporary visitors from another EU country are entitled to necessary treatment free of charge under the European health insurance card.</P>
        <P>Persons in category 1 are are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all inpatient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all outpatient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.</P>
        <P>Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all inpatient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services and outpatient public hospital services including consultants services.</P>
        <P>Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, with the exception of people over the age of seventy years who are automatically entitled to a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for medical cards in the case of persons who have contracted MRSA will continue to be assessed on the same basis as all other persons.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 to 151, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Hawkins House is owned by the Office of Public Works and they are responsible for maintenance and ancillary works required to be carried out on the building.</P>
        <P>The OPW has confirmed that in June 1998 a preliminary survey of the boiler room in Hawkins House revealed small quantities of asbestos based thermal insulation. In February 1999, during the course of refurbishment works in the main foyer, further quantities of asbestos material were discovered on pipework embedded in the concrete floor. A more detailed survey of the building carried out in July 1999 uncovered isolated pockets of asbestos based materials in various forms such as ceiling tiles, duct linings and fire doors.</P>
        <P>The asbestos material discovered on pipework embedded in the concrete floor during the refurbishment works in the main foyer was not removed. It has been left <i>in situ</i> and completely sealed within the floor area where it poses no threat.</P>
        <P>The OPW advised that the isolated pockets of asbestos-based materials in various forms such as ceiling tiles, duct linings and fire doors should be left untouched. At present, left untouched, they pose no health risk.</P><Col N="558"/>
        <P>Following a tender competition carried out by the OPW, the material in the boiler room in Hawkins House was removed in February 1999 in accordance with all of the Department of Environment and Local Government, local authority and Health and Safety Authority regulations. Prior to the work the successful contractor forwarded to the Health and Safety Authority a method statement setting out how the asbestos would be safely removed and issued a notification of commencement of asbestos work to the health and safety authority. The system of work set out in the method statement ensured that the occupants of the building were not exposed to any risk during the removal works.</P>
        <P>This work was carried out in February 1999 and, at all times during the asbestos removal, my Department was kept advised of the potential risks involved if the material was not properly managed. Air tests were carried out by specialist consultants before, during and after works to provide assurances that there were no airborne fibres present and that, consequently, there was no danger to staff. Clearance certificates were issued at the time.</P>

	<P>As I have previously indicated to the House, I consider that appropriate transport arrangements for patients requiring radiotherapy should be made available, where necessary, by the Health Service Executive. My Department raised this matter with the HSE last May to ensure that appropriate transport arrangements are put in place on a national basis for patients who are required to travel to obtain radiotherapy. Transport solutions are already a feature of the current provision of radiation oncology services.</P>
        <P>Last July I announced the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services to be put in place by 2011 and commencing in 2008. The network will consist of four large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway and two integrated satellite centres at Waterford Regional Hospital and Limerick Regional Hospital. Appropriate transport arrangements will form part of the planning and implementation of this plan, given the significant increase in capacity involved.</P>
        <P>The national radiation oncology coordinating group provides advice to my Department and the HSE on radiotherapy. In light of the above and the fact that under the Health Act 2004, the HSE has responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, the NROCG does not intend to prepare a specific report on transport.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The income assessment guidelines used by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in considering applications for medical cards were increased by 7.5% with effect from 1 January 2005. Significant changes were also announced in the area of allowances to applicants in respect of dependants and reasonable expenses incurred in relation to mortgage, childcare and commuting to work. It was anticipated that these increases would result in a net additional 30,000 medical cards. To date, the net number of additional cards issued has not significantly exceeded the figure for the year end of 2004. My Department and the HSE are now reviewing the operation of the income assessment guidelines with a view to identifying what further changes may be required in order to enable the desired number of additional medical cards to be issued.</P>
        <P>Now that agreement has been reached between the parties on all aspects of the Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s recommendations of June 2005 the HSE is proceeding with the introduction of GP visit cards which will enable 200,000 people to have free access to general practitioner services under the general medical services scheme. Applications for assessments for eligibility to GP visit cards are being processed at present by the HSE.</P>

        <P>The Health Service Executive is working with hospitals in order to deliver these measures and to ensure that the investment produces sustainable solutions. There are also additional actions that are required which relate to processes and procedures affecting the throughput of patients in hospitals. These too will be addressed by the HSE.</P>
        <P>A particular focus has been placed on those patients in acute hospitals who have completed their acute phase of treatment and are ready for discharge to a more appropriate setting. The HSE is making sustained efforts to arrange for the discharge of these patients in order to have more acute beds available in hospitals for emergency patients. My Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy on the progress being made in this regard.</P>

	<P>My Department has made inquiries of the HSE on the issue raised by the Deputy and has been advised that the HSE is not aware of any risk to public health from mobile phone masts in the Whitestown industrial estate area. The consensus of scientific literature to date regarding possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields, or EMF, exposure from mobile phones and their base stations is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between such exposure and ill health. The World Health Organisation, WHO, has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in its 1998 guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects. These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature including thermal and non-thermal effects.</P>
        <P>In 1999 the European Community introduced recommendations on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, based on the ICNIRP guidelines. Ireland complies with these recommendations. The Commission for Communication Regulations (ComReg) monitors compliance with regard to telecommunication masts. I am advised that <Col N="569"/>monitoring has taken place at Whitestown industrial estate in Tallaght business park and that the results conclude that emissions are within ICNIRP guidelines. Research in this area is ongoing.</P>
        <P>The WHO has identified a need for further research to better assess possible health risks and has established the international electromagnetic fields (EMF) project. My Department will continue to monitor developments in relation to this issue.</P>

	<P>Cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs or family planning clinics under the scheme for medical card holders. However, where cervical smears form part of recognised protocols for the ongoing treatment of individual patient illnesses, they should be provided free of charge to eligible women under the general medical services, GMS, scheme. Any necessary follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. Following the publication of the international expert&rsquo;s report on the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out, my Department undertook a consultative process with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders. My Department will now discuss options for roll-out of the programme with the Health Service Executive. The arrangements for cervical screening within the context of the GMS are among the issues which will be considered in the discussions which have commenced on the GP contract for publicly provided services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Under Article 28(2)(e) of the sixth VAT directive the supply of electricity and gas is subject to the reduced VAT rate which in Ireland is 13.5%. This article allows member states which at 1 January 1991 applied a reduced rate to supplies of goods and services other than those specified in Annex H of the sixth VAT directive to continue to apply a reduced rate to such supplies.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11-?>
        <P>In the case of the supply of electricity a standing charge and a public service obligation, PSO, levy are also applied and both of these charges are subject to VAT at the 13.5% rate. For gas, a supply charge applies which is also subject to VAT at the 13.5% rate. I should explain that the PSO levy is based on the costs incurred by the ESB in meeting its obligations to produce, or buy electricity that is being generated from peat and other environmentally sustainable forms of energy. Up to March 2003, this levy was included in the standing charge on the bill but, since that date, the PSO levy has been shown separately on electricity bills. The method through which VAT must be calculated is set out under section 10 of the Value Added Tax Act 1972 (as amended). In this regard, VAT must be charged on the total <Col N="573"/>consideration for the supply of goods or services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges but not including value-added tax chargeable in respect of the supply itself.</P>
        <P>In respect of charges for other goods or services included on electricity or gas bills, a VAT rate appropriate to those additional goods or services will be included in the bill. For example, an electricity or gas bill might include a repayment on the purchase of a domestic appliance which would be liable to the standard VAT rate of 21%. However, this would not affect the rate of VAT applied to the supply of gas or electricity which is 13.5%.</P>

	<P>Proposals for alleviating the risk of flooding in Clonmel were placed on public display during the month of May this year. The exhibition was well attended and a large number of observations were received. These observations have now been considered by the Office of Public Works and the steering committee on the Clonmel project, which includes officials from Clonmel Borough Council and South Tipperary County Council, and responses are currently being prepared. Discussions are also ongoing with some landowners to resolve specific issues on the schemes.</P>
        <P>Tenders have been received for the site investigation contract and are currently being examined, with the intention to proceed with the investigation work upon conclusion of the vetting process. A brief has also been prepared in relation to the supply of demountable flood defences and it is hoped to advertise for this shortly. The site investigation must be complete before the detailed design of the schemes can be undertaken. These investigations along with the detailed design, which will be followed by the procurement process for a works contractor mean that works could commence in the autumn of 2006. The OPW will carefully monitor the programme in order to commence works at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data on the number of first-time buyers is only available in part through stamp duty receipts. However, as not all first-time buyers are liable to stamp duty and where stamp duty receipts refer to more than one category of buyer, reliable statistics regarding the number of first-time buyers cannot be determined.</P>
        <P>No stamp duty applies in the case of new residential property for owner occupiers including first time buyers, which does not exceed 125 sq. m. in floor area. In this respect no information is available as regards such purchasers. In addition, as stamp duty rates for property transactions <Col N="578"/>exceeding &euro;381,000 (up to 1 December 2004) and exceeding &euro;635,000 (on or after 2 December 2004) were the same for all residential purchasers, it is not possible to distinguish first time buyer transactions in excess of these values. However, where first-time buyers paid stamp duty at a lower rate than other buyers, this category of buyers is separately identifiable as first-time buyers and as such a record of their number exists. In this respect, the number of transactions relating to first time buyers paying stamp duty at these particular rates in 2004 was 7,632.</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in its annual housing statistics bulletin, estimates that 34% of all new houses purchased in 2004 were bought by first-time buyers.</P>

	<P>Work on the River Nore, Kilkenny City, drainage scheme was carried out by the Office of Public Works under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. These Acts also make provision for the assessment and payment of compensation in respect of works carried out under the scheme. Where it is felt that loss or damage has been suffered as a result of the works, it is open to the party concerned to submit a claim for compensation upon completion of the scheme. It should be noted that any benefit incurred to a property as a result of the scheme works will be offset against any losses sustained. To date, the Office of Public Works has received seven compensation claims. While all claims have not yet been settled the amount awarded to date, inclusive of costs, is &euro;259,979.02.</P>

	<P>The Office of Public Works&rsquo; consulting engineers, E. G. Pettit &amp; Company, have established that the ground floor level of the building in question is above the predicted 100 year flood level by 1.75 m and therefore should not be susceptible to flooding from this extreme event. However, it is accepted that the basement level of the building in question is 0.6 m below the same flood level. There is an embankment between the river and the building in question and it is our intention, with the owner&rsquo;s permission, to carry out investigations as part of the site investigation contract to discover the permeability of this embankment. Should works be required to make this embankment impermeable then it will be examined at detailed design stage. I have arranged for the consulting engineer to contact the owner of the hotel to discuss the matter.</P>

        <P FLI="0">Data on the recorded catch by commercial salmon fishermen in 2005 will not be formally available until later this month and early next year in the case of the angling catch, when full analysis of exploitation during the season has been completed by the central and regional fisheries boards. The scheme has seen the TAC from 219,619 fish in 2002 to 139,900 fish for the 2005 season. This represents a cut of over 36% over a four year period.</P>
        <P>The tagging scheme is operated by the central and regional fisheries boards and is designed, among other things, to deliver accurate statistics on the commercial and recreational wild salmon and sea trout fisheries, fishing activity and sales and disposals. I am advised by the fisheries boards that the scheme has made it easier to identify illegally caught salmon, restrict sales outlets for such fish and to provide traceability into the distribution chain. Importantly, it has provided an opportunity to enhance the sale value of wild fish in that it offers on-line traceability to purchasers of salmon and acts as a quality symbol to enhance the reputation and value of wild caught salmon.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the central fisheries board, which co-ordinates the tagging scheme nationally, that the average cost of the scheme over the four year period from 2002 to 2005 is approximately &euro;870,000 per annum and that this funding has been provided out of the annual Exchequer allocation to the fisheries boards.</P>
        <P>As marine Minister, I rely on the advice of the national salmon commission and the management of the central and regional fisheries boards when deciding the total allowable commercial catch of salmon each year. In national terms, the latest scientific advice made available to me by the standing scientific committee of the national salmon commission is that while there remains an abundance of salmon returning to Irish rivers, the maximum harvest by all fishing methods should not exceed 122,541 fish in 2005. The scientific advice does not distinguish how this catch should be distributed between the various types of fishing engines.</P>
        <P>In setting the total allowable commercial catch for 2005 at 139,900 salmon, I recognise that there have been strong concerns expressed over the divergence in the advice from the national salmon commission and that of its standing scientific committee. However, the basis of the scientific advice changed this year and the immediate adoption of the new advice would have meant an additional cut of over 30% on the actual TAC in 2005. This would have placed an unreasonable burden on the coastal fishing communities that depend on the salmon resource for their livelihoods. I have asked the new national salmon commission to advise me on the measures needed to ensure that we align the exploitation of salmon on the scientific advice by 2007.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a considerable body of legislation, both primary and secondary, relating to the illegal capture of fish from rivers. This legislation is in place to conserve and protect our inland fisheries. Primary responsibility for enforcement of this legislation rests with the central and regional fisheries boards. Each year the Department provides over &euro;20 million from the Exchequer to the fisheries boards, which employ some 385 staff to carry out their statutory functions. I am satisfied that illegal fishing will not be condoned in any region. Management fully supports staff in the enforcement of this legislation and ensure that staff are trained on an ongoing basis and are fully competent in carrying out their duties.</P>

	<P>On 18 May, the Department received a letter from Dublin Port Company requesting ministerial approval for its proposal to enter into an arrangement with a consortium as detailed in draft heads of terms attached to the letter. The company states that, in essence, the proposal provides that, in the event that the consortium is successful in its bid for the development of the national conference centre and appropriate planning and other consents issue in respect of the national conference centre, Dublin Port Company will make available a site in order to facilitate the development of the national conference centre together with further and complementary commercial development.</P>
        <P>The Department had a number of consultations with the Department of Finance regarding the application of the code of practice and the <Col N="584"/>legislative provisions relevant to the particular case presented to it by Dublin Port Company. In this context, the two Departments agreed that it was necessary to seek the advice of the Attorney General on the matter, in particular regarding the process applicable to the proposal by Dublin Port Company to make available to the Anna Livia Consortium a site in order to facilitate the development of the national conference centre together with further and complementary commercial development. Some advice was received from the Attorney General on 29 July 2005 in this regard and further advice is awaited. A reply to the Dublin Port Company letter of 18 May will issue when all the necessary advice is to hand and fully considered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Wicklow Port Company operates under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000. Under the Acts, the primary function of the company is the management, control, operation and development of its harbour ensuring that its revenue is sufficient to meet its expenditure. The ports policy statement, published in January 2005, sets out Government policy on plans for the development of ports and harbours. It is available to view on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The ports policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs through: better transport policy coordination; clearer and more focused commercial mandates for the ports and their boards; reform of the structure of port boards; encouragement of private sector investment and involvement; sanction for the use of non-core assets to fund new port development but not to mask inefficiencies; encouragement of healthy competitive conditions within and between ports; better consultation and dispute resolution between port companies and users through appropriate information sharing and arbitration mechanisms; and encouragement of mergers where a business case exists.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as an island, is dependent on sea-borne trade and the economic significance and importance of our ports to the prosperity of the country is self evident. Given our small, open economy, Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness is central to overall economic performance.</P>
        <P>The Government expects that the port companies, as commercial entities, should be capable of funding their operations and infrastructure requirements without relying on Exchequer support. The port companies are, therefore, encouraged to seek financial assistance from other avenues such as private sector investment within ports.</P>
        <P>On Arklow harbour, as indicated in the ports policy statement, it is proposed that the regional harbours still operating under the Harbours Act 1946 will be transferred to local authority or port company control. Under this policy, consideration is being given to a proposal to transfer Arklow harbour to Wicklow County Council.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are at present considering the modalities for the transfer of the regional harbours to local authority ownership. The relevant local authorities have been requested to undertake an overall <Col N="586"/>assessment and report on their potential for transfer.</P>
        <P>Pending the above transfers, the Department spent a total of &euro;1.25 million in 2004 on essential works at regional harbours, to protect the public and the fabric of these harbours, &euro;450,000 of which was provided to Arklow harbour. In 2005, a similar programme of essential works is being undertaken at Arklow harbour at a cost of &euro;1.6 million. I have just approved a further &euro;170,000 for additional minor works at the harbour.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by ComReg, the commission for communications regulation.</P>
        <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the county and group broadband scheme, GBS. My Department is currently administering the second call for the county and group broadband scheme. This scheme is designed to promote investment in broadband access infrastructure in rural communities with populations of 1,500 or less by contributing grant aid of up to 55% of the infrastructure costs. The county and group broadband scheme is co-funded by the e-commerce and communications measures of the border, midlands and western and the southern and eastern regional operational programmes of the national development plan.</P>
        <P>Under the second call of the GBS, a total of 119 projects have been approved to date. So far, this represents an investment of &euro;12.4 million in 445 communities covering a population of 355,000. In total, grant aid of almost &euro;5 million has been approved to date.</P>
        <P>While signed petitions were not a requirement for eligibility under the scheme, my Department did indicate that evidence of the level of demand for broadband services in the local community may be required. It was a matter for the applicants to demonstrate demand in whatever way they deemed appropriate and some did rely on petitions as evidence of interest.</P>
        <P>I should also add that my Department, in partnership with local authorities, is constructing open access high speed networks in up to 120 large towns with populations over 1,500 persons.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 216 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator. The upgrading of the Eircom exchange in Bray is a matter for the company concerned.</P>
        <P>It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband, so my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.</P>
        <P>Some 19 MANs are now completed, and a further seven are nearing completion. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in a further 93 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the sector. Design and procurement has already commenced in four towns in Wicklow under phase two, namely Kilcoole, Enniskerry, Newtownmountkennedy and Blessington.</P>
        <P>For rural communities and smaller towns, such as Kilmacanogue and the hinterlands of larger towns, my Department offers funding under the county and group broadband scheme to enable these communities to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with the service providers. To date there are four schemes approved for Wicklow County &mdash; Rathdrum, North East Wicklow, Carnew and Laragh. Full details of the scheme, including application procedures, are on the website <i>www.gbs.gov.ie</i>.</P><Col N="588"/>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.broadband.<?oasys _jy?>gov.ie</i> lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in Wicklow, and gives contact details for each company, together with prices for the various service levels on offer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 559, 560, 561 and 562 of 28 September 2005, certain issues arose concerning Dublin Port Company&rsquo;s title to the area in which it is proposed to carry out the reclamation. These matters have been the subject of detailed correspondence between the State&rsquo;s legal services and the company&rsquo;s legal advisors, and it is anticipated that they will be brought to a conclusion in the near future.</P>
        <P>The application itself will be examined further, in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Foreshore Acts, when these legal matters are concluded. The foreshore process will include a <Col N="589"/>period of public consultation, providing an opportunity for interested persons or bodies to make submissions or observations on the proposal.</P>
        <P>The proposed development will also require planning permission, and Dublin Port Company has been advised that it is more appropriate that the necessary consent under the planning process be obtained before the foreshore application is dealt with.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement, which I launched in January 2005, addressed among other things, the issue of future seaport capacity requirements. When launching the ports policy statement, I indicated that one of the key challenges ahead was the timely provision of adequate in-time port capacity.</P>
        <P>As an initial step, the Department sought information from the commercial ports which handle unit load cargo, including Dublin port, on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond. In its response to this request, Dublin Port Company provided information to the Department concerning its proposal for the reclamation of 21 hectares of foreshore in Dublin bay.</P>
        <P>As indicated in the ports policy statement, it is intended to prioritise a range of projects catering for unitised traffic at our commercial ports from an overall economic national and regional perspective, as opposed to the perceived requirements of individual ports. To that end, the Department recently appointed Fisher Associates, consultants, to advise on refining the criteria to be used for project evaluation; drawing up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals; assessing the scope for efficiencies within existing areas of ports handling unitised trade; and evaluating the projects submitted with a view to the Department&rsquo;s recommendations to Government.</P>
        <P>As an initial step in their assignment, I understand that Fisher Associates will shortly consult with ports, including Dublin and other key stakeholders on the criteria to be used for project evaluation.</P>

        <P>With regard to the action open to the local community, the physical siting of telecommunication masts is a matter for the relevant local authorities under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I am advised that there is currently no scientific or medical evidence that emissions below the level of the internationally recognised guidelines from mobile telephone masts are injurious to health. Ireland has adopted European Union Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on &ldquo;the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, 0 Hz to 300 GHz&rdquo;, 1999/519/EC, and the guidelines established by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and participates in the work of the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety, which sets standards in this area. All licensed telecommunications operators in Ireland are required by the terms of their licences to observe the ICNIRP guidelines for limiting exposure of the public to electromagnetic emissions from their facilities.</P>

	<P>I believe that An Post plays a key role, both in delivery of mails and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. However, there is universal agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future.</P>
        <P>With this in mind, the board and management of An Post have presented a recovery plan, incorporating details of proposed new collection and delivery arrangements, which I believe is vital to the re-establishment of the company on a more secure financial footing. The plan has assumed significant changes in work practices, tariff increases and the payment of wage increases. It sets out the way forward for the company. Adoption of restructuring that delivers real change is the only way that An Post can re-establish itself on a firm financial footing.</P>
        <P>In order to progress the change agenda, I have met twice with representatives of the main union <Col N="591"/>in An Post, the Communications Workers Union, CWU, and met also with representatives of the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, on a total of three occasions. I have listened with interest to the views of all parties concerned in relation to the future of the network and I have emphasised to all parties the importance of an early start to the company&rsquo;s modernisation and that management and staff sides must engage directly in order to resolve longstanding and deep-seated problems besetting the company.</P>

	<P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of my Department. In addition to providing advice and supporting networks of efficiency minded organisations and companies, it funds pilot and exemplary projects that deploy energy efficient technologies and are based on renewables.</P>
        <P>Regular reviews are conducted on all SEI&rsquo;s funding programmes. Factors entering any such consideration include the establishment of consumer product standards, supplier capability and installation quality assurance systems appropriate to consumer markets. This is in addition to the core requirements of energy and CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> saving impact, market impact potential, administrative efficiency and ultimately, value for money for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Energy price increases are a strong stimulus to us to look at how much and how we use fuels. There are three main ways to reduce our energy demand: eliminating waste, cutting back on demand and using fuels more efficiently. Every stage of every process, whether industrial, commercial or domestic, will yield efficiencies when examined and all these savings will aggregate to form a substantial total. Even while preserving our economic growth, energy efficiency will allow us to reduce our energy demand meaning a saving on fuel import bills, a contribution to our Kyoto commitment on greenhouse gases and a payback to the Exchequer and to individuals.</P><Col N="592"/>
        <P>I am keen to see a wider take up of energy efficient technology in buildings, industry and transport. While many of the measures involved are self-financing, with payback periods of as little as two or three years, I am looking at what incentives might be needed to improve the rate of take-up and use. For example, increasing the energy efficiency of our building stock reduces our energy imports, reduces our CO<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> emissions and saves money for the individual household and for the Exchequer.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the ESRI recommendations. However, due to the significant impact any changes to the electricity sector can have on consumers and to the economic well-being of the country, it is important that any decisions regarding future structure are taken on the basis of robust, independent analysis and advice. As previously confirmed to the House, I have appointed Deloitte &amp; Touche to carry out a detailed independent review of the electricity sector in Ireland. This is to include a detailed examination of ESB&rsquo;s vertically integrated utility structure and its dominance in the sector, particularly in the area of power generation.</P>
        <P>The review is currently underway and I am expecting the final report by the end of this year. As part of this report, the consultants will be required to make specific recommendations as to the most appropriate institutional arrangements and company structures, including ownership models, for the ESB and, to the extent appropriate, for the electricity sector in general. If the recommendations are leading towards any change in the structure of ESB, I would expect them to be supported by a detailed business case for any proposals.</P>

        <P>A related but wider concern is to seek to end the culture of impunity which has persisted for too long in Burundi. The establishment of a national truth and reconciliation commission and the strengthening of the Burundian judicial system proposed by Secretary General Annan should contribute significantly to ending the culture of impunity as well as hopefully giving renewed impetus into the investigation of the many unsolved murders, including those of Mr. <Col N="594"/>Mfayokurera and Mr. Ndikumana, committed in Burundi during its recent conflict.</P>
        <P>On 20 June 2005 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1606, which authorises the UN Secretary General to enter into consultations with the Burundian Government and parties on his proposals for establishment of a national truth and reconciliation commission, as provided for in the 2000 Arusha peace accords, as well as setting up a special chamber within the Burundian judicial system to try those suspected of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since Burundian independence in 1962. Talks on establishing both these mechanisms are likely to commence shortly, following the installation on 26 August of the new democratically elected Burundian Government, led by President Nkurunziza.</P>

	<P>The information available to my Department regarding the status of the investigation into the attempted assassination of Mr. Ndihokubwayo remains as stated in my reply to the Deputy of 5 May 2005.</P>
        <P>A related but wider concern is to seek to end the culture of impunity which has persisted for too long in Burundi. The establishment of a national truth and reconciliation commission and the strengthening of the Burundian judicial system proposed by Secretary General Annan should contribute significantly to ending the culture of impunity as well as hopefully helping to shed light on the many crimes, including those against Mr. Ndihokubwayo, for which those responsible have not yet been brought to justice.</P>
        <P>On 20 June 2005 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1606, which authorises the UN Secretary General to enter into consultations with the Burundian Government and parties on his proposals for establishment of a national truth and reconciliation commission, as provided for in the 2000 Arusha peace accords, as well as setting up a special chamber within the Burundian judicial system to try those suspected of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed since Burundian independence in 1962. Talks on establishing both these mechanisms are likely to commence shortly, following the installation on 26 August of the new democratically-elected Burundian Government, led by President Nkurunziza.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 to 230, inclusive, 244 and 245 together.</P>
        <P>In my responses of 5 and 10 May 2005 to written questions from the Deputy regarding these cases, I referred to the importance for the Colombian peace process of a comprehensive legal framework for the process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the illegal armed groups, based on the principles of truth, justice and reparation. These issues are addressed in the recently passed Columbian peace and justice law. That law provides an overall legal framework for demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into society. The law, which was adopted through a lengthy <Col N="596"/>democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.</P>
        <P>The General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union adopted conclusions on Colombia at its meeting on Monday 3 October 2005. Ireland was actively involved in the negotiation of these conclusions, which principally address the justice and peace law. The overall assessment of the Council was that, if implemented effectively and in a transparent manner, the law will have a positive effect on peace building in Colombia.</P>
        <P>The conclusions address the need for a negotiated peace settlement and call for illegal armed groups to demobilise. They also call on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and international humanitarian law and commend the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia. The conclusions also confirm the readiness of the EU and its member states to assist the Colombian Government and civil society in providing support for communities affected by the internal conflict, victims groups, local reconciliation activities and the reinsertion and demobilisation of child soldiers.</P>
        <P>I recently announced Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to contribute &euro;390,000 over a three year period to the Organization of American States, OAS, peace and verification mission in Colombia. The mission&rsquo;s mandate is to provide comprehensive support to the Colombian peace process with a focus both on the demobilization process and on the strengthening of institutions concerned with the rule of law. Promoting and defending human rights and justice are guiding principles of the mission. Ireland will work closely with its colleagues in this mission, including in ensuring that human rights standards are maintained during the process.</P>
        <P>Ireland was actively involved in negotiating the recent chairperson&rsquo;s statement on the situation of human rights in Colombia which was adopted on 22 April 2005 at the 61st session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The statement appeals to the government of Colombia increasingly to address the issue of impunity and to take action to improve the capacity and effectiveness of the judicial system and to take action where evidence of collusion with paramilitary forces is found.</P>
        <P>My Department will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia, and particularly the implementation of the justice and peace law, through our embassy in Mexico City, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident embassies in Colombia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Regrettably, there has been no progress towards the release of these 11 Eritrean parliamentarians since I replied to the Deputy&rsquo;s Question No. 220 on 10 May 2005. Ireland is greatly concerned by the negative human rights situation in Eritrea and the authorities&rsquo; unwillingness to respond to concerns expressed by the European Union and the international community. Although Eritrea has ratified relevant international agreements for the protection of human rights, the fact that the 1997 constitution has not been implemented denies Eritreans a framework within which their rights are acknowledged, including the right to appeal to an independent judiciary. The European Union remains engaged in political dialogue with the Eritrean Government, within the framework of the Cotonou Agreement. However, due to that Government&rsquo;s preoccupation with the continuing stalemate in the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace process and its consequent unwillingness to address other sensitive issues, little progress has been made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to my reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question of 10 May. Of the 15, the most prominent cases have been those of Ms Leyla Zana and three other members of her Democracy Party, DEP, Mr Hatip Dicle, Mr Orhan Dogan and Mr. Selim Sadak. The second retrial of their case, which opened in December 2004, is continuing. A hearing took place in Ankara on Friday 7 October and the next hearing is scheduled to take place in December. The trial is expected to last approximately six months. Together with our EU partners, our Embassy in Ankara is continuing to monitor developments in the case. Of the 11 other former parliamentarians, the situation as outlined in the response to the Deputy&rsquo;s question in May has not changed.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on Monday 3 October the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, approved a framework for negotiations with Turkey which enabled accession talks to open as envisaged by the European Council last December. The shared objective of the EU Turkey negotiations is accession. It will be an open-ended process, the outcome of which will not be guaranteed in advance.</P>
        <P>In recent years since the election of the government of Prime Minister Recep Tagyip Erdogan, Turkey has made very significant progress in the adoption of wide-ranging political reforms. <Col N="598"/>Throughout the accession negotiations, the European Union will expect Turkey to sustain the process of reform which it has already begun and to work towards further improvements including in respect of the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to consolidate and broaden legislation and implementation measures in relation to freedom of expression, freedom of religion, women&rsquo;s rights, trade union rights and minority rights.</P>

        <P>In recent years since the election of the Government of Prime Minister Erdogan, Turkey has made very significant progress in the adoption of wide-ranging political reforms. Throughout the accession negotiations, the European Union will expect Turkey to sustain the process of reform which it has already begun and to work towards further improvements including in respect of the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Parallel to the accession negotiations, the EU will also engage with Turkey in an intensive political and civil society dialogue. In our contacts with the Turkish Government, we will continue to emphasise the central importance of full implementation of all aspects of Turkey&rsquo;s reform legislation.</P>

	<P>Mr. Roy Bennett, the former Movement for Democratic Change, MDC, member of the Zimbabwean Parliament, was released from <Col N="599"/>prison on 28 June 2005, having served eight months of the 12-month sentence imposed on him for pushing the Zimbabwean Justice Minister during a parliamentary debate in May 2004. In a statement which I issued at the time, I very much welcomed Mr. Bennett&rsquo;s release, while noting that his description of the ill-treatment and beatings to which he and other inmates were subjected in prison, had only served to highlight once again the need for democratic reforms and improved respect for human rights in Zimbabwe.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, opposition politicians and supporters and members of civil society, including the other 32 parliamentarians referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, continue to be subjected to ongoing harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrest and imprisonment by the Zimbabwean authorities.</P>
        <P>The human rights situation in Zimbabwe has, if anything, deteriorated even further in recent weeks, following the approval by the Zimbabwean Parliament of a series of constitutional changes which will allow the government, <i>inter alia</i>, to impose travel bans on those suspected of undermining the national interest. Ireland and our EU partners will continue to take the lead internationally, including at the current UN General Assembly session, in highlighting the serious human rights situation in Zimbabwe and pressing for an end to attacks on basic human freedoms by the Zimbabwean authorities.</P>

        <P>There have been some developments in these cases since my reply to Questions Nos. 215 and 216 from the Deputy on 10 May 2005. I understand that Mr. Asif Ali Zardari, leader of the Pakistan People&rsquo;s Party and husband of exiled former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, has recently been in the United States receiving treatment for a heart condition. In early September, his re-arrest was ordered by an anti-corruption court in Pakistan for failure to attend trial hearings. Lawyers for Mr. Zardari have said that they <Col N="602"/>informed the court that he was unable to attend due to his illness.</P>
        <P>I am advised also that Mr. Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, leader of the Alliance for Restoration of Democracy Party, who is serving a 23-year prison sentence for charges relating to defamation of the Pakistan authorities, applied for bail in July. I understand the Supreme Court decided not to take up the bail application due to a shortage of time and adjourned the case for an indefinite period.</P>
        <P>Ireland and our EU partners continue to discuss human rights and democratisation issues with the Pakistan authorities on a regular basis. On 30 June last, the EU Troika of Heads of mission in Islamabad carried out the regular half-yearly human rights d&eacute;marche with the Secretary of the Pakistani Ministry of Law, Justice and Human Rights. Concerns about human rights were conveyed and the case of Mr. Zardari was raised. We will continue to monitor closely the two cases the Deputy has raised in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>The Patten report recommended the establishment of a human rights-orientated, community police force in Northern Ireland. The force was to be democratically accountable and reflective of the community it served. In his latest report, the oversight commissioner, who monitors the implementation of the Patten reforms, stated that 65% of the recommendations had been fully implemented and that overall progress was very satisfactory. The main obstacles to full implementation of the vision of Patten were a lack of full support from the community and the ongoing street disturbances associated with the marching season.</P>
        <P>I have had meetings with many of the key stakeholders in policing in Northern Ireland, including the Chief Constable, the Police Ombudsman, members of the policing board and district policing partnerships. I concur with the Oversight Commissioner for Policing, Al Hutchinson, in his assessment that a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland is well under way. I have also consistently underlined the need for all <Col N="604"/>parties to give their support to the new policing arrangements.</P>
        <P>In the context of local policing, the British Government has also stated that it is considering introducing community support officers in Northern Ireland. These officers would carry out patrols and exercise certain limited functions in dealing with anti-social behaviour but would not have the powers of a fully-fledged police officer. The British authorities have stated that recruits would be subject to the same vetting as regular police officers. In line with its commitment to the full implementation of the Patten report, the Government will be in continuing discussion with the British Government on this and other aspects of policing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A new chapter opened in bilateral relations between Ireland and Ukraine after the momentous democratic change which culminated in the inauguration of Viktor Yushchenko as President last January. I am pleased to say that contacts at political level have been stepped up very considerably. The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, represented Ireland at the inauguration of President Yushcenko. In April, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, had a meeting at Shannon with President Yushchenko and Foreign Minister Tarasiuk. In July, I had the pleasure of being the first Irish Foreign Minister to make an official visit to Ukraine. My visit included substantive discussion of bilateral relations, as well as EU-Ukraine relations and regional issues of mutual interest, with President Yushchenko, Parliamentary Speaker Lytvyn and Foreign Minister Tarasiuk. The Ceann Comhairle and six members of the Oireachtas visited Kiev last week at the invitation of the Speaker and had an equally full programme of meetings. I have accepted Foreign Minister Tarasiuk&rsquo;s proposal that he make a return official visit to Ireland later this month to sustain the momentum and move the developing relationship forward.</P>
        <P>Ukraine faces huge challenges in consolidating democratic accountability and pushing forward with political and economic reform. To the extent possible, I want Ireland to encourage and support Ukraine politically and practically in this process. The European Union and many member states are similarly engaged. There is, for example, strong interest on the Ukrainian side in being able to learn from Ireland&rsquo;s experience of econ<Col N="605"/>omic transformation. I was pleased to be able to announce in Kiev that Ireland is ready to assist Ukraine in the area of administrative capacity building, in the amount of one million euro over a three-year period.</P>
        <P>The European Council decided last December that EU-Ukraine relations would be intensified through the European neighbourhood policy. The three year joint action plan signed on 22 February is the instrument through which the EU is supporting political and economic reform in Ukraine. The EU-Ukraine Summit in Kiev on 1 December will take stock of progress in implementation of the action plan. Under the Treaty on European Union, Ukraine as a European country is eligible to apply for membership of the EU provided it complies with the relevant criteria. I articulated this position when in Kiev in July. I signalled that if, in the future, Ukraine sought to exercise its right to apply for membership, Ireland would in principal be generally supportive. I noted at the same time that there was a mood among the people of the Union to hasten slowly as regards enlargement beyond those already in prospect. Fundamentally, it would be a matter for the people of Ukraine, their Parliament and leaders to ensure that the necessary reforms were put in place to meet the criteria for membership. The Union&rsquo;s absorption capacity would also be a significant factor, as is set out in the Copenhagen criteria.</P>

	<P>My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is responsible for aviation policy. From a tourism perspective, I have made my views on this issue known on many occasions. I support the renegotiation of the Ireland-US Bilateral Air Agreement as a means of enhancing the benefits to Ireland from additional air services and enhanced visitor flows to both Shannon and Dublin. However, I am also conscious of the need to provide for an orderly phasing out of the Shannon stop requirements, thereby enabling the new airport authority in Shannon to build up its overall business and develop a medium to long-term strategy to optimise the significant potential for expansion on the transatlantic route.</P>
        <P>This was the clear recommendation arising from the tourism policy review group report &mdash; New Horizons for Irish Tourism &mdash; and the tourism action plan implementation group has re-iterated the urgent need to resolve this issue. In that <Col N="606"/>context, the views expressed by Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s Chief Executive at a recent hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport and Tourism were completely in accordance with my own. Ireland needs to ensure it is ideally positioned to capitalise on US tourism business and Shannon Airport is, and will remain, a key player in bringing this business to Ireland and the west, in particular.</P>

	<P>I have not been approached, in recent times, by the community games organisation for a meeting. As the Deputy is aware, following a series of meetings last year with representatives of the National Community Games to discuss issues relating to the hosting of the annual community games finals in Mosney, I approved funding of &euro;100,000 towards the renovation of the accommodation at the Mosney holiday centre specifically to ensure that the facilities there were of a comfortable standard for use by the community games participants. In the context of those discussions the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, confirmed its continuing willingness to facilitate the availability of Mosney to host the community games.</P><Col N="607"/>
        <P>The community games representatives have expressed their satisfaction with the range and quality of the facilities and services available at Mosney and their suitability for future national events. They also acknowledged that there is no other venue in Ireland with the scale and variety of facilities required for their national events as currently structured and also that any question of providing a special, dedicated venue on the scale required, which would be used only a few times a year, would be completely unrealistic.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the RIA has confirmed that for as long as the agency continues to use Mosney, the community games can avail of the facilities there. A new contract for the use of the centre was signed between Mosney Irish Holidays Limited and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 18 November 2004.</P>

	<P>I have discussed preparations for the Beijing Olympics with both the president of the Olympic Council of Ireland and the chairman of the Sports Council and am at one with them on the need to ensure that our preparations for Beijing take cognisance of the issues highlighted in the Athens review. Accordingly, I welcome the fact that the Irish Sports Council has put together an operational plan, which identifies key performance indicators, timescales and costings and the roles of the various agencies in supporting Ireland&rsquo;s Olympic and Paralympic preparations for Beijing. The plan encompasses elements such as the introduction of targeted sport performance plans including prioritising junior, development and elite athletes; a review of the international carding scheme; proposals for the development of an Irish institute of sport; maintaining and enhancing the role of the Olympic and Paralympic performance committees to ensure optimum co-operation in the preparation and performance of the Irish team for the Beijing Olympic games, and the strengthening of the Olympic Council of Ireland&rsquo;s administrative capacities.</P>
        <P>The Olympic performance committee and the Paralympic performance committees have met on a number of occasions in 2005.

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has a policy on records management covering procedures relating to the creation, maintenance and eventual disposition of records. The policy, <i>inter alia</i>, includes the legal requirements relating to the preservation of records in accordance with the National Archives and freedom of information legislation and sets out procedures concerning the preservation of electronic records, including e-mail, computer generated reports and documents prepared on personal productivity software, for example, word processing software.</P>
        <P>The immediate issue for my Department is the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme which poses significant challenges in regard to the preservation and maintenance of the integrity of all my Department&rsquo;s records, not least those in electronic format. This is a key issue which is being addressed in the context of the risk analysis carried out in regard to the Department&rsquo;s implementation of the decentralisation programme.</P>
        <P>In the wider context, much of the business of Government is now transacted electronically and departmental records are increasingly being created and maintained electronically. Other records that were created on paper are being digitised as part of large-scale projects linked to the delivery of e-Government. The digital versions of the latter records also have to be maintained electronically. The preservation of these records presents a number of challenges.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the National Archives which is part of my Department has statutory <Col N="609"/>responsibility for departmental records, that is, the records of all Departments, the courts and the bodies listed in the Schedule to the National Archives Act 1986. It oversees the ongoing implementation of the provisions of the Act, and the regulations and guidelines made under the Act, with regard to the preservation or disposal of such records and their transfer to the National Archives.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the National Archives Act 1986, the long-term preservation of electronic records is the responsibility of the National Archives while in the short term each Department and public body has responsibility for the preservation of its own electronic records. As yet there is no proven long-term storage medium for the preservation of records in digital form. To guard against loss of records due to the physical deterioration of the media on which they are stored, regular and continuing migration of such records to new storage media is required. Records created in proprietary software systems will have to be carried forward through later versions of these proprietary formats or, if practicable, exported to non-proprietary formats for permanent preservation. One of the challenges will be to maintain functionality of systems over time in these circumstances. Migration of records to new systems and formats will have to be undertaken in ways that will ensure their authenticity, reliability and evidential value over time.</P>
        <P>As a first step in addressing these and other electronic record issues, in June 2003, I appointed to the staff of the National Archives a professionally qualified archivist with specific and exclusive responsibility for electronic records. Since then some progress has been made in the development of an electronic records unit within the National Archives, the development of strategies for the long-term preservation of electronic records covered by the National Archives Act and in drafting guidelines for the management of electronic records so as to ensure their survival as archives. Unfortunately that programme of work has been interrupted due to the recent resignation of the archivist. My Department is actively engaged with the Public Appointments Service to have this specialist vacancy filled. Further initiatives to increase the necessary skill base in the National Archives are also being actively pursued to ensure that in due course all Departments-offices will be provided with best practice guidelines for the maintenance of electronic records.</P>

	<P>The National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, has legislative responsibility for all metrology in the State. The Metrology Act 1996 provided for the establishment of a legal metrology service within Forbairt and for its functions to be exercised through the director of legal metrology. Section 21 of that Act deals exclusively with national metrology functions and defines the legal basis and locus of responsibility for functions related to all metrology in the State. Subsequently, responsibility for metrology was transferred from Forbairt to the NSAI by virtue of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998. Section 51 of this Act also gave specific responsibility to NSAI &ldquo;to promote the use and application of metrology in the State&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the marketing of Ireland, including its regions and areas, to over<Col N="611"/>seas investors for foreign direct investment, FDI. IDA Ireland has informed me that it is actively seeking to win new projects for Kerry in more advanced, higher value activities, in both manufacturing and services. In addition to its ongoing marketing of the county to potential new investors, it is also actively seeking to facilitate a progression in the sophistication and breadth of its existing clients&rsquo; Irish operations. This means not only increasing value added in client manufacturing operations, but also adding corporate level innovation such as research and development and service, logistics and supply chain management functions alongside manufacturing.</P>
        <P>The objective is to create more rounded and strategically important operations within the overall corporation which are better embedded and more suited to the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy in the medium to long term. I am pleased that IDA Ireland is making some progress in this regard with two expansion projects announced in April 2004 for Killarney and a third for Kenmare announced in November 2004. At the end of 2004, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA supported companies in County Kerry.

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland, including its regions and areas. As part of its FDI promotion and regional development role, IDA has an ongoing and successful relationship with the third level education sector in the south east. I understand from IDA that the absence of a university in the south east has not emerged as a limiting factor in promoting FDI to potential new and or existing clients. I understand the focus of IDA client companies and potential investors has been on the range and quality of courses and graduate output of the existing institutions. They are concerned principally with capability and not the legislative status of the relevant institution.</P>
        <P>The key issue for foreign investors, therefore, is that educational institutions in the south east execute their remit to the highest possible standard. There are three areas that IDA considers very important and which the organisation discusses with all third level institutions, including those in the south east. These include the quality and relevance of course offerings in terms of enterprise development, engagement between the local institution and industry, both regionally and nationally, and research capability, identifying, marketing and developing the institution&rsquo;s capabilities.</P>
        <P>For example, the Waterford Institute of Technology has been very receptive to the IDA&rsquo;s message and has recently introduced a new manufacturing course that reflects the needs of Genzyme, an IDA biopharma client in the south east. The institute has also worked extremely hard to develop its research capabilities. An excellent example of this is the telecoms software and systems research group that now has more than 70 researchers. Waterford Institute of Technology has been very helpful in granting the IDA and its supported companies access to department heads to discuss existing and potentially new projects. The number and location of universities in the State is a matter, in the first instance, <Col N="613"/>for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

	<P>On foot of a review of F&Aacute;S employment schemes, which included detailed consultations with the social partners, I decided that with effect from 10 November 2004, the three-year cap would be removed for CE participants aged 55 or over. This category of participants is now eligible to participate on CE for a maximum of six years. The extension of the participation period from three to six years for over 55s should ensure that there will be sufficient clients to fill the available places. I have no plans to make any further changes to CE participation periods. The continuation of ring fencing and prioritisation for the essential services of child care, health related services and drugs task force clients, and the extended participation on CE by older workers, will help to secure the continuity of community services generally.</P>

	<P>No distinction is made in employment rights legislation between Irish and migrant workers. For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employee&rsquo;s (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996. This directive relates to the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and applies also to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus, all employee legislation applies to migrant workers.</P>
        <P>The number of workplace inspections-visits undertaken by the labour inspectorate in the period April to September 2005 was 2,126. Breaches were detected in 306 of those cases. The number of workplace inspections-visits undertaken during the same period in 2004 was 1,947. Breaches were detected in 315 cases. The primary function of the labour inspectorate is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including payment of arrears due to employees. An important measure, therefore, of the effectiveness of the inspectorate is to examine the arrears of pay collected on behalf of employees. During the past six months the recoveries were &euro;247,770, while the recoveries for the period April to September 2004 amounted to &euro;374,380. Earlier this year several key staff members, including three inspectors, were dedicated almost exclusively to one major investigation. As a consequence of that work, and inputs from the Labour Relations Commission and Labour Court, significant adjustments in pay were secured for a number of non-national employees.</P>

	<P>The current upper income limit for eligibility for a back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, BSCFA, for a couple with one child is &euro;368.10 per week. The household income limits under the scheme are indexed each year in line with the contributory old age pension rate in the case of couples, or widow/er contributory <Col N="615"/>pension in the case of lone parent applicants. Applicants are eligible for BSCFA if their household income is not more that &euro;50 above the relevant reference pension rates. The western area of the Health Service Executive, which administers the scheme on my behalf, has advised that it disallowed an application for a BSCFA by the person concerned as her household income was above the limit for eligibility. This household income is derived from a carer&rsquo;s allowance in payment to the person concerned and a disability allowance payable to her husband, amounting to &euro;387.40 in total. The person concerned appealed this decision but the original decision was upheld by the executive&rsquo;s appeals office. I am keeping the qualifying conditions for the BSCFA under review and the particular issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context. Further change in the BSCFA eligibility conditions, apart for the normal indexation, would have to be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

The legislation provides for an exemption from PRSI contributions for up to 52 weeks to be granted to foreign-based employers on behalf of employees not ordinarily resident in the State but who are temporarily employed here. The purpose of the legislation is to avoid a situation whereby workers who are sent by their employer to work here temporarily would be subject to social insurance in two countries at the same time. Similar arrangements apply under EU legislation to workers moving with the EU-EEA and to workers covered by bilateral social security agreements. From 1 January 2005 to 30 September 2005, PRSI exemptions were issued to 351 workers in respect of 24 companies under the scheme. The detailed information requested by the Deputy is being compiled and will be forwarded to him as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>People on employment support schemes such as community employment may qualify for rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Their claims are normally assessed under the standard scheme rules concerning residency, means, housing need and other relevant factors. Under these rules, rent supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of &euro;13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. Where a person has an income in excess of the supplementary welfare allowance rate of payment, up to &euro;60 per week of this additional income can be disregarded for means assessment purposes to help ensure a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. A person who is in receipt of rent supplement and who is considering taking up an offer of a community employment place may continue to receive rent supplement, subject to the standard means test outlined or under special retention arrangements.</P>
        <P>These special arrangements, which have been in place for a number of years, allow people to retain a portion of their rent supplement where they take up work through approved employment support schemes such as community employment, subject to a weekly household income limit of &euro;317.43. A participant in community employment has the option of being assessed under standard rules or using the retention arrangement outlined and will be entitled to receive payment under the more favourable option in his or her situation.</P>
        <P>People in full-time education are excluded normally from receipt of rent supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, people participating in approved courses under the back-to-education allowance scheme receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their previous social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which had been in payment prior to the commencement of their education course. This is subject to the same weekly household income limit of &euro;317.43, which may be relevant if the person pursuing the full-time education course has part-time employment. These special provisions are in place to encourage and facilitate people to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed measures to give effect to the strategies to combat child poverty in Ireland are set out in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and in the national children&rsquo;s strategy. Ending child poverty is also one of ten special initiatives in Sustaining Progress.</P>
        <P>The most significant measure to support families with children in recent years has been the substantial increases in child benefit payment rates. Between 1997 and 2005, the rate of child benefit rose from &euro;38.09 per month for the first two children and &euro;49.52 for each child thereafter to &euro;141.60 per month for each of the first two children and to &euro;177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child. This equates to increases in excess of 170%. Child benefit is paid to more than 540,000 families in respect of approximately 1 million children, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.9 billion in 2005. It delivers a standard rate of payment in respect of all children in a family regardless of income levels or employment status. Providing income support in this way, thus, creates no obstacles to employment and facilitates employment take up by providing significant support with child care costs.</P>
        <P>Through the family income supplement scheme, my Department provides cash support by way of weekly payments to families at work on low pay. Recent improvements to the scheme, including the assessment of entitlements on the basis of net rather than gross income and progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for more lower income households to qualify under the scheme. In a significant proportion of households with children there is no full-time or part-time employment. These households mainly include recipients of the one parent family payment or of payments in respect of disability and unemployment. In other households with larger families, only one parent may be able to take up employment, which results in a lower family income. A study is being carried out by the NESC into the possibility of amalgamating child dependent allowances and family income supplement into a second tier of child income support aimed at families on low incomes.</P>
        <P>A sub-group of the senior officials group on social inclusion has undertaken a detailed examination of obstacles to employment for lone parents. As part of this work, my Department is nearing the completion of a review of income supports and I hope to bring this review to completion in the near future. The provision of affordable and flexible child care is also a key factor in facilitating employment participation for <Col N="618"/>families with children. My Department is participating in an interdepartmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the national children&rsquo;s office. The work of this committee is at an advanced stage and the outcome will make an important contribution to finding the right mix of services and income support to facilitate employment take up and care for children.</P>
        <P>We also need to monitor and evaluate the outcomes of the policies being pursued on the development of our children and get the necessary evidence on what works and works well. This process is about to commence with a major national longitudinal study on children. My Department and the Department of Health and Children, through the national children&rsquo;s office, are jointly funding this study. The study will be the most significant of its kind to be undertaken here, particularly in terms of the cost, scope and length of study period. It is anticipated that 10,000 children from birth and 8,000 children aged nine will be recruited to participate in the study. I am confident that through the measures already being taken and the initiatives being planned, we can make a major contribution to ensuring vulnerable families and their children have a fair share of life chances and quality of life.</P>

The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor. The effect of the restriction is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims. Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. An applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office.</P>
        <P>My Department has kept the operation of the habitual residence condition under review since its introduction. This is to assess the impact of the condition on different categories of claimants, the organisational arrangements and the service provided to customers, to identify opportunities for improvements in the administration of the scheme and identify emerging policy issues and consider how these should be addressed. Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations who have an interest in <Col N="620"/>the area. I expect to draw conclusions by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive, which administers the supplementary welfare scheme on my behalf, is applying the rules relating to rent supplement correctly in this case. Under section 172(1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, people in full-time education are not eligible normally to receive assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, there is a special provision for retention of rent supplement by one-parent family payment and other qualifying social welfare scheme recipients in the specific situation where they resume full-time education after a defined period with the assistance of the back-to-education allowance scheme. People participating in approved courses under this special facility receive a standard weekly rate of payment equivalent to the maximum rate of their relevant social welfare payment and may retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, which may have been in payment prior to participating in the scheme. To qualify for participation in the scheme, people in receipt of one-parent family payment must be aged 21 years or over and in receipt of that payment for six months if accessing the second level option or for 12 months for the third level option. Lone parents and persons in receipt of an unemployment payment aged between 18 and 20 years may also access the scheme if they have been out of formal education for at least two years and in receipt of the relevant social welfare payment for the required period. This programme is designed specifically to give people on unemployment or one-parent family payments for extended periods a second chance to educate themselves to improve their skills and qualifications and to enhance their prospects of returning to the active workforce.</P>
        <P>The scheme is not appropriate to the generality of students who, as in the case of the person con<Col N="621"/>cerned, complete their second level education and continue to third level studies in the normal way. The person concerned has not been out of the education system for two years or more and, therefore, does not qualify for participation in the back-to-education allowance scheme operated by my Department. As a result she is not eligible for rent supplement while she undertakes her third level course. The relevant State support mechanism in such cases is annual third level maintenance grants scheme to assist people from lower income households towards their living costs while undertaking college courses.</P>

	<P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance, BSCFA, which is administered on my behalf by the Health Service Executive, provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. An allowance of &euro;80 is payable in respect of qualified children aged between two and 11 years or &euro;150 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years. Applications may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year. A person may qualify for payment of a BSCFA if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course and has household income at or below certain specified levels.</P><Col N="622"/>
        <P>Income limits for eligibility under the scheme have been increased regularly, along with general rate increases. These increases in underlying social welfare rates and in the corresponding household income limits for BSCFA purposes have considerably exceeded the rate of price change in clothing and footwear in recent times and have also helped to bring additional people on low incomes into eligibility under the scheme. An additional increase in the income limits or increases in the payment rates have budgetary implications and can only be considered in this context.</P>

	<P>The back-to-education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active workforce. I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme to 12 months &mdash; 312 days &mdash; in the last budget. I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from &euro;254 to &euro;400. These changes came into effect from 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>Following an undertaking to the D&aacute;il and the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I have further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to nine months &mdash; 234 days. This condition will apply to persons who are participating in the national employment action plan, NEAP, process and where a F&Aacute;S employment services officer recommends pursuance of a third level course as essential to the enhancement of the individuals employment prospects. This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005.</P>
        <P>The person concerned does not meet the qualifying period requirement and does not, therefore, satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme, as only 166 days of paid unemployment were accumulated to the time the course of study started. This is well short of the required 312 days in this person&rsquo;s case.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders in receipt of long-term social welfare or health service executive payments towards their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are not payable in cases where a person has access to his or her own fuel supply or is benefiting from a subsidised heating service such as that provided by Dublin City Council at a number of its housing complexes. This has been the policy since the inception of the scheme.</P>
        <P>In the particular case raised by the Deputy, total heating needs are met at a cost to the tenant of less than &euro;6 per week over the full year. In the course of a routine review of fuel allowance payments, the Department recently ceased fuel allowance entitlement which had been paid in error in a number of cases where recipients were in local authority accommodation with subsidised heating. The allowances were withdrawn in these cases. A change to the existing arrangements in respect of the fuel allowance for this group would have quite significant cost implications and would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in the light of the resources available to me for improvements in social welfare generally.</P>

	<P>For the purposes of most other social welfare payments, entitlement to an increase for a qualified adult is based on the income of the spouse or partner.

People with a primary degree are already in possession of a third level qualification and their academic qualifications impact positively on their employment prospects. Furthermore, the scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering the third level education system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 285 together.</P>
        <P>The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department. A key objective of my Department&rsquo;s control strategy is to ensure that we pay the right person the right amount of money at the right time. A four-pronged approach has been adopted by the Department to meet this objective, namely prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments. Systematic risk analysis is a key element of the control strategy. This entails the identification, by scheme managers, of areas of high risk of fraud and abuse in the schemes for which they are responsible and putting in place appropriate measures to address them in a systematic way. The purpose of this approach is to ensure review activity is targeted in the most effective manner.</P>
        <P>During 2004 and 2005 my Department undertook a number of specific control initiatives in its regions throughout the country, the outcomes of which are being evaluated with a view to expanding successful initiatives to other areas. These initiatives will feed into the process of refocusing control activity to those areas and types of cases which present the highest risk of fraud and error. My Department also includes surveys of <Col N="627"/>the levels of fraud and error as part of its control strategy to identify the types of claims, which should be prioritised for review purposes. As an integral part of its control strategy, my Department is committed to undertaking at least two surveys annually to establish the levels of fraud and error arising. Controls are also exercised at the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. More than 600 staff members at local, regional and national level are engaged on a full or part-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.</P>
        <P>During 2004 306,000 reviews of entitlement were carried out by staff in my Department. The records of 6,600 employers were inspected to ensure compliance with the Department&rsquo;s regulations and in particular to prevent and detect abuses of the system. In 2005, to the end of August, more than 211,000 claim reviews have been undertaken and 3,600 employers inspected. In 2004, as a result of control activity, my Department realised total savings of &euro;386 million in combating fraud and abuse. In 2005, to the end of August, savings of more than &euro;265 million have also been realised. The total amount of overpayments set up as a result of detected fraud or suspected fraud during 2004 was &euro;18.63 million. In 2005, to the end of August, overpayments totalling &euro;12.26 million were set up as a result of detected or suspected fraud.</P>
        <P>The prosecution of offenders is a key element in my Department&rsquo;s overall control approach. My Department&rsquo;s policy is to consider all cases of fraud for prosecution. During 2004, 503 cases were referred to the State solicitor&rsquo;s office to initiate prosecution proceedings. A total of 284 cases were finalised in court, of which ten defendants were served with prison sentences, 26 received suspended sentences, 159 were fined and 44 received the benefit of the Probation Act. The remaining penalties included cases which received community service or were bound to the peace. In 2005 to the end of August, 287 cases have been submitted for initiation of court proceedings. I am committed to ensuring social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them. I am also determined to ensure abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected. In this regard the control programme of my Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continually refined to ensure they remain effective.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 287 together.</P>
        <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to 10,000 invalid PPS numbers rather than bogus numbers. Ongoing work to improve the integrity of the data on the Department&rsquo;s central records system database initially uncovered these invalid numbers. These PPS numbers were mainly old numbers on the database and were incorrectly technically formatted. These have since been corrected.</P>
        <P>My Department is acutely aware of the importance of the PPS number and of the data on its central records system. Since taking over responsibility in 2000 for the issue of PPS numbers, my Department has put in place a range of measures to strengthen the registration process through improved procedures and controls including face-to-face interviews at local and branch offices. Further improvements in identity fraud controls will be developed having regard to developments in the area of identity management policies generally. The specific issues raised in the report are being addressed and will be considered by the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of its examination of the report.</P>

	<P>The current computer system to record overpayments and overpayment recoveries has been in place since the mid-1980s. It is a stand-alone system which requires a high degree of manual input. There is a major project in place to replace the current computer system with a new overpayments and debt management system. It is intended that this new computer system will better support my Department&rsquo;s statutory recording and reporting function for overpayments and overpayment recoveries as well as provide a comprehensive debt management function. The requirements of the new overpayments and debt management computer system have <Col N="629"/>been specified and the new system is due to go live during 2006.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders on long-term social welfare payments with meeting the cost of their additional heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from the end of September to mid-April and are not intended to meet the full cost of heating. Some 274,000 customers, 151,000 with basic fuel allowance and 123,000 with smokeless fuel supplement, benefit under the scheme at a cost of &euro;85.4 million in 2005.</P>
        <P>Under the scheme, a fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week is paid to eligible households during this 29 week winter heating period, with an additional &euro;3.90 per week payable in the designated urban smokeless fuel zones. These rates were increased to these levels in January 2002. The position is being kept under review.</P>
        <P>According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the overall consumer price index has increased by 11.8% from the start of 2002 to August 2005. The price of solid fuels has increased by 15.2% in this period. An increase in <Col N="631"/>the fuel allowance rates to match solid fuel price inflation since 2002 would bring its rate to about &euro;10.40 or &euro;14.90 in smokeless fuel areas. It is estimated that such an increase would cost of the order of &euro;13 million extra in a full year.</P>
        <P>While not increasing the value of fuel allowances which are payable for only part of the year, Government policy has been to increase primary payment rates by amounts well in excess of inflation. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances but it delivers a better outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their real income over the whole year.</P>
        <P>Pensioners and other eligible groups have received cumulative increases of between 33.6% and 37.3% in their primary social welfare payment rates since 2002. These higher rates of primary payments are payable over 52 weeks of the year and have improved the income situation of welfare recipients considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. For example, a single person on a contributory old age pension has received an increase of &euro;32 per week over the last three budgets when fuel allowances were held constant. This is approximately double the amount required to compensate for all the inflation, including fuel price inflation.</P>
        <P>In addition to fuel allowance, more than 300,000 pensioners and their households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>

	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health service executive payments towards their additional heating needs during the winter season. About 274,000 households receive a fuel allowance, at an expected cost of &euro;85.4 million this year. In addition to fuel allowance, more than 300,000 pensioners and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits pack<Col N="632"/>age payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year at an overall cost of &euro;108.8 million in 2005. There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.</P>
        <P>Pensioners and other social welfare groups have received significant increases in their welfare payment rates this year and in recent years. This has improved their income situation considerably in real terms relative to solid fuel cost increases and to price inflation generally. These higher rates of primary payments are payable over 52 weeks of the year.</P>
        <P>People on a qualifying non-contributory pension or other social welfare payment are normally eligible for a fuel allowance without further means test, subject to the other conditions for entitlement. Other applicant households may have a combined income of up to &euro;51 above the current maximum weekly contributory old age pension rate and still qualify for a fuel allowance. Based on this formula, the current upper limit income for fuel allowance eligibility is &euro;230.80 for a single applicant or &euro;349.80 for a couple, with further additions if there are any qualified dependent children or if the applicant is over 80 years of age.</P>
        <P>This fuel allowance income limit increases each winter season in line with the reference rate of old age contributory pension. On this basis, there have been significant real increases in the income limits for fuel allowance applicants in recent years. This situation will continue in future winter heating seasons, in line with prevailing pension rates. The question of any additional increase in the income limit would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

        <Quest>the number of persons who are in receipt of both the disability benefit and the blind pension; the estimated cost to the Exchequer for extending both payments beyond the age of 66 years in view of the financial hardship that arises for recipients when they reach pension age; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The qualifying conditions for the payment of disability benefit are that a person is under 66 years of age, unfit for work due to illness and satisfies the PRSI contribution conditions. Persons over the age of 66 are not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts for disability benefit purposes and the age limit for receipt of <Col N="633"/>disability benefit is 66 years. There are 62,964 persons in receipt of disability benefits.</P>
        <P>Blind pension is payable beyond 66 years of age, when the maximum personal rate increases from &euro;148.80 per week to a maximum rate of &euro;166.00 per week, with increases for qualified adults and-or dependent children. There are 1,982 persons in receipt of blind pensions.</P>
        <P>A person in receipt of a blind pension aged less than 66 years who has sufficient PRSI contributions may also be eligible to receive disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit, or health and safety benefit. Alternatively, they may concurrently receive widow or widower&rsquo;s pension or one parent family payment. However, once a person reaches 66 years of age, only one payment may be made. There are 205 people in receipt of disability benefits and blind pensions, ten of whom are 65 years of age. The annual cost of extending payment of disability benefit to those recipients beyond 65 years would be approximately &euro;90,000.</P>
        <P>Any changes to entitlements would, however, have wider implications as there are other categories of social welfare recipients who also have entitlement to more than one income maintenance payment at any one time, including people in receipt of widow&rsquo;s or widower&rsquo;s pension and one-parent family payment. Changes to entitlements would have to be considered in the context of the wider budgetary package.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The over-80 allowance is an additional payment of &euro;6.40 per week made to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. At present, just over 100,000 people are receiving the allowance which was last increased in 1996.</P>
        <P>However, for many years the policy with regard to support for pensioners has been to commit resources to improving the personal pension rates for all pensioners, rather than supplementary payments such as the over-80 allowance. In this way, resources are used to give the maximum possible benefit to all pensioners. Since 1997, the personal rate of pensions has increased by up to 81%. The increase in prices over the same period is 30.7%. Future policy in terms of allowances such as the over-80 allowance will be considered in a budgetary context.</P><Col N="634"/>
        <P>The allowance represented about 6.6% of the personal rate for old age contributory pensioners. Had the allowance kept pace with the increase in pensions since then it would now be worth approximately &euro;12 per week.</P>

	<P>The technical standards for the fitting of safety belts and restraint systems in new vehicles at European level, which are set down in a number of EU type approval directives, do not make specific provision for safety belts in school buses. At present, these standards are not obligatory for a number of classes of motor vehicles, including large buses. Following a decision by the European Parliament in May 2005, the way is now clear for the Council of Ministers to adopt as directives proposed measures that would make the existing technical standards mandatory in all new buses, including school buses, entering into service from a date yet to be settled. There are no requirements under the existing or proposed directives for safety belts to be retrofitted in existing vehicles.</P>
        <P>A member state considering a retrofit programme in existing vehicles will need to adopt a retrofit specification as consistent as practicable <Col N="635"/>with the EU standards for new vehicles. In general terms, these standards provide for the fitment of three-point belts in exposed seats and either three-point or lap belts in other seats.</P>
        <P>It was against this background that the working group, which was established in June 2005 to progress measures to enhance school bus safety following the Kentstown bus accident, considered how best to arrive at a situation where all buses participating in the school transport scheme are fitted with safety belts. The feasibility of retrofitting safety belts in existing school buses was considered by the working group, which consulted national experts in a number of EU countries as well as the European Commission on the matter.</P>
        <P>On the basis of observed international practice and the EU standards referred to above and notwithstanding the contrary view adopted by certain countries outside the EU, the working group was of the view that lap belts, with associated safety measures, were most appropriate for installation in a retrofit situation in school buses. The associated safety measures include, for instance, the use of energy absorbing material on the backs and tops of seats. The view of the working group on this matter informed the decision of the Government that all vehicles used in the school <Col N="636"/>transport scheme will be equipped with safety belts by December 2006.</P>

	<P>As I indicated in reply to Questions Nos. 774, 824, 778 and 781 of 28 September 2005, all vehicles using public roads are required by law to comply with a range of standards in respect of their construction, equipment, use, weights and dimensions. The requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 and the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004. These regulations apply in the interests of public safety and to protect road infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Regulation 59 of the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 provides for the issuing of special permits by local authorities for the use of vehicles on roads notwithstanding that they contravene certain provisions of the aforementioned regulations. Specifically, the special permit system is intended to deal with vehicles carrying abnormal and indivisible loads. The function is assigned to local authorities because they are best placed to assess the suitability of the roads in their functional areas for use by non-compliant vehicles and to determine the appropriate routes and itineraries to be used in the making of journeys by such vehicles. A special permit issued by a local authority may cover one or more vehicles and have a validity of up to 12 months&rsquo; duration. I have no plans for my Department to take on the function of issuing special permits. However, in particular circumstances, a single special permit system handled by one body has merit and I have held some discussions on this subject. I will ask my Department to explore how best to proceed.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Passenger services on the Sandyford to St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and the Tallaght to Connolly Station lines are operating to wide public acclaim. In 2005, Luas is on course to carry nearly 21 million passengers. This is substantially ahead of projected passenger numbers. Recent customer surveys conducted by Connex indicate that passenger satisfaction with the Luas service is very high across all aspects of the service provided. In particular, very strong satisfaction levels were recorded in terms of journey times, punctuality and reliability of the service.</P><Col N="638"/>
        <P>It appears that a significant proportion of Luas users had formerly used private vehicles. Apart from car transfers, there also appears to be a significant number of new trips to the city centre for business and-or recreation. This view is shared by city centre businesses which report substantial increases in business as a result of Luas and is reflected in the high levels of Luas usage in the traditional off-peak periods and at weekends. Overall, Luas has been a major success story and is a valued and valuable addition to the public transport system in Dublin. Further development of the Luas network is being considered in context of the ten-year transport investment framework, which my Department is preparing.</P>

	<P>Waterways Ireland, a North-South implementation body, has responsibility for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes. The body has informed me that the footbridge in question consists of a number of timber pallets placed at a location on the bed of the Royal <Col N="642"/>Canal, Longford branch. This timber crossing was constructed by a third party as a short cut across the canal since the canal was closed. I understand that Waterways Ireland has no plans to install a footbridge at this location.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware in general terms of the statement made by the outgoing chairman of the Tallaght drugs task force. I acknowledge that increased use of cocaine, in powder and more particularly in crack form, would present very serious challenges to drugs services. As the Deputy will be aware, there is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services such as counselling and behavioural therapy are the best treatments available.</P>
        <P>In this context, it should be noted that the health services have recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years. The issue of increased poly-drug use, including cocaine, was also examined in the context of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy and one of the key recommendations arising from the review is that increased priority be given to the availability and range of treatment options.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that late last year, I approved funding of almost &euro;400,000 for a number of pilot cocaine projects which are being rolled out in selected local drugs task force areas, including Tallaght. The project in question is being developed through the community addiction response project, CARP, Killinarden, and St. Dominic&rsquo;s.</P><Col N="643"/>
        <P>The Government will continue to monitor this situation very closely. In this regard, I am meeting representatives of the Garda national drugs unit in the near future to discuss this and other relevant issues.</P>

        <P>My Department, supported by Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is a matter for each of the other Departments to report on progress on their implementation of RAPID and details of funding for the proposals that fall within their remit. As regards my Department, RAPID falls to be considered under the community development programme, funding for local drugs task forces, LDTF, the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund, YPFSF, the RAPID leverage fund and administrative supports for RAPID.</P>
        <P>On community development projects, there are also more than 110 CDP projects in RAPID areas that have received just over &euro;10.6 million in 2004 and a further &euro;12.1 million in 2005 in funding from my Department. Ten new community development projects in RAPID areas were prioritised since the commencement of the programme. Projects in Bluebell, Drimnagh, Dolphin House, Gurranabrahar, Inchicore, Loughlinstown, Merchants Quay-Ushers Quay, Shanganagh-Rathsallagh, Longford town and Tipperary have each received renewable contracts to the end of 2006 with current funding set at &euro;60,000 per annum each.</P>
        <P>On drugs, my Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces and ten regional drugs task forces. The local drugs task forces were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin, and many of them have RAPID areas within them. Over &euro;95 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their two rounds of local action plans. A further &euro;13.6 million has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.8-?>
        <P>The total spend from subhead N in 2004, the majority of which was allocated to LDTF areas, was &euro;27.510 million and the allocation available in the current year is &euro;30.5 million. In addition, approximately &euro;85 million has been allocated to support the work of the young people&rsquo;s facilities and services fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres. The main aim of the fund is to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. RAPID communities located in these areas would, of course, benefit from this funding.</P>
        <P>Money is also spent under the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, in RAPID areas. As the border of LDSIP partnerships are not co-terminous with those of RAPID areas, it is not possible to quantify the exact spend in RAPID areas.</P>
        <P>In 2004, I launched the RAPID leverage fund and &euro;4.5 million was ring-fenced to progress small-scale localised actions in RAPID areas through co-funding with the relevant Department or agency. Details of the 2004 co-funded schemes are as follows: local authority housing estate enhancement scheme 2004 &mdash; funding totalling &euro;2 million allocated by my Department and the local authorities; RAPID playgrounds scheme 2004 &mdash; funding totalling &euro;3 million allocated by my Department and the Department of Health and Children; top-up funding under the sports capital programme 2004 &mdash; my Department allocated top-up funding of &euro;2.2 million to successful projects under the sports capital programme in RAPID areas; and co-fund between my Department and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform 2004 &mdash; funding totalling &euro;351,000 for small-scale projects, IT equipment and minibuses.</P>
        <P>In 2005, &euro;7.5 million funding is available to my Department for RAPID leverage and the following schemes for RAPID areas have been launched: local authority housing estate enhancement scheme 2005-2006 &mdash; total funding &euro;4.5 million with &euro;100,000 allocated to each RAPID area, co-funded with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through the local authorities; RAPID health sector co-fund &mdash; a total of &euro;4.6 million has been allocated to support small-scale health and community projects, co-funded by the Department of Health and Children through the Health Service Executive; traffic measures co-fund &mdash; total funding &euro;2.025 million, a total of &euro;45,000 allocated to each RAPID area, co-funded with the local authorities; playgrounds grants scheme 2005 &mdash; total funding &euro;3 million, a total of &euro;66,000 has been allocated to each RAPID area to develop-refurbish playgrounds in RAPID areas, co-funded with the Department of Health and Children <Col N="646"/>through the Health Service Executive; additional funding for RAPID community-based CCTV &mdash; the community based CCTV scheme was launched by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with successful applicants from RAPID areas receiving additional funding towards the capital cost of the scheme from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>Special provision was also made for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. RAPID, CL&Aacute;R and LDTF areas have benefited from just over &euro;38.4 million in funding allocations over 2004 and 2005.</P>
        <P>On administrative supports, since the establishment of the RAPID programme, my Department has provided approximately &euro;6.333 million by way of support to the local areas in the preparation and implementation of their plans and administration costs associated with the support team in ADM.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 320, 331, 333 and 334 together.</P>
        <P>In September, Glanbia plc announced the closure of its Kilmeaden cheese factory, with the loss of four full-time and 41 seasonal jobs. Cheese production will now be consolidated into Glanbia&rsquo;s Ballyragget plant and in line with an agreement between Glanbia and Dairygold, some milk will also be sent to Dairygold&rsquo;s Mitchelstown site for contract manufacturing. Glanbia will continue to collect milk as normal from its Waterford milk suppliers with no additional cost or inconvenience.</P>
        <P>Closure of the seasonally operated Kilmeaden factory was a commercial decision taken by the company itself and was due primarily to increasing costs and the need for greater capacity utilisation within Glanbia&rsquo;s cheddar cheese manufacturing process. Glanbia is retaining the Kilmeaden site and is actively considering alternative options best suited for the production of small volume, niche dairy or other products.</P>
        <P>I have been assured that the combined efforts of the various agencies engaged in overseeing and co-ordinating the industrial needs of the Waterford area will deliver future employment opportunities in the Waterford region.</P>

The query on one of the parcels in question has been resolved. Both claimants have been written to to clarify the matter in relation to the second parcel. While a reply was received on behalf of the applicant on 10 October 2005, my Department has now requested confirmation of ownership of the lands in question. Until this matter is resolved my Department is not in a position to finalise the processing of the application from the person named.</P>

	<P>Compliance with good farming practice is an obligation for farmers participating in the following schemes: compensatory allowances, installation aid, the on-farm investment schemes, REPS and the scheme of early retirement from farming, in which it applies to transferees. Compliance with good farming practice is one of the undertakings checked in the course of on-farm inspections relating to these schemes carried out by my Department.</P>
        <P>Good farming practice was also obligatory in the past for participants in the arable aid and animal premium schemes which have now been replaced by the single payment scheme. As part of cross-compliance under the single payment scheme, farmers must comply with the requirements of the nitrates directive. The implementation of the directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has recently published draft regulations to give effect to the national action programme under the nitrates directive. These draft regulations, which are the subject of a consultative process, include controls on the use of animal manure.</P>

Following a full review of the circumstances outlined, the appeals committee recommended that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.</P>
        <P>The <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances provisions of the single payment regulations allow for the exclusion of a year or years from the 2000 to 2002 reference period from the calculation of the single payment entitlements where production in any reference year was clearly affected by a case of <i>force majeure</i> or exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>My Department is satisfied that the person named suffered serious health problems in October 2001. However, production remained relatively constant throughout the reference period and the exclusion of a year or years would not impact significantly on the amount of his single payment.

	<P>The person named submitted four applications in respect of a total of 49 animals under the 2004 special beef premium scheme. As <Col N="650"/>animal passports were not submitted in respect of seven animals, only 42 animals were potentially eligible for payment. Following computer validation of these applications, it was found that seven animals were not recorded on the CMMS database as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application for the scheme. Under the rules of the scheme, it was appropriate that these animals be rejected, that is, not paid premium and a reduction penalty applied to any payments due in respect of other applications. Given the level of non-compliance, no payment was due to the person named under the 2004 scheme.</P>
        <P>However, having reviewed the circumstances of the case, the person named is being contacted directly by an official of my Department to clarify certain aspects which, if they can be satisfactorily resolved, would allow payment to be made.</P>
        <P>The person named has submitted an application for consideration in respect of the inheritance measure of the single payment scheme after the 2000 and 2002 reference period.

	<P>I have not taken a decision on the future of the early retirement scheme. The European Council regulation covering the current scheme will expire in December 2006. The Council regulation on rural development for the period from 2007 to 2013 again includes provision for member states to operate early retirement measures. No decisions have yet been taken regarding the schemes to be operated in Ireland under this regulation.</P>
        <P>The early retirement scheme was introduced as one of a number of instruments to improve the age structure of Irish farming and improve the viability of farm holdings. From that point of view, the first scheme from 1994 to 1999 was not unsuccessful. However, take-up of the current scheme has fallen short of expectations, and an expenditure review carried out in my Department in 2004 raised a number of questions about the effectiveness of the scheme in achieving its objectives. Structural reform is still a priority both at home and at European level, and we still need to provide opportunities for young farmers. In framing proposals for the next rural development round we need to consider how best to achieve those results in the light of the funding and the options that are available.</P>
        <P>Details of the number of participants who entered the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming, which closed to new applicants on 31 December 1999, and the current scheme introduced in November 2000, are set out in the table <Col N="652"/>below for each of the years 1994 to 2005.

Following receipt of the genotype results, the tagging arrangements employed were in accordance with the tagging regime used for all positive flocks.

	<P>The single payment scheme project will deliver computer systems to deal with all aspects of the single payment and the disadvantaged area scheme, including land information, the establishment and trading of entitlements, cross compliance and payments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department opted for the earliest implementation date allowable. Details of the relevant regulations have been subject to ongoing negotiation. Consequently, this project has been phased to ensure that the various elements of the system have been available at the various stages as required. This is being done to an extremely tight deadline. The overall project is running to schedule. Fully decoupled payments are expected to commence on 1 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The development of systems for calculation of individual entitlements and creation of the national database of entitlements was completed, culminating in the issue of provisional entitlements to farmers earlier this year. The system to manage the process of annual claims for the single payment is under development and will be ready to issue payments to farmers in December.</P>
        <P>It will be necessary to build further systems in 2006 to facilitate trading of single payment <Col N="654"/>entitlements, and to implement additional EU cross-compliance requirements. The external costs to date are under &euro;4 million. The costs of the systems to be built in 2006 are still the subject of negotiation. The future maintenance costs of the system will be dictated by the level of functionality required, as further regulations are implemented. The systems extensively re-use work already carried out on the iMAP system, developed for the premia &mdash; disadvantaged area schemes. This has greatly reduced the cost. These systems will support annual payments of approximately &euro;1.5 billion.</P>

	<P>The person concerned, a Nigerian national, arrived in the State on 21 May 1997 and applied for asylum. His claim for refugee status was considered under the process then applicable and was refused by the asylum division of my Department. He was notified of the decision on 12 March 1999 and again on 1 June 1999. He appealed this decision to the appropriate body at the time, the appeals authority, which affirmed the decision of the asylum division. He was notified of this decision on 31 July 2002.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was informed on 20 September 2002 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. In accordance with the Act, he was given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons why he should not be deported namely, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the deportation order was made; or consenting to the making of the deportation order. Representations setting out reasons why he should not be deported were subsequently received.</P>
        <P>I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision. This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These considerations include matters relating to the common good, the person&rsquo;s family and domestic circumstances, as well as humanitarian considerations. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition of refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>An extensive set of criteria applies when assessing any visa application. These criteria, to a large extent, depend on the context in which the application is made, the personal circumstances of the applicant, and the nature and purpose of the application itself. Government policy of the day will also have an influence on the assessment of applications falling into specific categories.</P>
        <P>The onus rests with the applicant to provide evidence of actual ties with their country of origin, which may be ties of an economic, social, personal or professional nature. Such ties are factors which may be taken into consideration when examining an application for a visa. An applicant for a visit visa seeks to enter the State for a short period only and must clearly demonstrate that he or she will adhere to the conditions of the visa.</P>
        <P>The visa applications in question were received in my Department on 27 July 2005 and were refused on 28 August 2005. The applications were the subject of an appeal by the applicants at which time additional information was supplied to my Department addressing the reason for refusal. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned and the decision to decline the grant of a visa was upheld. As each application is entitled to only one appeal, no further review can be facilitated.</P>

	<P>Section 8 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that a non-national who is married to an Irish citizen, who is Irish other than by naturalisation, post-nuptial citizenship or honorary citizenship, for a period of at least three years, may lodge a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as post-nuptial citizenship. The marriage must be subsisting at the date of lodgement of the declaration. Furthermore, the couple must be living together as husband and wife and the Irish spouse must submit an affidavit to that effect when the declaration is being lodged.</P>
        <P>The continued availability of this process is finite because it was repealed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001. However, it remains open to non-nationals who married prior to 30 November 2002 and who fulfil the statutory conditions of three years&rsquo; marriage etc. This window of opportunity will cease with effect from 29 November 2005. Persons who marry on or after 30 November 2002, or persons who married prior to that date but do not avail of the post-nuptial process prior to 29 November 2005, must apply for naturalisation.</P>
        <P>The table shows the number of declarations of post-nuptial citizenship received and certificates of citizenship issued on foot of such declarations in the last five years.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The processing time for such declarations is between ten and 12 months at the present time. The main reason for this is the increase in the volume of declarations being received over the last few years. The ending of the scheme on 29 November 2005 is likely to have contributed to this increase in that persons who, but for the ending of the scheme may not have lodged declarations, have decided to do so.</P>
        <P>The number of declarations received and certificates issued in the whole of 2001 was surpassed in the first six months of 2005. This can be attributed to an ongoing streamlining of procedures coupled with the assignment of additional staff to the citizenship section in recent months.</P>
        <P>In respect of persons awaiting the finalisation of consideration of their declarations and who wish to travel outside of Ireland, the position is <Col N="662"/>that if they are visa-required nationals, they can apply to the Department of Foreign Affairs for re-entry visas prior to their departure from the State.</P>
        <P>Matters related to non-nationals working in the State are appropriate to be dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

	<P>The Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks and, under the Act, any person wishing to import fireworks into the State must first obtain an importation licence from me. It is long-standing policy to grant importation licences only for organised fireworks displays conducted by professional and experienced operators and not to allow the importation of fireworks for sale to the general public.</P>
        <P>Last February, I published a fireworks policy consultation document and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document which are being examined.</P>
        <P>It is already clear, from the submissions received, that, among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the House, to bring forward, on Committee Stage of that Bill, amendments that will provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to increase significantly penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 351 and 352 together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the national steering committee on violence against women, or NSC, which is chaired by a Minister of State in my Department, was established in 1997 following the publication of the report of the task force on violence against women. A wide range of relevant non-governmental organisations are represented on the committee, along with the key State bodies with a role in this field. The committee&rsquo;s remit is to provide a forum for the co-ordination of responses to violence against women, and a great deal has been achieved since its inception.</P>
        <P>Earlier this year my Department, in conjunction with the NSC, commissioned the preparation of a new strategic plan for the committee to guide its work over the next five to ten years, taking into account the recommendations contained in the task force report and the progress achieved to date, as well as issues which have arisen since the publication of the report. That project has involved extensive consultation with interested parties, as well as an evaluation of the working methods and structures of the committee, with a view to enhancing their effectiveness further. The strategic plan is expected to be completed early next year and will be broadly disseminated in advance of implementation.</P>

        <P>Local Garda management reports that garda&iacute; allocated to Aughrim Garda station make use of the patrol car attached to Avoca Garda station.

	<P>Clonmel is one of 17 locations nationwide to be selected to receive a Garda CCTV system. This programme of installing CCTV systems is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1 &mdash; Bray, Dundalk, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 &mdash; Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; phase 3 &mdash; Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. Phase 1 has been completed in five of the six locations.</P>
        <P>Installation of CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. I have asked the Commissioner to submit proposals for outsourced CCTV systems in the 11 locations in the remaining two phases with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations, including Clonmel, by the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>As a first step in that process, the Garda authorities engaged a consultancy firm to examine all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV systems, including the installation, operation and management of CCTV systems; monitoring, recording and related activities; accommodation and situation of facilities and staff regarding the town CCTV system and Garda station premises; and assessment of the civilianisation of Garda CCTV monitoring conducted under the management of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The consultancy firm also examined which procurement model is the most suitable regarding commercial viability and cost-effectiveness for the provision of town-centre CCTV systems. That <Col N="666"/>consultancy process has recently concluded, and the Garda authorities are now finalising their proposals in consultation with my Department.</P>

	<P>I am satisfied that the terms of reference of the inquiry which I have appointed Mr. Hugh Hartnett SC to hold into the arrest, detention and treatment of Brian Rossiter and the investigation of his death will enable the facts surrounding this regrettable incident to be ascertained in a thorough and speedy manner.</P>
        <P>I am also satisfied that on the basis of legal advice received, with which I concur, section 12 of the Dublin Police Act 1924, as amended, provides an adequate mechanism for the inquiry. That section gives Mr. Hartnett powers to summon witnesses and examine them on oath.</P>
        <P>While the manner in which the inquiry is to be held is a matter for Mr. Hartnett, he has indicated to me that it will not be held in public. However, I intend to publish his report when I have received it from him.

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware, the community-based group in question submitted an application for capital grant assistance to my Department in February 2005. The application was forwarded immediately to Area Development Management Limited, or ADM, which is engaged by my Department to carry out the day-to-day administration of the equal opportunities child care programme from 2000 to 2006, EOCP, including detailed assessments of all EOCP grant applications. Each application undergoes a thorough assessment by ADM to ensure that it meets the EOCP funding criteria.</P>
        <P>I understand from inquiries that I have made that ADM has been in dialogue with the group and received correspondence from it clarifying certain outstanding issues. Following the assessment, the application for capital grant assistance will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, or PAC, which is chaired by my Department, before a decision is made regarding funding.</P>
        <P>The group in question was awarded staffing grant assistance under the EOCP of &euro;12,000 for one year in March 2003. That funding was approved to allow the group to submit a development plan for the service and to progress its capital grant application.</P>
        <P>An application for further staffing grant assistance was considered by the PAC in March 2005. Having considered the application in the light of all information made available, the PAC did not <Col N="668"/>recommend that the project should continue to be funded under the staffing measure of the EOCP. The group offers a limited service of one session per day, which has not expanded since the original staffing grant was approved. As a result, it was considered that the group had not sufficiently addressed the conditions attached to its initial staffing grant or moved towards fully meeting the objectives of the EOCP.</P>
        <P>An appeal regarding that staffing grant was received in June 2005 and forwarded to ADM for assessment. I understand that the appeal is in the final stages of the appraisal process. On completion of that process, a decision will be made by my Department and communicated to the group at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <P>When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer will consider, among other factors, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. In that regard, the criteria set by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility for family income supplement payment, or FIS, are used &mdash; the criteria, which may change from time to time, are available on that Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.welfare.ie/publications/sw22.html</i>. If the level of the worker&rsquo;s income as evidenced by his or her payslips or P60 would qualify for FIS payments, the application for a visa is generally refused. The visa officer will expect to see sufficient evidence of the financial status of the applicant in the form of several payslips and detailed bank statements covering, at a minimum, a two- to three-month period. The documentation supplied should demonstrate a consistent financial history and evidence of regular income.</P>
        <P>The application was the subject of an appeal by the applicant, at which time additional information was supplied to my Department in an effort to address the reasons for refusal. However, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude, based on the additional information supplied, that the initial decision should be overturned, and consequently the decision to decline the grant of a visa was upheld.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>As each application is entitled to only one appeal, no further review can be facilitated.</P>

	<P>It is not the practice to comment in detail on individual asylum applications.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, applications for refugee status in the State are determined by an independent process comprising the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the refugee appeals tribunal, which make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as to whether such status should be granted.</P>
        <P>A final decision on this application will be made upon receipt of the decision of the refugee appeals tribunal.</P>

	<P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department, through the Probation and Welfare Service, has provided current funding to the <Col N="670"/>Ballymun youth action project since 1989. Current funding of &euro;66,700 was advanced to the project in 2004, and a similar grant has been paid in the current year.</P>
        <P>As part of the regeneration of Ballymun, the tower block which housed the project was demolished. The future plan for the project is that it will occupy a unit in a new multi-purpose, multi-agency community support centre in Ballymun.</P>
        <P>An application from the project, in December 2004, for a capital grant of &euro;150,000 was submitted to my Department through the Probation and Welfare Service. As it is not the norm in my Department to provide capital grants for the purchase or development of premises which I, as Minister, do not own or lease, capital funding was not sanctioned.</P>
        <P>It is, however, my intention to provide current funding to the project to continue its valuable <Col N="671"/>work with drug-abusing offenders in the Ballymun area.</P>

	<P>Applications from the couple concerned for leave to remain in Ireland under the revised scheme announced by me on 15 January 2005 for the non-national parents of Irish-born children born before 1 January 2005 were approved on 23 June 2005.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, all applicants are obliged to submit several identity documents, including the birth certificate of the Irish-born child, to provide a complete application. In each case, the Department retains on file the birth certificate of the Irish-born child. Other documents are usually returned to the applicants. The specific documents requested were returned to the applicants earlier this month.</P>

	<P>The visa applications in question were received in my Department on 15 August 2005.</P>
        <P>An extensive set of criteria is applied when assessing any visa application. Those criteria, to a large extent, depend on the context in which the application is made, the personal circumstances of the applicant, and the nature and purpose of the application itself. Government policy of the day will also have an influence on the assessment of applications falling into specific categories.</P>
        <P>The onus rests on the applicant to provide evidence of actual ties with his or her country of origin, which may be ties of an economic, social, personal or professional nature. Such ties, or the apparent lack thereof, are factors which may be taken into consideration when examining an application for a visa. An applicant for a visit visa seeks to enter the state for a short period only and must clearly demonstrate that he or she will adhere to the conditions of the visa applied for. In this, case, the visa officer was unable to conclude, based on the information supplied, that the applicants would necessarily observe the conditions of the visa, were it to be issued. The applications were therefore refused on 26 September 2005.</P><Col N="674"/>
        <P>There is no record of any appeal having been received in these cases. In the event that an appeal is lodged, the applications shall be fully reconsidered, taking into account any additional information and documentation received.</P>

	<P>I currently have no plans to increase the retirement age for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were recruited to the force prior to 1 April 2004.</P>
        <P>The changes in the retirement age for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outlined in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 will apply only to new entrants recruited to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na after 1 April 2004.</P>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is being increased to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government commitment in that regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its imple<Col N="675"/>mentation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>To reach this record force strength a campaign was launched in November last year to recruit 1,100 Garda recruits each year from 2005 to 2007, inclusive. I might add that this accelerated recruitment campaign is fully on target and will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of 2006.</P>

The Deputy should also note that the Civil Legal Aid Act requires that the board&rsquo;s accounts be submitted for audit to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that the report of that audit be laid before the Oireachtas. As the report and the associated financial statements of the board form an integral part of the annual report, finalisation of the document in any given year is dependent on the receipt of the audit report.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that, as far as the 2004 annual report is concerned, following receipt of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on 30 June, the board submitted its report to me on 5 July, and its contents were noted by the Government on 25 July.</P>
        <P>I understand that the report was subsequently translated into Irish, as required under the Official Languages Act, and that printing and delivery is expected to be completed within the next week. The report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas very shortly thereafter.</P>

This year an intelligence-led operation called Operation Tombola, which aims to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner. In this context, chief superintendents throughout the country have been instructed to introduce measures appropriate to their respective areas of responsibility, with particular emphasis on Garda divisions in the Dublin metropolitan region and in Border regions. The operation, while being intelligence driven, will be coupled with sporadic high-visibility policing activities. All operational garda&iacute; are involved in this initiative, with dedicated resources deployed in specific intelligence-led operations, as the need arises.</P>

The objective of the proposal is to provide for clear, transparent and fair common rules concerning return, removal, use of coercive measures, temporary custody and re-entry of third country nationals which fully take into account the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the persons concerned.</P>
        <P>This proposal falls within title IV of the TUE treaty and therefore does not automatically apply to Ireland or the United Kingdom. The proposal constitutes a development of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> and, as a result, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland will also participate.

	<P>The disbursement of funding to victims of crime is now a matter for the commission for the support of victims of crime. The commission is an independent body established in March 2005 with a remit to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and disburse funding for victim support measures.</P>
        <P>I decided to terminate funding for the Victim Support organisation with effect from 31 March 2005 because of reductions in service levels and concerns in regard to governance, accountability and value for money arising from ongoing internal difficulties in that organisation. An independent review carried out early in 2005 concluded that the organisation was terminally damaged.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the commission has received more than 60 applications for funding for measures to support victims of crime in response <Col N="679"/>to a public advertisement earlier this year. I understand these included independent applications from a number of former elements of the Victim Support organisation as well as the interim board of Victim Support. The commission examines each application on its merits and makes an independent decision in regard to eligibility for funding. I understand the commission has arranged to meet with the chairman of the interim board of Victim Support later this month in order to discuss its application for funding.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the equal opportunities child care programme provides capital and current funding to child care providers to develop services which support parents in employment, education or training. Since the programme began, I have approved more than &euro;16.3 million, of which &euro;12 million relates to capital projects, in grants to services located in County Waterford. This funding, when fully expended, is expected to lead to the creation of more than 1,300 new child care places and support a further 950 existing child care places in the county. At the end of June 2005, more than 560 of these new places had already been delivered in a mix of new and upgraded facilities. In 2005 alone, I have approved 20 individual grants in the county, totalling almost &euro;8 million, of which &euro;7.04 million relates to capital funding.</P>
        <P>It may also interest the Deputy to note that the programme provides funding to the Waterford city and county child care committees. These committees have been allocated &euro;371,000 to deliver their 2005 annual action plans and provide valuable supports to local child care providers. The type of work undertaken by city and county committees includes disseminating information, child care training, supporting groups in applying for funding under the programme, establishing and operating networks of providers and parents, administering a small grant programme for childminders, assisting in the development of school age child care in their county and promoting quality service provision.</P>

	<P>The Explosives Act 1875 provides for the control of the importation, manufacture, storage and sale of fireworks. Last February, I published a document on fireworks policy and initiated a process of consultation with a view to bringing forward proposals for amending and strengthening the provisions in the 1875 Act. My Department has received a wide range of submissions in response to the consultation document and these are being examined.</P>
        <P>It is already clear from the submissions received that, among the options for change outlined in the consultation document, there is a general acknowledgement of the need to strengthen the enforcement provisions in the 1875 Act. Accordingly, I propose to take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the House, to bring forward, on Committee Stage, amendments to provide for new offences governing the misuse of fireworks in public places and an offence of possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply. I also propose to significantly increase penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.</P>
        <P>In so far as the seizure of fireworks is concerned, the Garda authorities make every effort to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks. Where necessary, specific policing plans are put in place in areas where particular problems arise. These plans include intelligence gathering on known dealers and suppliers and, once identified, putting plans in place to arrest them and seize their stocks of illegal fireworks. Each year leading up to Hallowe&rsquo;en, special efforts are made to combat the illegal importation of fireworks. This year an intelligence-led operation called Operation Tombola, which aims to prevent and detect the organised importation for sale of fireworks in the lead up to Hallowe&rsquo;en, has been put in place by the Garda Commissioner.</P>
        <P>Over the last five years such operations have resulted in the following seizures:</P>

It was also posted on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.justice.ie</i> and much of the detailed information sought by the Deputy, to the end of 2003, is included in this report. I have arranged for another copy to be sent to him.</P>
        <P>It is intended to update these statistics regularly. The first such update, which will cover the period up to the end of 2004, will shortly be available. It will be posted on the Department&rsquo;s website and circulated to interested parties, including Oireachtas Members.</P>

        <Quest>the crime statistics across all headings for the years 1997 to 2004 for Bray, Greystones, Wicklow, Arklow and Blessington as this information was not supplied in the reply to Parliamentary Question No. 366 of 29 June 2005.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The information requested was supplied in response to Question No. 366 of 29 June 2005.</P>
        <P>In regard to crime figures, the Deputy is aware that on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I arranged for the publication of headline crime statistics on a quarterly basis in order to improve the quality of information available to the public. While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between <Col N="683"/>quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to 6 per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. Taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the tables below show the headline offences, by group, for the Garda districts of Bray, which <Col N="684"/>includes the Greystones area; Gorey, which includes the Arklow area; Wicklow; and Baltinglass, which includes the Blessington area. In interpreting these figures, account must be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. These new groups are more comprehensive and not comparable to the four crime groups previously used. For this reason, the figures for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for the years 2000 onwards. For the purposes of clarity I have supplied the details requested by the Deputy only from 2000. </P>

	<P>Legislation is being drafted by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, which will enable the engagement of the private sector in the provision and operation of speed cameras. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as the traffic law enforcement agency in the State, will be responsible for the outsourcing project. The Garda authorities inform me they have commenced preparatory work with regard to the tendering process. My <Col N="686"/>Department and the Department of Transport are assisting the process.</P>
        <P>The purpose of this initiative is to enhance overall road safety and help reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. The performance criteria to be applied will be determined by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the deployment of cameras will be focused on locations where there is an established or prospective risk of collisions. As well as making a significant contribution to road safety, this initiative will release Garda resources so that their enforcement efforts can be concentrated on other motoring offences which cause death and serious injury such as drink driving, dangerous driving and careless driving.</P>
        <P>Selection of a provider will be made by way of an open and competitive tendering process, and a request for tender, RFT, document will issue following enactment of the necessary legislation. In accordance with EU and national procurement <Col N="687"/>guidelines, this RFT will be published in the <i>EU Journal</i> and on the Government&rsquo;s procurement website. All tender proposals received will be evaluated on an individual basis in accordance with the criteria set down in the RFT.</P>

	<P> Early education covers the period from birth to six years. At present, almost all five year olds and half of four year olds attend junior infant and senior infant classes in primary schools. Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department&rsquo;s main role in the area of early childhood education focuses on pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, Traveller children and those with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Early Start programme is a pre-school intervention programme targeted at three to four year old children in areas of social disadvantage. With this programme, young children can experience an educational programme to enhance their overall development, help prevent school failure and help offset the effects of social disadvantage. The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
        <P>My Department funds 46 pre-school classes for Traveller children. In the special needs sector there are 14 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition to this, ten stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis.</P>
        <P>Targeted early childhood education provision will be a key element of the new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which I launched in May of this year. The plan&rsquo;s objective is to concentrate early education actions on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend urban or town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. On a phased basis, the 150 urban or town primary school communities serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage will be provided with access to early education for children aged from three up to school enrol<Col N="688"/>ment, who will subsequently attend these primary schools. The action plan will be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years and will involve the creation of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s approach will be to work in partnership with other Departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing child care programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner. The bulk of pre-school places are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years. The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to child care groups, including to community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage.</P>
        <P>Pre-school education in Dublin includes 12 Early Start projects in the north Dublin area. In addition, the Rutland Street project in Se&aacute;n McDermott Street has been operational since 1969. It caters for approximately 95 pupils aged three to five years and includes a pre-school centre, a special staff teaching allocation, classroom assistants, secretarial services and cooks, together with the provision of school meals. There are also seven pre-schools for Travellers and three pre-schools for autistic children in north Dublin.</P>
        <P>The Northside Partnership is developing an integrated plan entitled &ldquo;Preparing for Life&rdquo; which is intended to address the needs of children at each stage of their development in order to better prepare them for school. The plan involves mentoring and group training for parents to improve their skills, esteem and aspirations for their children. It is intended that the project will result in improved physical and psychological health and better educational outcomes for children at key stages in their development to the point of reception in school.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years at primary level. The most recent figure available for average class size at primary level refers to the 2003-04 school year, when the average class size was 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which includes resource teachers, <Col N="689"/>has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to a projected 17.1:1 in 2004-05. At post-primary level the pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</P>
        <P>More than 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all these priorities.</P>
        <P>In regard to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to less than 1,500 in 1998. Now, one out of every five primary school teachers works specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, the new action plan for educational inclusion, which I launched last May, aims to ensure the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP, which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban or town and 300 rural and 150 second-level schools, will <Col N="690"/>be included in the SSP. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis &mdash; starting during the current school year &mdash; and will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P>The key principle of early intervention underpins both the early childhood education measure and many of the literacy and numeracy measures under the new action plan. Key measures to be implemented on a phased basis over the next five years include: improving identification of disadvantage in respect of which a standardised approach will allow my Department to target resources more effectively; increasing early childhood education provision in the most disadvantaged communities; improving supports for pupils with low attainment levels in literacy and numeracy; enhancing procedures for measuring the outcomes achieved from educational inclusion measures; enhancing integration and partnership working, both within the education sector itself and cross-sectorally; enhancing professional development supports for principals and school staff; and enhancing research and evaluation.</P>
        <P>Also central to the success of the action plan will be an increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level, target-setting and measurement of progress and outcomes to ensure the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The action plan aims to concentrate early childhood education actions on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 150 urban or town primary schools, participating in the new school support programme, and identified as serving the most disadvantaged communities. The early childhood actions under the new plan will be well targeted and my Department will work in partnership with other Departments and agencies with a view to meeting the overall care and education needs of the children involved in an integrated way. A strong emphasis will be placed on adding value to the work of other providers by embedding quality early learning within child care provision.</P>

        <Quest>the action she will take in response to the disparity in third level progression highlighted by the recent City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee report which, among other findings, gave a 60% rate of third level progression for Rathmines as against a 7.8% rate for Finglas.</Quest>
        <QRef>[28019/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Comprehensive surveys of participation in third level education, based on CAO <Col N="691"/>data, have been conducted since the 1980s by the Higher Education Authority. The most recent sample survey, for 2005, shows there has been a significant improvement in the progression rate of young people in the Finglas-Ballymun, Dublin 11, area to third level education which has risen from 14% in 1998 to 27% of the school-leaving age group in 2003. This compares to an average participation rate for the whole of Dublin of 45% and with the exceptionally high participation rate of areas such as Rathmines in Dublin 6 at 71%.</P>
        <P>However, it is clear that while there is welcome improvement, some counties and districts have admission rates below the national average and it is here that we need to continue to focus our efforts. A full study of access in 2004, being carried out on behalf of the HEA and scheduled for publication later this year, will give a more comprehensive review of both the social background of new entrants and trends in admission by county or postal district of origin. The report to which the Deputy refers has been brought to the attention of the national office for equity of access.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to focus on raising participation in Finglas and surrounding areas through access initiatives such as the north Dublin access, NDA, programme and the Ballymun into third level education, BITE, initiative which have seen more than a decade of collaboration between Dublin City University and northside, Finglas/Cabra and Ballymun area partnerships. This network has developed close links with students in 26 primary and 16 secondary schools in the area. The range of activities and initiatives include school and campus visits; including summer camps, extra tuition; peer mentoring; and additional third level places and a scholarship programme, all of which support and encourage more young people to access and participate in higher education.</P>
        <P>Students are also being encouraged and supported in making the choice to participate in higher education by improvements in the student maintenance grant schemes as well as the additional funding allocated through the third level access fund, which in 2004 was &euro;34 million. These measures include the awarding since 2000 of a higher or top-up level of grant to students from families on low incomes. There is also the student assistance fund, which is allocated to students in need through their higher education institution, and the millennium partnership fund, which supports the needs of students identified through area partnership and community groups.</P>
        <P>A key area for progress identified in the action plan, published last December by the HEA and the national office for equity of access to higher education, is the development of a framework of access policies and initiatives ensuring all disadvantaged schools, areas and communities <Col N="692"/>are linked to the access programmes and routes of entry of at least one higher education institution in their region. The national office is in the process of developing this framework, a key element of which will be advocating and supporting continued and closer collaboration between a wide range of stakeholders nationally, including the higher education and community sectors.</P>

        <P>The Deputy is aware that it is proposed to rationalise the primary educational provision in New Ross. There is general agreement locally to this development.</P>
        <P>Architectural assessments have recently been carried out on all four primary schools to determine which, if any, would be suitable to act as hosts for the proposed rationalisation. These assessments will enable my Department to take a view on how infrastructure can be developed to facilitate its proposals. In addition, the local authority has agreed to provide my Department with updated demographics on the area so that an informed decision can be taken on school sizes. When these matters have been resolved, my Department will move to address the issue of enrolment polices for the proposed school re-configuration. On finalisation of this issue, any required building works can be considered for inclusion in a school building programme. Any such projects will attract a high priority band 1.4 rating which applies to projects to facilitate amalgamations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 399 to 402, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is at an early stage of architectural planning. However, owing to a continuing decline in enrolments and the level of investment which would be required to facilitate a relatively small number of pupils, it was decided not to allow the proposed project to progress through architectural planning until a complete review of the long-term viability of the school had been carried out.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project was initially planned for a long-term projected enrolment of 400 pupils based on demographic information available at that time. In the event, the population did not increase as expected and enrolment in the school continued to decline as it has done for over ten years. For example, in the 2004-05 school year, 187 mainstream students and 65 further education students were attending the school. This compares with 315 mainstream students and 48 further education students in 1995. In the past five years overall enrolment declined by some 22% alone. This was rightly a matter of concern to my Department given the level of investment which it was being required to make.</P>
        <P>It is common practice for my Department to review all projects before they are included in a capital programme. I expect the review being carried out on the particular project in question to be finalised shortly and contact will be made <Col N="695"/>directly with the school authority in relation to this matter at that time.</P>

	<P>My Department is responsible for teacher education and development, with particular regard to initial teacher education covering the colleges of education and the education departments in the universities and colleges. Applications for the higher diploma in education are made through the Higher Diploma in Education, National University of Ireland, Applications Centre, known as the HDEAC, which was established in 1998.</P>
        <P>The HDEAC is agent for, and acts on behalf of, the universities participating in the application system and the application regulations, procedures and timetable are agreed annually by these universities. Applicants are awarded points on the basis on performance in their primary degree, any additional relevant academic qualifications and teaching experience. Applications are made to the HDEAC through one common application form. In the case of Trinity College, applicants continue to apply directly to the university and I understand that places on the higher diploma in education course are awarded on the <Col N="696"/>basis of academic qualifications and the results of a competitive interview process.</P>
        <P>The current quota for admissions for the 2005-2006 programmes is 1,000 and I have no plans to increase this number at present. My Department and the HEA are continuing to review the supply and demand of second level teachers on an ongoing basis. Officials in my Department maintain contact with the various education departments in regard to the diploma and other postgraduate qualifications for teachers at primary and second levels and I am ensuring that this process continues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With respect to the type of students that are successful in getting places on the State-funded higher diploma programmes, the Deputy may we aware that I have said that the entry system should be changed to ensure that enough students with a background in all the subjects we require teachers in, but particularly in maths, science and Irish, get places on the higher diploma programme. My Department is working on this with the colleges of education.</P>

An application in respect of this pupil for school transport to the school referred to by the Deputy was received by my Department in October 2004. However, as she did not meet the conditions prescribed under the school transport scheme, she was deemed ineligible for free transport to this particular school. My Department advised at the time, however, that she was eligible to be considered for concessionary fare-paying transport subject to the usual conditions.</P><Col N="697"/>
        <P>An appeal against my Department&rsquo;s decision was submitted in November 2004 to the independent school transport appeals board. The board considered the appeal and found that the terms of the school transport scheme had been fairly and appropriately applied in respect of the pupil concerned. The pupil&rsquo;s mother was advised of the outcome of the appeal on 15 December, 2004. There is no record of a subsequent appeal in this case.</P>

My Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement.</P>
        <P>I confirm that the pupil in question is enrolled in a mainstream primary school with appropriate supports. The pupil had also been in receipt of a home tuition grant. My Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants. The following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system. There are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is working specifically with children with special needs. There are nearly 6,000 special needs assistants. More than &euro;30 million is spent on school transport for special needs pupils and more than &euro;3 million goes towards specialised equipment and materials.</P>
        <P>My Department has written to this pupil&rsquo;s parents confirming its intention to discontinue the practice of sanctioning home tuition grants for pupils who are also in full-time education. This has also been communicated to the pupil&rsquo;s school. In the interim my Department has sanctioned the continuance of the home tuition grant for this pupil to the end of the current school term to allow further consideration to be given to <Col N="699"/>the pupil&rsquo;s needs. In this regard, the school has been requested to make contact with the local special education needs organiser to discuss how the needs of the pupil can be met by the school. It is important that the family keep in close contact with the local senior education needs organiser to ensure that if the pupil has to miss a significant number of school days this year that the need for further home tuition can be considered.</P>

	<P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy. A report in regard to the circumstances of the case has been requested from Bus &Eacute;ireann, which organises the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department. When this report has been received, my Department will advise the Deputy of the position.</P>
        <P>In regard to the general administration of the school transport scheme, the position is that Bus &Eacute;ireann issues tickets, or travel permits, to pupils who have been approved transport on a service. In addition to specifying the pupil&rsquo;s name, the pick-up and set-down point and the period of validity, the permit specifies that pupils must carry tickets at all times when travelling to and from school. In addition, the invoice issued by Bus &Eacute;ireann in respect of tickets specifies that only those pupils in possession of a valid permit will be carried on a transport service. In line with transport systems in general, this is deemed to be the most appropriate method of identification and allows drivers and other personnel to control travel and regulate loadings.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by Bus &Eacute;ireann that listings of pupils who have been issued with tickets for the current term will be issued to bus operators in mid-October. Such an arrangement is not possible in the case of pupils who avail of scheduled public transport services.</P>
        <P>The issue of listings at an earlier date is not possible due to the number of late applications and late payments received in school transport offices throughout the country. It would be of little benefit issuing such lists until Bus &Eacute;ireann is satisfied that the vast bulk of tickets have been issued and that the listing represents a true reflection of all pupils who are authorised to travel.</P>
        <P>More than 134,000 pupils are carried by in excess of 3,000 vehicles under my Department&rsquo;s school transport scheme. In view of the recent focus on safety measures in regard to school transport and the obvious administrative burden in operating a scheme of this size, the Deputy will appreciate the importance of ensuring that only those pupils who have been approved transport are availing of a service and that additional pupils are not carried which may compromise safety measures.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The school to which the Deputy refers is included in the rural dimension of my Department&rsquo;s Giving children an even break programme aimed at combating educational disadvantage. The school receives additional financial resources to provide educational supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The new action plan for educational inclusion, entitled Delivering equality of opportunity in schools, or DEIS, which will be introduced on a phased basis starting during the current school year, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people, from pre-school to completion of upper second-level education, i.e. three to 18 years, from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The new plan is the outcome of the first full review of all programmes for tackling educational disadvantage that have been put in place over the past 20 years and it will involve an additional annual investment of some &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the creation of about 300 additional posts across the education system generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key element of this new action plan is the putting in place of a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage in our primary and second-level schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The identification and analysis processes are being managed by the ERC on behalf of my Department. As a result of the identification process, approximately 600 primary schools, comprising 300 urban-town and 300 rural, and 150 second-level schools will be included in a new school support programme, SSP. The SSP will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools and school clusters-communities with a concentrated level of educational disadvantage. We anticipate being in a position to notify participating schools in relation to the outcome of the ongoing identification process by the end of the year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 420 and 421 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is keenly aware of the impending closure of the school to which the Deputy refers. It has been working over the summer months on a cost verification exercise in relation to all options presenting to accommodate the new school. This is a complex exercise given the type and level of level of information which must be gathered and then assessed. Negotiations are also a part of the process.</P>
        <P>On 6 October last, my Department received the final information it required from one of the parties concerned. Now that this information is to hand, I expect a decision on an accommodation solution for the new school to issue shortly.</P>

	<P>An application for additional accommodation for September 2005 was received from the school to which the Deputy refers.

Therefore, it was considered that appropriate accommodation was available for use by the school in question.</P>
        <P>The position in relation to the funding of VEC schools is that payments are made to VECs as part of a block grant that is designed to meet VEC overheads and other activities in addition to the second-level programme. The Department does not earmark allocations for individual schools or for the various activities of VECs. My Department has recently received a request from the County Tipperary, South Riding, VEC for increased funding, including the school referred to by the Deputy. The request is currently being given full consideration and my Department will revert directly to the VEC in the near future.</P>

	<P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs. The level of teaching and special needs assistant support for special educational needs is determined by the SENO in accordance with my Department&rsquo;s resourcing policy for special educational needs. The procedures for appointment of teachers and-or SNAs arising from such decisions, are outlined in my Department&rsquo;s circular letter PPT 01/05. This circular states that, in regard to additional teaching support, school authorities within their teacher quota may proceed to make the necessary staffing adjustments on receipt of the decision of the SENO.</P>
        <P>All other schools must await the direction of the Department of Education and Science before making any teacher staff adjustments.</P>
        <P>In situations where schools have over quota posts, my Department routinely requires that these posts be utilised to meet new and emerging needs within such schools, including those of pupils who have special educational needs, where appropriate. In the case of the school in question, my Department decided that the teaching hours recommended by the SENO should be met from within the school&rsquo;s existing resources, which included 5.5 surplus teaching posts.</P>
        <P>An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation. The school in question appealed this decision to the independent appeals committee and was granted a further 0.09 whole-time equivalent posts. This committee operates independently of my Department and its decisions are final.</P>

	<P>I am most anxious that all children receive an education appropriate to their needs. As the Deputy may be aware, the home tuition scheme is primarily intended to provide compensatory instruction for pupils who have a medical ailment that is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school. In this context, my Department provides home tuition grants in respect of pupils who cannot attend school at all, or who are absent for a significant proportion of the school year. My Department also sanctions home tuition in cases where children are awaiting a suitable school placement. My Department considers that school-based education provision is the most appropriate intervention for all children and has discontinued the practice whereby children who are in full-time education provision would also be able to avail of home tuition grants.</P>
        <P>The following dedicated resources are now deployed to support children with special educational needs in the primary system: over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs; nearly 6,000 special needs assistants; more than &euro;30 million on school transport for special needs pupils; and more than &euro;3 million towards specialised equipment and materials.</P>
        <P>Two of the children referred to by the Deputy were in receipt of a home tuition grant while awaiting school placement. I can confirm that they are now enrolled in a special school since September 2005. Their needs are being catered for in a special class for pupils with autism with a maximum pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 together with special needs assistant support. As these pupils are now in full-time education, the matter of the continuance of home tuition no longer arises.</P>
        <P>The third pupil is also enrolled in a special class for pupils with autism in a special school with enhanced supports. This pupil is currently in receipt of a home tuition grant. My Department has written to the pupil&rsquo;s parents confirming its intention to discontinue the practice of sanctioning home tuition grants for pupils who are also in full-time education. This has also been communicated to the pupil&rsquo;s school. In the interim, however, my Department has sanctioned the continuance of the grant for this pupil to the end of the current school term to allow further consideration to be given to the needs of the pupil. In this regard, the school has been requested to make contact with the local special education needs organiser, SENO, to discuss how the needs of the pupil can be met by the school.</P>

        <Quest>the assistance available to dyslexic children with reference to the Letterkenny branch of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland; and her plans to improve these services.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has been providing annual funding of &euro;63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. In addition, it has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association. More specifically, last June my Department approved payment of a once-off grant of &euro;16,400 to the Letterkenny branch of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland. The purpose of the grant is to develop a model of co-operation with local schools and their resource teachers in relation to services for children with dyslexia and how the Letterkenny branch can link in with their local schools.</P>
        <P>The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms and the maintenance of a data-base of pupils with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, who are in receipt of special education services in primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include: the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for pupils with dyslexia; and the development, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, of an information resource on dyslexia which is available in cd-rom, dvd and video format.</P>
        <P>In addition to measures outlined, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures, which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government&rsquo;s decision to approve the establish<Col N="710"/>ment of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.</P>
        <P>The NCSE, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports. The council has a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. The council has a local area presence through a network of over 70 special educational needs organisers, SENOs.</P>
        <P>On the legislative front, the Oireachtas has approved the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. This Act sets out the rights and entitlements of persons with special educational needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and provides the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</P>
        <P>My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local SENO directly for this support.</P>
        <P>Training is available through the 21 teacher education dentres nationally for teachers using ICT and assistive technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia. The provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning suppport needs.</P>
        <P>There are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs, including with dyslexia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such <Col N="711"/>children operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1.</P>
        <P>At second level, each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of fewer than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more, receive a full learning support post.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil. There are a total of 531 remedial-learning support teachers, 689 guidance posts and 1,599 whole-time equivalent resource teachers currently in place. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs.</P>
        <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</P>
        <P>In September 2003, my Department established the special education support service, SESS, to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The SESS, which is hosted in Cork Education Centre, provides a nationwide service to teachers and special needs assistants. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the SESS is currently developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas: autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the education centre network.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</P>

	<P>The primary school curriculum 1999 affirms the centrality of the arts in primary education and incorporates the subjects visual arts, music and drama within the curriculum area of arts education. The curriculum envisages that all children will have access to a range of experiences in arts education, which will enable them to communicate their ideas, feelings, insights and experiences through image, music, language, gesture and movement. It also envisages that children will have opportunities to respond as makers, viewers, listeners or readers to their own work and to the expressive creativity of artists, composers, writers and performers. When planning for the implementation of arts education, schools are encouraged to develop relationships with local and national artists and arts institutions such as concert halls, art galleries and museums so that children are enabled to experience visual arts, music and drama in such settings.</P>
        <P>At second level, the new leaving certificate music syllabus is now well established and preparations for the introduction of a revised syllabus for leaving certificate art are well under way. The implementation of this syllabus will be <Col N="713"/>accompanied by a comprehensive programme of in-career development for teachers. The introduction of this syllabus will result in a significant increase in interest in art as a subject at senior cycle.</P>
        <P>In the transition year programme, schools offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils&rsquo; interest in the arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity to interact with practising artists in their own classrooms and in other contexts.</P>

        <P>Circular letter 6/98, issued by my Department in February 1998, sets out the schedule of assistant principal and special duties teacher posts in voluntary secondary schools as agreed between the respective management bodies, the teacher <Col N="714"/>unions and my Department. Circular 5/98, also issued by my Department in February 1998, sets out the agreed national criteria for the level and types of duties for the posts of assistant principal and special duties teachers.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of circular 5/98, school management, following consultation between the principal and staff, shall determine the duties which need to be performed for the effective internal management of the school. In identifying the post duties required by the school, account shall be taken of the needs of the school, including, special educational needs, where appropriate. Duties should reflect the grade and level of responsibility entailed by the post, taking into account the size and individual needs of the school.</P>
        <P>As the schedule of posts of responsibility is agreed between the respective school management bodies, the teacher unions and my Department, claims for additional posts are a matter for the teacher&rsquo;s conciliation council which is comprised of representatives of the teachers unions, school management, the Department of Finance and my Department.</P>

	<P>The transition year programme is available as an option to all second level schools. Currently, more than 500 schools are providing the programme. The transition year programme is suitable to students of all levels of ability. Its aim is to provide students with a broad educational experience that will allow them to mature while developing their personal, academic and social skills. There is not a prescribed national curriculum for transition year. Each school has the freedom to design its own programme in accordance with the needs of its students.</P>
        <P>The management authority of each school carries responsibility for making all decisions regarding the transition year programme in that school. Guidelines have been issued by my Department to support schools in this process. In some schools, the programme is compulsory for all students. In those that offer it as an option, circumstances may arise where it is necessary to limit the number of students who can avail of it. In schools where restrictions apply, an open and transparent selection process should be in place <Col N="715"/>which is based on criteria that promote the educational well-being of all students.</P>

	<P>My Department has acknowledged the need for accommodation at the school to which the Deputy refers. However, the fact that the school is located in a mature part of Lucan complicates the identification of a suitable site, particularly given its desire to remain in close proximity to its church. The school authority undertook to carry out its own negotiations to acquire a site to meet its needs in this regard. However, in the absence of any firm proposal from the school authority, my Department is now considering alternative options in an effort to resolve the accommodation difficulties at the school.</P>

	<P>I am conscious of the pressures being placed on education providers in areas of major population growth. To this end my Department is prioritising the provision of new and enhanced educational facilities in these areas. The prioritisation criteria, which were recently revised in consultation with the education partners, allocate a top priority, band 1, rating to school building projects in such areas.</P>
        <P>My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to which local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and sites are reserved, where necessary, to ensure as far as possible the timely delivery of any required education infrastructure.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, under the provisions of the strategic development zones, SDZ, it is generally the position that sites must be reserved for schools and also that the schools must be developed in line with the housing and other developments. In addition, the school planning section of my Department is working proactively with some local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced co-operation has the effect of minimising my Department&rsquo;s land requirements and thus reducing site costs while at the same time providing local communities with new schools with enhanced facilities.</P>
        <P>With regard to the provision of free sites for school infrastructure, the Deputy will be aware that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 do not place any onus on developers to provide school sites other than at market rates.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 443 together.</P>
        <P>The enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 and the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, which has been operational since the 1 January 2005, provide a legislative and structural framework for the support of all children with disabilities, including those with autism.</P>
        <P>The Act provides a comprehensive legislative framework to govern the delivery of these services while the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will improve and speed up the delivery of services to pupils with special needs, their parents and schools. The Act sets out a range of services, which must be provided, including assessments, education plans and support services. Every child with special educational needs is entitled to an individual education plan, IEP, prepared by appropriate professionals. The IEP will set out the child&rsquo;s educational needs, the special education and related support services to be provided to him or her and the goals, which the child is to achieve over a period of not more than 12 months. Parents have a right to participate and provide inputs in the preparation of the IEP and the IEP is subject to regular review and amendment.</P>
        <P>While the sections of the Act relating to IEPs have not yet commenced, my Department is aware that some schools have already initiated processes whereby individual plans have been drawn up in respect of pupils with special educational needs. This process generally involves school staff, the pupil&rsquo;s parents, the school psychologist and any other professionals involved with the pupil. Part of the requirement of such plans is that they are reviewed regularly with all those involved in drawing them up.</P>
        <P>The provision of education services for pupils of post primary age with autism is dependent on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupil. The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure <Col N="718"/>the maximum possible integration of pupils with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. Where mainstream provision is not appropriate pupils can be catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are 107 special schools in the country at present. These schools cater for children from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil-teacher ratio and other staffing supports.</P>
        <P>My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs, including those with autism, and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services. It is my intention that my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Health and Children in developing services for children with autism.</P>
        <P>Information for parents of children with autism on health-related interventions such as therapy services can be accessed from the Health Service Executive. Specific information on appropriate educational interventions can be sought from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs. Questions on the provision of home tuition for children with autism who require early intervention or are waiting to secure an appropriate school placement can be referred to my Department&rsquo;s special education section.</P>
        <P>No assessment of parental opinion on the adequacy of the information and the expertise which they can access has been carried out by my Department. However, I am satisfied that with more than 70 SENOs at local level nationwide, parents will ultimately be able to access information on the various educational interventions and options at an earlier stage.</P>

	<P>My Department is fully aware of the need to provide a solution to the long-term <Col N="719"/>accommodation needs of the school to which the Deputy refers and it is actively considering two options. The first option is the provision of a new school on the site to which the Deputy refers. This matter is being pursued by the property management section of the Office for Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in site acquisitions generally. The second option, which could offer a better value for money solution, involves rationalisation of exiting providers in the area. Discussions are ongoing with the respective boards of management in this regard. The Deputy will appreciate that rationalisation is a sensitive issue for those concerned. It would not, therefore, be helpful to treat the matter as a <i>fait accompli</i> by developing plans to accommodate an unconnected school in premises owned by those involved in the rationalisation process or to be prescriptive in terms of the time needed by the parties to explore the full implications of rationalisation proposals. This matter can only be finalised when the relevant discussions have been completed and a decision has been taken by the boards of management concerned to effect rationalisation. The local authority will be notified of the position as soon as a resolution has been reached.</P>

	<P>The level of student intake to the colleges of education is determined annually by my Department taking account of the supply of and demand for primary teachers and also having regard to available resources. The demand for primary teachers is influenced by a number of factors including: the application of the agreed staffing schedule; demographic trends; the number of teachers opting to take career breaks; the number of secondments approved; and the age at which teachers opt to retire on a voluntary basis. The creation of additional posts in a part<Col N="721"/>icular school year and the retention of posts arising from the allocation of the demographic dividend also affect the demand for teachers.</P>
        <P>It is considered necessary for my Department to regulate the intake to the colleges as they are fully funded by the taxpayer. In that context my Department has capped the number of entrants to the colleges of education through the bachelor of education degree programme at 1,000 and the post-graduate programme at 280 for the 2005-06 academic year. My Department does not have authority to regulate the intake of students to private institutions.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment. The nationality requirement as set out in Clause 4.5 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme 2005 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">Candidates must: hold EU Nationality; or have Official Refugee Status; or have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.</P>

        <P>I have no plans to extend the nationality clause of the student support schemes. Any extension to <Col N="722"/>the scope of the maintenance grants scheme can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.</P>

	<P>The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</P>
        <P>Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme. Thirteen towns with significant school-going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government&rsquo;s RAPID programme, now also have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. Towns which have educational welfare officer allocated to them include Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo, Naas, Castlebar, Longford, Tuam, Tullamore, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</P>
        <P>The service is developing on a continuing basis. The total authorised staffing complement is currently 94, comprising 16 headquarters and support staff, five regional managers, 12 senior educational welfare officers, SEWOs, and 61 educational welfare officers, EWOs. There are 742 post-primary and 3,284 primary schools in the State and since September 2005 every county is served by an educational welfare service.</P>

	<P>At present, National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, staff are based in office premises in a total of 21 locations throughout the country, including six temporary offices. The cost of acquisition and fit-out of offices for NEPS are matters for which the Office of Public Works, OPW, has overall responsibility. The general, non-pay, outturn for NEPS in 2004, met from the 2004 financial provision to my Department, amounted to &euro;2.3 million. This expenditure covered a wide range of running costs relating to NEPS as a national organisation, including the network of offices. Details of all expenditure incurred by NEPS in respect of each of the premises in question are not readily available from my Department&rsquo;s records.</P>

	<P>It is difficult to give the precise number of applicants for catchment boundary or concessionary transport who failed to secure a place for a number of reasons. In the first instance, a large number of families do not submit remittances until very shortly before, or even after the new school year is under way. In addition, a large number of new applications on behalf of eligible children, catchment boundary children and concessionary children have been received since the school year began, and these are currently being processed.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to available seats is changing on a daily basis, according as arrangements are being put in place to accommodate fresh applications and as remittances are received. In addition, some primary schools are returning, for cancellation, unused tickets that were originally issued to fully eligible children but were subsequently not needed. This has in turn released seats for reallocation. Tickets are still in the process of being returned.</P>

	<P>There are two types of assessment which could arise under my Department&rsquo;s remit in a case of this nature &mdash; an assessment by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or an assessment of needs by the National Council for Special Education. The school attended by the pupil in question has an assigned NEPS psychologist. I understand that the school principal has already discussed the pupil&rsquo;s needs with the NEPS psychologist on a number of occasions. The principal has not requested a formal psychological assessment by NEPS. This was not considered necessary as previous psychological reports were already to hand. The NEPS psychologist remains available to advise the school further in regard to managing behaviour within the school.</P>

	<P>An application for additional accommodation for September 2005 was received from the school to which the Deputy refers.

	<P>The Deputy will be aware that the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools to meet the needs of children with low incidence special needs is based on the individually assessed needs of these pupils. Hours are sanctioned for these children by the local special educational needs organiser who then informs my Department of the allocations. As many additional allocations will have been made recently and staffing allocations are still being finalised, my Department in consultation with the National Council for Special Education will be in a position to supply up to date figures to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>There are now more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares with fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the introduction of the new general allocation system last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching <Col N="729"/>hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</P>
        <P>Addressing the concerns of small and rural schools was among the reasons I initiated a review of the general allocation model as originally announced. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure that they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools. The main purpose of this circular is to provide guidance for schools on the deployment and organisation of the teaching resources that were allocated under the general allocation model. Reference is also made in this circular to the deployment of additional teaching resources that are allocated to schools for the support of individual pupils with low incidence disabilities.</P>
        <P>In introducing the general allocation system, transitional arrangements were also introduced whereby transitional hours would be given to schools to cater for children that had previously been allocated individual teaching resources but which it would not be possible for the school to provide under their allocation under the general allocation model. In the circumstances no child should have experienced a loss of resource teaching hours.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied at this stage that the general allocation system is working well in schools and has been generally favourably received by schools. My Department will continue to work with schools and the education partners with a view to ensuring that this remains the case going forward.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, a new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools have been provided with learning support-resource teaching, LS-RT hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. According to my Department&rsquo;s records, the general allocation for the school in question is one full-time permanent teaching post and five part-time hours. The school has combined its part-time hours with hours for individual pupils with low incidence special needs. Consequently, the school has three full-time teaching posts to cater for the special educational needs of its pupils.</P>
        <P>The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs, such as hearing impairment, will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school has been allocated enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</P>
        <P>The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently issued a comprehensive circular, Sp Ed 02/05, to all primary schools regarding the organisation of teaching resources for pupils who need additional support in mainstream primary schools.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 470, 473, 474 and 498 together.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Clane, Prosperous, Sallins, Naas and Kill, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s boys national school, Clane, received &euro;100,000, from my Department, under the permanent initiative, to facilitate increasing numbers, in 2003. At post-primary level Scoil Mhuire Community School, Clane, received &euro;148,963 under the summer works scheme to improve the integrity of its building.</P>
        <P>A major building project is under construction at Scoil an Linbh &Iacute;osa, Prosperous, which is due to be completed in the first quarter of 2006. Also, tenders are being sought for the provision of a major extension at St. Farnan&rsquo;s post-primary school.</P>
        <P>At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth&rsquo;s and St. Mary&rsquo;s national school and St. Conleth&rsquo;s Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been provided at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh. In addition approval has been given to St. Corban&rsquo;s and Gaelscoil N&aacute;s na Riogh in Naas, Scoil Naomh Brighde, Kill, Kilashee and Caragh national schools for additional accommodation for September 2005.</P>
        <P>At Sallins national school, a seven classrooms extension is under construction. When completed, this extension will increase capacity from nine classrooms to 16. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classrooms will commence architectural planning this year.</P>
        <P>A brand new state of the art 16-classroom school together with a double autistic unit is under construction in Naas town. This project, in <Col N="734"/>particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas. Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David&rsquo;s national school and Two Mile House national school. The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also being assessed.</P>
        <P>At post-primary level, the management authority of St. Patrick&rsquo;s post-primary school, County Kildare VEC, is progressing plans to re-locate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupils. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St. Mary&rsquo;s College which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Meanscoil Iognaid R&iacute;s and further accommodation needs at the school are in planning.</P>
        <P>All these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</P>

	<P>As part of the expansion of the devolved scheme for primary school building works, a grant of &euro;250,000 was sanctioned to enable the management authorities of the school in question to provide additional accommodation. The initiative allows boards of management to address their accommodation and building priorities with a guaranteed amount of funding and gives boards of management control of the building project. It is my understanding that the board of management is in the process of obtaining planning permission and expects that the project will be on site by March 2006. My Department has no request for any further facilities for this school.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 492 to 494, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, my Department announced the new general allocation system of teaching resources last May with a view to it being implemented in all primary schools with effect from the start of the current school year. The general allocation scheme is designed to ensure that each school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of children with high incidence special needs, such as dyslexia, and children with learning support needs. Resource teaching hours for children with low incidence special needs will continue to be provided on the basis of an individual application for each child.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied at this stage that the general allocation system is working well in schools and that every effort is being made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs and, in this regard, in recent years significant additional resources have been made available to schools to enable them to provide for children with such needs.</P><Col N="740"/>
        <P>Children with more severe disabilities are catered for in special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups. There are three special schools in operation in County Kildare at present catering for approximately 157 pupils with special needs with a pupil-teacher ratio ranging form 6:1 to 11:1. These schools cater for pupils from four to 18 years of age and each school enjoys a significantly reduced pupil teacher ratio and other staffing supports. Additional special needs assistant support is provided if deemed necessary. Special schools also receive increased rates of capitation funding.</P>
        <P>In addition to these schools, I can confirm that the following special needs provision in County Kildare has been sanctioned by my Department to cater for the special educational needs, SEN, of primary school pupils: 11 special classes for pupils with autism at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1; five special classes for pupils with mild general learning disabilities at a pupil-teacher ratio of 11:1; one special class for pupils with moderate general learning disabilities at a pupil-teacher ratio of 8:1.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All special classes attached to ordinary mainstream schools enjoy the same increased levels of staffing and funding as are made available to the special schools. Children with special educational needs attending special classes attached to ordinary schools may, where appropriate, be integrated into ordinary classes for periods of the school day and, in that way, benefit from being able to socialise with their non-disabled peers. My Department also provides funding for the Saplings project, a facility sanctioned on a pilot basis which uses applied behavioural analysis methodologies for children with autism. There are approximately 30 children enrolled in the facility.</P>
        <P>While children are awaiting a suitable educational placement, my Department may sanction home tuition as an interim measure, if appropriate. At second level, there are approximately 94 whole time equivalent teachers in place in County Kildare to support pupils with special educational needs.</P>
        <P>At this stage there are approximately 299 whole time equivalent special needs assistants, SNAs, in primary and second level schools in County Kildare supporting children with special needs. The National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing any applications for additional special educational needs, SEN, resources. I am confident that the advent of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in County Kildare, receive the support they require when and where they require it.</P>

        <Quest>the action she will take to address the issue of pupil-teacher ratios in primary schools throughout County Kildare which currently have pupil-teacher ratios higher than the national average; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio in recent years. The pupil teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.1:1, projected, in 2004-05. Over 4,500 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address these priorities.</P>
        <P>With regard to providing for children with special educational needs, there are now over 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware of the new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched recently. This action plan will result in the reduction in class sizes of 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in 150 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. The deployment of additional posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</P>

        <Quest>the number of incidents of school bullying reported at primary and post-primary level throughout the country in each of the past five years; the action taken or proposed to combat the problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Individual school management authorities are not required to report to my Department on incidences of bullying. Therefore, the <Col N="742"/>information requested by the Deputy is not available in my Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, I can assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools about anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills, including self awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the strand Myself and Others from infant classes. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module on Belonging and Integrating.</P>
        <P>My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</P>
        <P>The school development planning initiative plays an important role in supporting schools to raise awareness of the need for anti-bullying measures. In addition, my Department funds a number of support services and pilot initiatives which provide direct assistance to schools in dealing with the issue of bullying.</P>

        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of a panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. Details of this process, and the conditions that apply to the scheme, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. NEPS also provides assistance to all schools that suffer from critical incidents, regardless of whether they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. The number of NEPS psychologists has increased almost threefold from 43 on establishment to 124 at present.</P>
        <P>On behalf of my Department, the Public Appointments Service has recently conducted a recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS, with recruitment being targeted in such a way as to increase the numbers of NEPS psychologists in priority areas. Any increase in the number of psychologists in NEPS must take account of Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to achieving the highest possible standards of literacy both for those in school and for adults of all ages is reflected in the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. This contains a special initiative on &ldquo;Tackling Educational Disadvantage &mdash; Literacy, Numeracy and Early School Leavers&rdquo;. Its commitment is also evident in the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-05. Both the special initiative and the national action plan recognise literacy skills <Col N="744"/>as important prerequisites for lifelong learning and for social and economic participation.</P>
        <P>The special initiative and the national action plan focus on putting in place a range of measures to prevent and ameliorate literacy difficulties. These measures include systematically monitoring literacy attainment levels both in schools and among adults; ensuring that pupils with serious literacy difficulties in disadvantaged primary schools are supported in improving their attainment levels and providing opportunities for adult learners, particularly in the area of literacy.</P>
        <P>The new action plan for educational inclusion, DEIS, delivering equality of opportunity in schools, which I launched in May, aims to ensure that the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities are prioritised and effectively addressed. The plan provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The school support programme will bring together a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage and build upon them. Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 second level schools will be included in it. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of &euro;40 million on full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A key underlying principle of DEIS is that of early intervention. It will focus on identifying children who are having difficulty with reading and writing at an early stage and assisting them before their problems become entrenched. In implementing the action plan a number of measures will be rolled out to tackle literacy problems in schools serving disadvantaged communities. These measures will include a new advisory service at primary level; more access to initiatives such as reading recovery and first steps; targeted extension of the demonstration library project at second level; a new family literacy project; targeted early childhood education provision for 150 urban-town school communities; maximum class sizes of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in the 150 urban-town primary schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage; interventions to enhance student attendance, educational progression, retention and attainment.</P>
        <P>Central to the success of the action plan will be increased emphasis on planning at school and school cluster level. There will be a strong focus on target setting and the measurement of progress and outcomes to ensure that the increased investment is matched by an improvement in educational outcomes for the children and young people concerned.</P><Col N="745"/>
        <P>My Department continues to support an expanding range of programmes and initiatives for adults who are experiencing literacy difficulties. In 2004, &euro;29.2 million was spent on adult literacy and community education services which were availed of by over 33,000 clients. This represents a significant increase from 1997 when funding of &euro;1 million was provided to cater for 5,000 adults.</P>

        <P>The specific information requested by the Deputy is not available. However, at primary level there are now approximately 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. Indeed, one out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. At second level, there are approximately 1,600 whole time equivalent resource teachers in place to support pupils with special educational needs. This compares to approximately 200 teachers that were in place in the 1997-98 school year for such pupils.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on resource teaching and SNAs, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appro<Col N="746"/>priate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.</P>

        <P>I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those in the area referred to by the Deputy, receive the support they require, when and where they require it.</P>

	<P>My Department makes a specific ex-quota allocation of teaching posts in respect of <Col N="747"/>guidance to schools in the second level system. This allocation is based on the pupil enrolment in September of the preceding school year. As a result of my decision to allocate an additional 100 posts to guidance from September 2005 an enhanced guidance allocation provision was put in place for 2005-06 school year. This enhanced provision means that in the case of schools in the free education-block grant schemes, the level of allocation ranges from eight hours per week for schools with enrolments below 200 pupils to 47 hours per week for schools with an enrolment of 1,000 pupils or more. In addition certain schools had previously been allocated hours in response to particular needs and-or as part of the guidance enhancement initiative, such schools have been permitted to retain this higher allocation for the 2005-06 school year.</P>
        <P>In the case of schools outside the free education or block grant schemes, 11 hours per week are allocated in respect of schools in the 350-499 enrolment category and a full post is allocated in the case of schools with 500 or more pupils.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the particular need for guidance at junior cycle, my Department has asked that schools should, as far as possible, utilise the additional guidance allocation granted under these new arrangements to focus on guidance provision at junior cycle.</P>
        <P>My Department has allocated a total of 10.84 wholetime teacher equivalents for the 2005-06 school year for the provision of guidance to the following post-primary schools in the Clondalkin and Lucan areas: Moyle Park College, Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de, St. Josephs College, Col&aacute;iste Ph&aacute;draig CBS, Collinstown Park Community College, Deansrath Community College and St. Kevin&rsquo;s Community College.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 509 to 511, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Since Ireland took part in its first United Nations mission in 1958, Defence Forces personnel have performed approximately 54,000 tours of duty on 58 peace support operations worldwide. Because UN peacekeepers operate in strife-torn regions, practically every officer, NCO and private who has served overseas has been exposed to the hostile events of one sort or another.</P>
        <P>While I fully appreciate that the experiences in the Congo were particularly distressing, it is also the case that many other members of the Defence Forces who have served overseas have been involved in serious and disturbing incidents where death and severe injury have resulted. This is in no way intended to denigrate the distress suffered by those involved. Rather, it is to indicate that service in a war-torn region inevitably exposes members of the Defence Forces to the possibility of involvement in incidents of a very serious and distressing nature.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces award bravery and distinguished service medals in exceptional circumstances. Cases for the award of such medals are examined in great detail having regard to the circumstances pertaining in each particular case and on the basis of comparison with previous similar awards. In 1962 a military board considered the various cases presented following action in the Congo, including the Niemba ambush, and made its recommendations. At that time, 22 cases were made for the award of the military medal for gallantry and only one such medal was awarded.</P>
        <P>In the case of the distinguished service medal, a military board was convened in 1965 where 120 cases were made for this award and of those, only 24 were awarded. Clearly, such medals are only awarded only in rare and exceptional circumstances and the number of personnel recom<Col N="750"/>mended for the award of such medals is very small.</P>
        <P>There is no award in the Defence Forces for survivors of hostile action. If such an award were to be created, it would have to be extended to all members of the Defence Forces who suffered in a similar way. As I have indicated so many personnel who serve overseas are exposed to various degrees of hostile action, significant numbers would qualify for such an award.</P>
        <P>There are awards made to all personnel who serve on overseas missions, which aim to recognise the contribution made by the members of each contingent serving on the peacekeeping mission and the difficult circumstances in which they have to operate. In this regard, the personnel referred to have received both a United Nations medal, for their service in the Congo, awarded by the UN and the United Nations peacekeeping medal awarded by the Irish Government.</P>

        <P>The question of future developments at Nenagh Castle and its grounds and environs, including 35/36 Pearse Street is under continuing appraisal.

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, required each member state to introduce regulations providing for a producer funded take-back scheme for consumers of end-of-life equipment from 13 August 2005. This directive covers a wide range of equipment from large business equipment, such as large refrigeration units, down to the smallest of consumer products such as pocket calculators and the like.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the directive the funding of such take-back schemes is a producer responsibility. The directive also requires the achievement by member states of specified targets for recovery, reuse and recycling by producers of different classes of WEEE.</P>
        <P>A fundamental aim of the directive is to ensure that the cost of recycling electronic and electrical equipment is built into the product price in the same way as the raw material costs of steel and plastic etc., manufacturing, distribution and sale. However, the directive also recognises that, for a number of years to come, a significant proportion of the waste arising in this area will be what is <Col N="753"/>termed &ldquo;historic WEEE&rdquo; i.e. products which were originally sold before the directive came into effect. Current producers must bear the cost of recycling this waste regardless of the identity of the original producer. Under the directive, producers are allowed, for a transitional period of eight years, ten years for large household appliances, to show purchasers, at the time of sale of new products, the costs of collection, treatment and disposal of historic WEEE in an environmentally sound manner, by means of visible environmental management costs, EMCs.</P>
        <P>The Waste Management (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations 2005 which fully transpose the WEEE directive in Ireland were introduced following two public consultations: the first of these followed publication of the WEEE task force report in April 2004, and the second followed publication of draft regulations in April 2005. Extensive discussion took place with representatives of producers, importers and retailers of electrical and electronic goods in Ireland. While there were varying opinions on how the provisions on the historic waste should operate, the majority view among the industry, for reasons of fuller transparency and greater accountability, favoured a system of visible EMCs in the manner which has been provided for under the regulations. The design of the new system assures the public that the moneys collected for recycling are actually assigned for recycling activity and are not diverted elsewhere. It also ensures traceability and financial accountability and, by informing the public in an open way, ensures that profiteering is prevented.</P>
        <P>Visible EMCs are designed solely to cover the cost of recycling of WEEE. None of the revenue involved is handled by the Government. The WEEE Register Society Limited, the industry-based national WEEE registration body, will monitor the implementation of the scheme and adjust the visible environmental management costs periodically to ensure that the not-for-profit principle is observed and that the visible environmental management costs only covers the costs incurred in the environmentally sound management of WEEE. The EMCs which have been validated by the WEEE Register Society are set out in the appended table.</P>
        <P>Producers pay the appropriate EMCs into the producer recycling funds operated by the two approved collective compliance schemes operating in Ireland; WEEE Ireland and the European recycling platform. As part of their approvals, each collective compliance scheme undertook to conduct audits and provide an annual report together with a statement of accounts.</P>
        <P>Prices generally are falling in the electrical and electronic sectors and this trend is expected to continue. Even in areas where there are price pressures &mdash; due to low margins and high <Col N="754"/>recycling costs &mdash; particularly the white goods area, consumers are benefiting now under the WEEE directive by availing of free recycling services which did not exist before the 13 August. Visible environmental management costs are input costs and how these are dealt with in the pricing of products is part of the normal negotiations between producer and retailer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To put the overall impact of the WEEE directive in context, it is estimated that the total cost of recycling waste equipment under the new scheme is around &euro;14 million in an industry of in excess of &euro;1.4 billion annually. The recycling services operated under the scheme are now being utilised by an increasing number of consumers at a considerable saving to them compared to previous waste disposal costs. Since 13 August this includes the free take back of WEEE at local authority collection facilities.</P>
        <P>Electric and electronic goods have been identified internationally as a problematic and potentially hazardous waste stream. Ireland has moved quickly in support of EU co-ordinated action in this area. While there has been criticism in this House in the past over delays in transposing EU directives, we can take pride that Ireland is one of only a small number of member states which have fully implemented this directive by the due date. </P>

	<P>The regulations transposing the EU directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, WEEE, in the State impose obligations on persons who supply electrical and electronic equipment to the Irish market. They are based largely on the principle of producer responsibility. Producers have an obligation to: finance the environmentally sound management of WEEE; ensure that WEEE is stored and treated in accordance with specified standards; achieve minimum recovery and recycling targets; maintain records; register with the WEEE Register Society Ltd., the industry based registration body; provide details in accordance with the regulations to enable each producer&rsquo;s share to be determined; ensure that each and every product they place on the market is marked visibly and permanently with the crossed out wheeled-bin symbol as required by the directive; provide specified information to users of their products, and to recovery facilities; submit waste management plans and reports to the EPA; through their product design, take account of and facilitate the re-use, recovery and recycling of the components and materials in their products when they become WEEE. Producers can meet some of these obligations by participating satisfactorily in a collective compliance scheme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, as amended, enables local authorities to grant shared ownership leases, and permits the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make regulations governing the operation of the scheme. No regulations have been made to date. However, the income limits for eligibility for a local authority housing loan to purchase by way of shared ownership and the maximum loan available are reviewed regularly and changes made by statutory instrument from time to time. These are notified to local authorities by way of circular letter.</P>
        <P>The administration of the shared ownership scheme, including selection of the housing units, is a matter for individual local authorities. Accordingly, it is open to a local authority to limit the sale of houses by way of shared ownership to those provided under its affordable housing scheme.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Waste Management (Farm Plastics) Regulations 2001, producers &mdash; i.e. manufacturers and importers &mdash; of farm plastics, silage bale wrap and sheeting, are required to take steps to recover farm plastics waste which they have placed on the market or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes to recover the waste in question. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is currently the sole approved body in Ireland for the purposes of implementing a compliance scheme for the recovery of farm plastics waste.</P>
        <P>Under the IFFPG scheme, producers apply a levy on the sale of farm plastics that in turn is transferred to the IFFPG for use in funding the collection and recovery of farm plastics waste. The IFFPG is a not-for-profit organisation and it is a matter for the company, under the terms of this producer responsibility initiative and in accordance with the polluter pays principle, to set a rate of levy which will cover its operational costs.</P>
        <P>The scheme has operated successfully to date. It is estimated that around 8,500 tonnes, circa 55%, of farm plastics placed on the market in 2004 were collected for recycling. An estimated 55,000 farmers availed of the collection service in 2004. IFFPG estimate that over 12,500 tonnes of farm plastics have been collected in 2005. While responsibility for the collection and recovery of farm plastics rests with the compliance scheme, my Department monitors the scheme on an ongoing basis. I am aware of the specific issues raised in relation to the operation of the scheme. Discussions are taking place involving my Department and IFFPG to explore options for improvement to the scheme and resolution of outstanding issues.</P>

        <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent report by the Centre for Public Inquiry (details supplied).</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 525 and 531 together.</P>
        <P>I have received a copy of the report referred to. It deals with a case, of a kind frequently instanced in Ireland&rsquo;s active economy, of competition between the public interest values of development and conservation. There is no pre-ordained or simple solution to such conflicting considerations. It is the function of the physical planning system to consider all factors and interests arising on planning applications in light of relevant provisions of local development plan, and to make a fair and reasonable determination in each case.</P>
        <P>This process operated transparently, and with access for third parties, in the development at Trim which was the subject of the report referred to in the question.</P>
        <P>The original planning permission for the hotel development in question in Trim was approved by Trim Town Council in August 2003. A modified planning approval was given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la at a later stage. The planning system is designed to produce decisions, under the responsibility of local planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which are taken on the basis of procedures and policy considerations recognised in legislation. The fact that planning decisions are not subsequently welcomed by all parties does not detract from the integrity of the process. The report does not offer evidence that the planning process operated other than properly in the Trim case.</P>
        <P>The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is one of a number of statutory consultees in relation to planning cases having implications for the built or natural heritage. The then Minister&rsquo;s observations on this case were made following consideration of all relevant issues. The fact that these observations involved amendment of draft proposals submitted by departmental officials is not unreasonable in terms of the Minister&rsquo;s legal and political accountability for the matters involved; and it has parallels in the practice of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities, as occasion requires, in amending draft proposals submitted by their staff.</P>
        <P>The report refers to a complaint to the European Commission&rsquo;s Environment Directorate that the hotel development was not subject to an environmental impact assessment. My Depart<Col N="760"/>ment has formally responded to the European Commission on this matter.</P>
        <P>The former Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands paid Trim Town Council a contribution of &euro;63,487, £50,000, in June 2000 towards the provision of car park facilities at the site of the hotel development which would cater, <i>inter alia</i>, for visitor traffic. In light of subsequent changed plans by Trim Town Council in relation to the procurement and financing of the project and the fact that a permanent car park has not been provided, my Department requested the repayment of this contribution in January 2005. In doing so, my Department made it clear that it was not reflecting on the judgement of the local authority in pursuing a development led solution to the provision of the car park. My Department has recently contacted the local authority about the repayment and expects that this will be concluded shortly.</P>

        <Quest>if his Department encourages a policy of transference of tenancy to sub-tenants of local authority housing, where such sub-tenants are family members of the original tenants; and if a record is kept of such transfers that might be kept in a given year.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of succession to tenancies by family members living in a local authority dwelling is entirely a matter for local authorities to be decided in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities. The guidelines issued by my Department to local authorities indicate that a scheme of letting priorities should normally contain provisions to allow, subject to appropriate conditions, succession by family members living in a dwelling in the case of death or departure of a tenant. My Department does not obtain statistics from local authorities on the number of succession tenancies each year at local level.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the question refers to radioactive material which was stored on Rocky Island and which was exported to the US in March 2004. The radioactive material had been detected in some supplies of radioactively contaminated scrap steel deliv<Col N="761"/>ered to the Irish Ispat steel plant in Haulbowline during the 1990s. Following detection, the radioactive content was removed and stored in the Irish Ispat store at Rocky Island.</P>
        <P>The radioactive material was subsequently exported to the US in March 2004, the cost of which was borne by the Irish Ispat Liquidator. The cost of this was a matter for the liquidator of Irish Ispat. I understand from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that there is no residual radioactive contamination following the export of the material to the U.S.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 529 and 530 together.</P>
        <P>Since 2000 local authorities have operated their housing construction programmes on the basis of a four-year multi-annual allocation of house starts for the period 2000 to 2003. This replaced the system of individual annual house start allocations in operation prior to 2000. Information on the number of authorised starts allocated to each <Col N="762"/>local authority under the 2000 to 2003 multi-annual programme is set out in the accompanying table.</P>
        <P>Multi-annual action plans have been prepared by local authorities for the provision of social and affordable housing for the period 2004 to 2008. These have been approved by my Department and are designed to assist local authorities in identifying priority needs over the coming years and providing a coherent and co-ordinated response across all housing services, including delivery of housing by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</P>
        <P>Detailed information on the number of local authority house starts and completions and output by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector by local authority for the years 2000 to 2004 is available in the annual housing statistics bulletins published by my Department, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas library. These figures, along with the figures for the first six months of 2005, are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.</P>

	<P>The Killybegs sewerage scheme has been approved for construction under my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2004 to 2006, at an estimated cost of &euro;17.2 million. Donegal County Council&rsquo;s preliminary report for the scheme is under examination in my Department and is being dealt with as quickly as possible. The council will be in a position to proceed with the preparation of contract documents when the preliminary report is approved.</P>

	<P>Donegal County Council submitted preliminary outline proposals to my Department in June 2005 for funding under my Department&rsquo;s remedial works scheme to undertake refurbishment work to a significant number of local authority houses in the county including a small number of such houses at that particular location.</P><Col N="765"/>
        <P>Given the significant number of proposals submitted by the council, my Department recently requested the authority to prioritise its proposals on the basis of schemes which require urgent and substantial refurbishment work. The council was also requested to provide my Department with detailed schedules and costings for the proposed works following identification by the council of the priority schemes. It is not clear, at this stage, if all of the proposals submitted to my Department qualify for funding under the remedial works scheme. The council&rsquo;s response is awaited.</P>

	<P>I assume that the question refers to Russell Square, Tallaght, a joint venture development between South Dublin County Council and Kelland Homes Limited. who jointly owned the land. My Department was informed by South Dublin County Council some time ago that the complex legal issues associated with this development had been concluded and that this would allow the houses to be occupied. Following inquiries made more recently to the council, my Department has been informed that of the 100 affordable units involved, all are now sold and 44 are actually occupied. The purchasers of the remaining affordable units are, I understand, finalising the normal legal requirements associated with house purchase.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 545 together.</P>
        <P>Ongoing contact through correspondence and meetings at ministerial, official and expert level is <Col N="766"/>being maintained with the UK authorities regarding a range of issues in relation to the Sellafield nuclear plant. These contacts are productive and reflect an increasing recognition by the UK Government of the serious concerns held by the Irish Government in relation to Sellafield. There remains, however, a significant difference of views between the Irish and UK Governments regarding the continued operation of Sellafield. The UK response to concerns raised by Ireland is that operations at Sellafield are safe and do not adversely impact on the environment. This Government holds a significantly different view and has at every opportunity expressed this view directly to the UK Government and its relevant authorities at all levels.</P>
        <P>The incident at the THORP facility earlier this year is a case in point. While officials from my Department were advised about this incident by their UK counterparts in accordance with the established co-ordination and co-operation procedures between the two countries, this was a very serious incident. I will be meeting the UK Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, Alan Johnson MP, later this month in London where I intend not only to raise this issue but also to reiterate Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on Sellafield and the nuclear industry generally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to contacts with ministerial colleagues, my officials and scientific experts from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland continue to meet with their UK counterparts on a regular basis during which Ireland&rsquo;s concerns regarding operations at Sellafield are raised. The institute&rsquo;s visit to the Sellafield facility in September 2004 was no exception and I was pleased to attend the launch of a very comprehensive report on the visit last April. Furthermore, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na visited the facility in June 2004 and, as with the institute, the UK has undertaken to facilitate further such visits in the future. Finally, my Department continues to participate in the numerous consultative fora instigated by various UK departments and their agencies regarding nuclear issues. My policy is to use the consultation processes to articulate the views of the Irish Government in relation to nuclear issues and to ensure Ireland&rsquo;s interests are represented and protected. My officials have consistently impressed upon the UK that Ireland, as a unique stakeholder, has a significant interest in the nuclear issues under deliberation in the United Kingdom. The recently published UK nuclear decommissioning authority&rsquo;s draft strategy is under consideration by departmental officials and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. A briefing for Irish officials by the UK on the draft strategy is planned for later this month and my Department will submit its comments on the draft strategy to the authority shortly thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While decisions regarding attendance at conferences are a matter for local elected members, the Local Government Act 2001 requires an elected council to be satisfied, <i>inter alia</i>, that such attendance is in the general interest of its administrative area and the local community and the rules, regulations and directions associated with conference attendance are designed to reflect this. In these circumstances, I would not consider it appropriate for fees or expenses to be paid by local authorities in respect of attendance by elected members at any conference, seminar, workshop or similar event organised by a political party. Such attendance would be a matter for the individual or party concerned and the payment of expenses from public funds would not be warranted.</P>
        <P>I have written to the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authority Members Association advising them of my views on this matter. In addition, my Department has written to county and city managers informing them that attendance at conferences organised by any political party should not receive local authority funding.</P>

	<P>The provision of a fire service, including appliances and equipment, is a matter for the local fire authority. My Department assists local fire authorities in providing funding for the purchase of fire appliances and rescue equipment. The building regulations 1997 to 2002 set down functional requirements for fire safety in high-rise buildings and technical guidance document B, issued under the building regulations provides guidance on how to meet these requirements. This guidance is prepared on the basis that the occupants of any part of such a building should be able to escape safely from the building in an emergency without external assistance. Therefore, these buildings must be designed so that people can safely evacuate and fire fighters can enter without relying on external aerial appliances.</P>

	<P>The European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2000, which transposed Council Directive 98/83/EC, reduced the parametric value for lead in drinking water from 50 micrograms per litre under the previous directive to 10 micrograms per litre. A December 2013 deadline is specified for achieving compliance with this new standard, with an interim value of 25 micrograms per litre required since the end of 2003. Compliance with the interim standard is generally achievable through appropriate treatment at water treatment plants.</P>
        <P>Proposals regarding a recommended sampling method for lead, which will inform future plans in this area, are awaited from the European Commission. However, in the meantime, limited sampling of houses in Dublin, known to have lead services, was carried out in 1996. From this survey it is estimated that up to 80% of these premises would be in compliance with the 2013 standard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 542, 543 and 546 together.</P>
        <P>The product in question, genetically modified oilseed rape GT73, was authorised by the European Commission on 31 August 2005 for importation into the European Community for use as animal feed and for industrial use.</P>
        <P>Article 23 of Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council specifies the conditions under which the safeguard clause, prohibiting in a national territory a GMO approved for use in the EU, may be invoked. These conditions include the emergence of new or additional information made available since the date of the consent and affecting the environmental risk assessment or the reassessment of existing information on the basis of new or additional scientific knowledge which provide detailed grounds for considering that the product constitutes a risk to human health or the environment. Such conditions have not been fulfilled in relation to the product in question and, accordingly it would not be appropriate to seek to ban the importation of oilseed rape GT73.</P>
        <P>I am also advised that oilseed rape imported into this country is processed prior to its importation by crushing, and its oil extracted. This minimises the possibility of live seed entering the environment.</P>

        <P>The financial allocations to local authorities in 2004 for their housing construction and acquisition programmes took account of authorities&rsquo; proposed housing starts and their contractual commitments on schemes under construction at the beginning of 2004. Detailed information on the number of local authority house starts and completions in 2004 and for the first six months of 2005 is available in the quarterly and annual housing statistics bulletins published by my Department, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie.</i> The total 2005 outputs will be available in the 2006 annual housing statistics bulletin and on the Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.environ.ie. </i>At this stage it is anticipated that the number of houses completed or acquired by local authorities in 2005 will be in excess of the 2004 level of output.</P>
