        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the steps she is taking to secure a derogation for Irish farmers from the nitrates directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In October last Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland delivered in March 2004.</P>
        <P>Subsequently my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April and I understand <Col N="1170"/>a revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, will be sent to the Commission shortly.</P>
        <P>Ireland submitted proposals for a derogation in November 2004 in parallel with the action programme. The proposals are designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. Developed by my Department and Teagasc in consultation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the proposals set out a scientific justification for the higher operating levels based on the specific characteristics of Irish agriculture. While the Commission has stated it will not consider the application for a derogation until the action programme is agreed and in place, I am hopeful for a favourable outcome. My objective is and has been to minimise the burden of compliance which must be placed on farmers in implementing the nitrates directive and safeguard the future of commercial farming.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the proposals submitted to Brussels, the nitrates directive is to be implemented as and from 1 January next. Is the Minister confident a derogation will be in place by 1 January? What will be the implications if a derogation is not in place by that date? Is she aware it could take 12 months to introduce a derogation given the procedures involved? What steps have she and her colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, taken to ensure all the scientific evidence required will be made available?</P>
        <P>What steps have been taken to comply with the water framework directive given that the derogation will be framed as part of this directive rather than the nitrates directive? Has a complete and accurate assessment been done on the quality of our ground water given that the review of the derogation in four years will be based on improvements achieved in our ground water?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As it is not within my competence to carry out an assessment of ground water, I suggest the Deputy table a question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Farmers will carry the can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree. We are cognisant of the water framework directive as is reflected in our work on the nitrates directive which takes into consideration the implications of the framework directive. It would be preferable to deal with both directives simultaneously rather than revisiting them at a later date.</P>
        <P>With regard to the derogation I am confident and hopeful that we will achieve a favourable outcome. As the Deputy is aware, however, the Commission has decided it will not negotiate on the issue until the nitrates action plan has been <Col N="1171"/>progressed. I hope we will be able to address that issue quickly. The Deputy is correct it is an important issue which has major implications for intensive farming enterprises. I am anxious that we pursue the matter vigorously. We must also be cognisant of the implications of the nitrates action plan. The evidence has been compiled by Teagasc and the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agriculture and Food, in consultation with the county councils, on the scientific basis for requesting a derogation of 250 kilogrammes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The derogation will involve a complex nutrient management system for those farmers who will have to put it in place. Would it not have been easier to seek a derogation had we started to implement the nitrates action plan already? What are the implications of the 1 January implementation date if we do not have a derogation in place from 1 January 2006?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We must be positive on the basis that a derogation is tremendously important to the farming community and there will be serious issues if we are not in a position to secure it. The Commission is not happy with the way things have been done and it wants a nitrates action plan agreed that should be rolled out as quickly as possible. I cannot pre-empt the view of the Commission on the derogation but it is acutely aware, as is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of its huge importance.</P>
        <P>I am confident we will be able to work within the timeframe that has been set down in legislation. The nitrates action plan will not be in place instantly on 1 January next year because we require a lead-in period to deal with the issues that are part of the plan. On the basis of the work that has been done in the Department, we are aware of the implications and have prepared a substantial scientific proposal on the derogation. We will be working vigorously on that once the discussions with the Commission on the nitrates action plan have been completed.</P>

        <asker>Dr. Upton</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to reports that the national task force on obesity will call on her Department to practice positive discrimination towards local producers of fresh food and that there should be a national, regularly reviewed code of conduct for the food industry; if she has received either a final report or a draft; her views on the calls made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14244/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>The national task force on obesity has not produced a report either in final or draft form. The World Health <Col N="1172"/>Organisation has described obesity as a worldwide epidemic, and estimates that up to 250 million people, about 7% of the adult population, may have an obesity problem. In Ireland figures point to a two thirds increase in the prevalence of obesity among adults. Particularly worrying is the emergence of obesity in children.</P>
        <P>The main cause of obesity appears to be an imbalance between energy intake and physical activity. As with other public health problems, societal and lifestyle changes are contributory factors. Sedentary lifestyles, longer commuting times and time pressures are some factors in reducing the average level of physical activity. Food and eating occasions are readily available and convenience has favoured the regular consumption of fast food and prepared foods. There is, however, some demand for a range of healthy convenience options and the orientation of the Common Agricultural Policy away from production subsidies will make the agrifood sector more responsive to market changes and opportunities.</P>
        <P>My Department, while not directly represented on the task force, made a comprehensive submission. The submission set out in detail the Department&rsquo;s mission and the role and responsibilities that it undertakes to lead the sustainable development of a competitive, consumer focused agrifood sector and to contribute to a vibrant rural economy and society. Key among our priorities are food safety and quality, market development and ensuring compliance with the EU and national requirements in this area. The national development plan provides for research grants to companies and for public good research into food safety, new and innovative products, advanced technologies and consumer foods.</P>
        <P>The task force subsequently asked for comments on three draft recommendations that it was considering. One raised issues to do with transport and planning, which fall outside the remit of my Department. The second proposed that my Department support and encourage farmers to sell their healthy produce to local disadvantaged communities at affordable prices. This implies a <i>de facto</i> price subsidy that is not permissible under EU state aid rules.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>The third draft recommendation was that my Department should support the implementation of evidence-based healthy eating interventions. I support this approach. My Department has been to the forefront in research and the public good food institutional research measure has financed a number of dietary and nutritional surveys, including the second SL&Aacute;N survey, which previewed the national task force on obesity.</P>
        <P>I am not aware that the task force intends to recommend that my Department discriminate in favour of local producers but any such recommendation would have to be considered very <Col N="1173"/>carefully in light of state aid rules. Any code of conduct for the food industry that goes beyond the regulatory requirements would be a matter for the industry itself.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia has been effective in promoting the nutritional benefits of a balanced diet and of increased consumption of horticultural products. Its market information, advice and promotion services for the food industry draw on analyses of changing consumer demand and lifestyle trends in different population segments. Bord Bia has a proposal under consideration for EU and national funding for an extended pilot &ldquo;Food Dudes&rdquo; programme targeted at primary school children over the next three years. The programme encourages children aged four to 11 to taste a variety of fruit and vegetables. Research has shown that this programme is very effective in encouraging children to form a lifelong habit of eating fruit and vegetables. Development of good eating habits is one means of combating obesity.</P>
        <P>I await with great interest the outcome of the work of the task force on obesity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. When the obesity task force was established, I was disappointed the Department of Agriculture and Food was not formally represented on it. It is a grave omission because the Department&rsquo;s input would have been highly significant in the promotion of healthy, good quality and home-produced foods. Will the Minister of State agree it is important for the Department to be represented on the task force rather than making submissions to it?</P>
        <P>We tend to equate fast and convenience foods with being non-nutritious and unhealthy. It may be true to a certain extent as many of them have high fat and salt content. Why is no serious effort made to ensure fast and convenience foods can be nutritious and healthy? These two terms should not be incompatible. What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on the promotion of such foods?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Scientists have replaced the saturated fat, salt and sugar components in convenience foods as consumption of natural healthy food ingredients continues to increase, resulting in healthier products. Under the food institutional research programme, considerable work has been undertaken at Teagasc&rsquo;s National Food Centre and University College Cork in developing those types of foods as referred to by Deputy Upton. Within the umbrella of the Irish Universities Nutritional Alliance, a major survey was conducted on adult eating patterns. This work is important in ensuring further research can be carried out to develop the products to which the Deputy referred. The research of food products suitable for coeliacs was a result of the ongoing work of University College Cork and Teagasc&rsquo;s National Food Centre.</P><Col N="1174"/>
        <P>The Department made detailed submissions to the task force, whose work is well under way. The different agencies working for the Department of Agriculture and Food, such as Bord Bia, are involved in advanced research, particularly in changes to food consumption trends. Over several years, the food dude programme was particularly successful. Although it was a British initiative, it was piloted in Ireland. We have applied to the EU for permission to establish another food dude programme. The results of the first programme were encouraging. One year after it, children&rsquo;s eating habits were surveyed. Those who had been on the programme had a significantly higher intake of fruit and vegetables than those who did not partake. There are merits in continuing the food dude programme. Bord Bia, working with the Department, is anxious to advance this as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The annual cost of obesity here is estimated at &euro;370 million, a huge cost in ill health, cardiovascular diseases and so forth. Will Bord Bia increase its promotion of fruit and vegetables considering it was amalgamated with An Bord Glas last year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and that work is ongoing. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has been anxious to make the public aware at every available forum that we will drive this agenda. The labelling issue comes into this too. We are making considerable progress on this issue.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if, in view of the fact that 102,000 farmers are receiving disadvantage payments, no change will take place and the <i>status quo</i> will apply; if she will defend all areas designated; if funding for disadvantaged areas will be increased in line with inflation; if pockets of areas which meet natural handicap criteria but were excluded due to not being adjacent to existing areas will now be included under natural handicap criteria; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14245/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the post-2006 rural development framework provides for the reclassification of disadvantaged areas. It responds to the European Court of Auditors criticism, endorsed by the European Parliament, concerning the system. The suggested new methodology will be based on natural conditions, notably soil and climatic factors. The socio-economic criteria, taken into account to designate eligible areas, will no longer apply.</P>
        <P>At meetings of the Council of Ministers, I have stressed that reclassification is an extremely important and sensitive issue. Other member states have adopted a similar position. I will con<Col N="1175"/>tinue to seek a solution that is equitable and in Ireland&rsquo;s interests. I cannot yet be definite regarding the shape of that solution, since negotiations are still in progress. However, the negotiations to date give me grounds for cautious optimism. Regarding the issue of funding, that too is covered by the EU Commission proposal for the post-2006 rural development framework. Negotiations on that have not yet begun in earnest but I assure the Deputy I will be seeking a solution which is fair and in the best interests of our disadvantaged areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the Minister hails from Donegal, where there are small farmers such as in County Clare, I do not need to tell her of the hardship which will befall them if the disadvantaged area is declassified. It will reduce their incomes considerably. The introduction of the nitrates directive will further reduce their incomes and stocking rates, while the beef premium overshoot of &euro;18 million will also cause hardship for farmers. I ask the Minister to do her best to ensure there is no reclassification of disadvantaged areas in this country.</P>
        <P>Can the Minister veto the declassification? Over what timescale does the Minister expect it to take place? If the current situation is maintained, will the Minister guarantee index linking, so payments will rise with the rate of inflation? This is important for farmers. The Minister and the two Ministers of State in the Department are aware that we cannot afford to allow declassification to take place.</P>
        <P>The Minister is fighting to maintain live exports of cattle. If they are not maintained, small farmers will be put out of business. The Minister sees the importance of this. I remind Deputy Naughten that I am the biggest small farmer in County Clare, by size only.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Deputy that this is an important area. I expected Deputy Crawford to jump up and thank the Minister and the Minister of State for including Monaghan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I was telling him to keep quiet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is terrible to be successful on occasion on this side of the House. I know the Ceann Comhairle is above politics but he would welcome that.</P>
        <P>Deputy Breen is correct. A considerable portion of his constituency in County Clare lies in a disadvantaged area. This is a politically sensitive issue. We are currently in quite difficult negotiations on the issue. A number of my colleagues will suffer huge losses as a consequence of the re-evaluation taking place, and as the Deputy will appreciate, that is politically unacceptable to them. We are back into the melting pot. The Deputy is correct in saying that any degressivity of removal of the disadvantaged payments will <Col N="1176"/>have major implications. All of this depends on the financial perspectives which are to be negotiated and finalised in June. We expect this matter to be concluded by the end of June, during the negotiations at the Council of Ministers.</P>
        <P>I agree that the issue is of major importance, and we will make every effort to ensure the outcome will not be disadvantageous to Irish farmers.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>when she will announce increased grant aid for the provision of increased slurry capacity based on the number of weeks farmers will have to provide for under the new nitrates directive; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that time is of the essence, if farmers are to have slurry accommodation available for October 2005 and that they need approval immediately; if she has made any provision for grant aid to those with under 20 livestock units; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14267/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is aware of the consultations in progress with the EU Commission regarding the implementation in Ireland of the nitrates directive. He is also aware of the substantial increases in grants for farm waste management introduced last year. Sustaining Progress allowed for improvements to be made to the grants available under the farm waste management scheme and this commitment was achieved by the introduction of a revised farm waste management scheme in January 2004. Consideration of further amendments to the scheme must await resolution of the nitrates programme discussions with the EU. As for applying the grant aid to those with under 20 income units, this has been traditionally opposed by the Commission when sought on previous occasions, but I intend raising the matter again in these new circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister advise when the nitrates directive will be agreed? This situation is causing major distress for farmers who do not know what they must do. The Government has proposed to Brussels that counties Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan have a 22-week storage period. Will farmers in those counties get the extra grant that is required? This is justified given that in counties such as Cork there is only a 16-week storage period. This is a major issue. These people must plan for this. They wish to co-operate but they need an indication that grants will be at a realistic level to ensure they can afford to remain in business.</P>
        <P>Is it correct that the under-20 stock unit can be decided by the member state? If the under-20 units cannot get grant aid, it will be the end of many small farmers in western areas.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1177"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree the four counties with the 22-week requirement have a problem. In counties Monaghan and Cavan there are the additional issues of pigs and poultry. I have had an opportunity, with the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, to meet the Border regional authority, the producers and the national representatives. I have a major concern about this. I agree there is a special case to be made for those four counties. The capacity problem is causing great concern but we should be able to deal with it. My concern is that for some poultry producers the problem is not capacity, given that many of them have the 26 weeks, but access to spread lands. That is a major concern and we are examining innovative ways of dealing with this organic waste. There is a strong case to be made for the producers in those four counties.</P>
        <P>I can only offer a guess on when finality will be brought to this issue but I believe it will be this month. From a practical point of view, if we are to implement something, we must have the time to do so, no matter what happens. If capacity must be increased, planning permission will be required and funding and building arrangements will have to be made. There are many things to be done and that takes time. Although people are anxious and some are overly anxious, we must keep steady heads. We will certainly look more favourably at the farmers with the 22-week requirement although we will not neglect other producers who also have a difficulty.</P>
        <P>The 20 livestock units issue is a European matter. It is unfortunate. There is a view that such holdings are not viable farming enterprises. The directive has nothing to do with that; it is about water quality. It does not matter if one has two cows or 200, this is a water quality issue. I will put forward the view to the Commission that we must address the water quality issues, not the income viability of farming enterprises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment on the under 20 units issue and I will be glad to support her in dealing with it. However, I seek clearer information on extra grant aid for the four counties concerned because they must provide a higher level of storage. Farmers must have some indication. A total of 75 dairy farmers in County Monaghan have left the business this year before the introduction of this directive. That indicates the desperation among farmers.</P>

      <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give an indication at present about grant aid. This is a matter of negotiation between me, the Department of Finance and the social partners. There is a particularly special case to be made for those who have a 22-week requirement. Equally, there is a case to be made for intensive commercial producers, particularly dairy producers in the south, who also have a problem, although not to the same extent as producers in the four counties mentioned.</P><Col N="1178"/>
        <P>The Deputy can rest assured that in a re-evaluation of grant aid and support, the four counties will be uppermost in our minds. The IFA has fired its first shot, seeking aid of 100%. That is unrealistic.</P>

        <Quest>if she will report on the implementation of recommendations in the organic development report; the acreage of organically farmed land in 1989, 1994, 1999 and 2004 in each EU member state; the action she is taking to remove the impediments to organic conversion for farmers; and the locations at which farmers can benefit from training to farm organically.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Substantial progress has been made on the implementation of the recommendations in the organic development committee report. All three additional structures recommended have been established. A national steering group was set up to act as a driving force for the development of the organic sector and as a basis for advancing partnership between the organic sector and the other principal essential interests. It has met nine times. The steering group is supported by two sub-groups, the partnership expert working group and the organic market development group. The partnership expert working group is responsible for training, education, advice and research. The organic market development group has overall responsibility for developing a national marketing strategy for organic food.</P>
        <P>The main incentive to organic conversion for farmers is the rural environment protection scheme under which they get substantial payments. Almost &euro;4 million was paid under the scheme directly to organic farmers in 2004. Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered &euro;31 million to the sector. Under the current scheme, an organic farmer with 55 hectares is eligible for an annual payment in REPS 3 of &euro;18,505 a year for the first two years, and &euro;13,555 each year for the rest of his or her time in the scheme. As a further incentive to encourage conventional farmers to venture into organic production, REPS now allows them to convert part of the farm instead of the entire holding as previously.</P>
        <P>Teagasc offers five training modules in organic farming. Courses are planned at Kildalton, Athy, Bandon and Athenry. Courses will be provided at other centres when there is a demand.

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. It is now over five years since the agrifood 2010 committee recommended the setting up of the organic development committee so it is time to examine what progress has been made. The report predicted that by 2006 we would have at least 3% of agricultural land in organic production. Is it time to look again at the measures outlined by the Minister of State on the basis that the figures for other EU countries show considerable progress has been made elsewhere? For example, Austria has nearly 13% of land in organic production, it is over 7% in Finland, and over 6% in Denmark, Greece and Italy. This shows that something is being done in those countries which we are not doing. Can the Minister identify what they are doing that we are not doing, given the potential here which has not been fulfilled?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State revise the reply he gave to me last October when he said it is up to producers and consumers to determine whether the target is achieved? Does he not agree that 70% of organic food eaten in this country is imported, that this indicates that it is not simply a matter of leaving it up to consumers and producers and that a much more proactive targets-based policy needs to be adopted, which is the <Col N="1180"/>case in Austria? It is clear that such a policy works as Austria has 13% of land in organic production. Is it not time to look again at the policy and give us the potential which we would be capable of reaching were the Government in support of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>At present there are about 1,000 organic operators in Ireland and 30,000 hectares of land under organic production.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is less than 1%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>That is around 1%. In 1994 it was 5,000 hectares. As I outlined in my reply, there is substantial grant aid for farmers to become actively involved in organic production but they have not availed of this. When I talk to organic farmers, they point out that they find it difficult to get consumers to pay the price they seek for the production of organic foods.</P>
        <P>The organic committee that reported in 2003 recommended a number of structures, which have all been put in place. It also made a number of other recommendations, including a census of Irish organic production and work on a national label, which should be available shortly. The seven demonstration farms that were operation <Col N="1181"/>in 2004 are to be increased to 12. Teagasc has become nationally involved and has identified advisers at national level to work with farmers in the area of organic production.</P>
        <P>As regards the issues raised by the Deputy, we are certainly pursuing them within the Department. Grant aid has been made available and we have made changes in the REPS. Where previously a farmer had to devote his or her entire farm to organic production, now it only needs to be part of the farm. A vocational certificate in agriculture, with an organic option, is offered at Mountbellew College. However, because of the lack of interest by students, we are not in a position to make this viable at the moment. Other organisations are involved in training such as the Organic Centre, Rossinver, County Leitrim, an tIonad Glas, County Limerick, and the centre at Falcarragh, County Donegal. In my county there is the County Wexford partnership which is actively promoting organic farming. Every effort is made within the Department.</P>
        <P>The Department is always prepared to re-examine the situation. We are very much in favour of developing the organic sector and reaching the 3% target that the committee suggested should be achieved by 2006. I do not believe, however, that this is practicable.</P>

	<P>Prior to a brief supplementary question, I would like to welcome the national label initiative, and I hope it comes about shortly as it is long overdue. Does the Minister of State accept that it is necessary to review constantly the reasons Ireland does not maintain the progress made in other countries that have less to boast about in terms of their agricultural traditions? Does he regard the genetic modification situation as an impediment or threat to the development of the organic sector? Does he regard Teagasc as being sufficiently on board to assist smaller producers who are more likely to see the advantages of conversion and to be in a position to move to organic? It needs to focus more on the potential of smaller producers. Organic producers say that Teagasc is much more focused on larger producers and apparently is not that interested in small organic units. Will the Minister of State say whether Teagasc has its mindset correctly adjusted to ensure that organic potential is reached?</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Teagasc has identified advisers to work with farmers. It has also developed and delivered a number of organic courses for farmers and intends to expand in this area. In addition to the roll-out of organic education and advice, Teagasc is developing an organic beef research programme. It hopes to work closely with small producers and farmers who want to enter this area. Teagasc is very active in this area and I will encourage it to become even more active in the months ahead. It is important that we continue to debate this issue but, more importantly, that we encourage farmers to take up the substantial extra grant aid that exists under the REPS.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the continuing increase in the price of farm land identified by the Central Statistics Office, which is running considerably above the level of general inflation; her views on the implications of this rise for farmers who wish to expand or persons who wish to enter farming for the first time; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Low levels of land mobility have been a long-term feature of Irish farming. The substantial increase in land prices in recent years and the relatively small acreage that is placed on the market annually demonstrate that this situation has not changed. Agricultural land prices have increased by almost 300% from &euro;4,967 per hectare in 1993 to &euro;14,379 per hectare in 2003, the latest figure available. In addition, both the volume of land available for purchase and the average parcel of land sold has decreased significantly. The increase in price reflects a combination of a shortage of land on the market and increasing levels of demand from both agricultural and non-agricultural purchasers. According to the Central Statistics Office, in recent years less than 0.2% of agricultural land has been placed on the open market for sale. The means by which land has changed ownership is through gift or inheritance within families.</P>
        <P>Irish farmers have responded to this by altering their behaviour. Rather than buying, they are now leasing the land they need to expand. The high cost of purchasing land has encouraged many farmers who wish to expand their enterprises or enter agriculture to opt for leased land. Almost one fifth of all agricultural land is leased, with one third of Irish farms leasing in some portion of land. For meaningful farm planning, leasing is best done on a long-term basis. The Government has a number of incentives in place to encourage this and to improve the overall levels of land mobility. To this end, my Department operates an early retirement pension for retiring farmers who dispose of land either by sale, transfer or long-term lease.</P>
        <P>There are generous income tax disregards for farmers who lease out land on a long-term basis. Lessors aged over 40 years of age can currently avail of annual exemption thresholds of up to &euro;7,500 for leases of five to seven years and up to &euro;10,000 for leases of seven years or more. This has undoubtedly encouraged the better utilisation of land and facilitates better long-term planning by farmers who wish to increase their scale of production at a reasonable cost without having to purchase. There is also a series of measures in place to help reduce start-up costs for new entrants. These include a number of generous <Col N="1183"/>grants and tax reliefs. For young, suitably trained farmers there are a number of attractive schemes, including an installation aid grant of &euro;9,520, 100% stamp duty relief on land, a 90% relief from capital acquisition tax and 100% stock relief for four years for eligible farmers.</P>
        <P>These are pragmatic solutions to allow those farmers who wish to do so to expand production. Anecdotal evidence points to further increases in land prices in recent times caused by the implementation of the Luxembourg Agreement and the financial platform to be provided by the single farm payment. The Government will continue to review its measures to improve land mobility and is always conscious of the need to encourage production farmers to be able to expand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Having such a small percentage of agricultural land being offered for sale is clearly one of the factors that will influence the price. Leasing the land is one of the options, as the Minister pointed out. The early retirement scheme is now in place and we have had long discussions recently on that. We would like to be assured that any retirement schemes in place will be appropriate to the needs of those people who opt for them.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister think that the installation grant, at &euro;9,250, is adequate given the high start up costs for farming? There are other reliefs as well, but the grant still seems a very small amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been an issue of considerable debate over the past few years. Macra na Feirme has been anxious to increase installation aid. It is an issue for review and consideration. I am concerned about the early retirement scheme. It is part of the rural development package and we have to see how much money will be made available for the next tranche of EU funding. However, we are trying to encourage most people to stay in employment until they reach 65, yet at the same time we are trying to encourage others to transfer land to allow younger people into farming. We need to develop a partnership approach where young people can be encouraged to take up farming while at the same time leaving 50 to 55 year old farmers in a position to farm adequately.</P>
        <P>The early retirement scheme is driving people crazy because it is not index linked, nor is any other scheme in Europe. When people get an entitlement to social welfare, they often do not realise that they must advise the Department of their eligibility. There are also issues with overpayments and so on. Early retirement was very important when self-employed people did not pay PRSI and did not pay into an adequate pension scheme. I am anxious that farmers get involved in private pension schemes as well as paying a PRSI contribution. We will have to look at this, although not in the short term because a new scheme is being introduced.</P><Col N="1184"/>
        <P>I do not know if we are doing the right thing by encouraging early retirement because that discourages people who are active and who might change their minds in a few years time. At the same time, we want to encourage young people to be part of a farming enterprise. We have considered partnerships with regard to milk production and they seem to work well. Perhaps we should look at the issue that way and reflect it in some of our taxation policies.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister circulate her initial response to the National Roads Authority because what that authority offers people for land purchased by CPO is a gross insult to them?</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of leasing, has the Minister had any discussions with her colleague, the Minister for Finance, regarding tax relief on intra-family leases? There is no exemption on these although the majority of transfers are on those lines. Has the Minister had any discussions with her colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, particularly as she is well up to speed in that area, regarding the existing restriction on people on a non-contributory old age pension who lease land? If they lease land, any income generated from that land causes a reduction in their old age pension. Therefore, there is no incentive for them to lease land.</P>
        <P>With regard to installation aid, in light of the fact that the cost of an industrial job here is far in excess of the approximately &euro;9,000 installation aid grant, will the Minister consider increasing that grant in line with grant aid for industrial jobs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of leasing and social welfare, it is better for a person to lease his or her land than to have it set down as a capital assessment. Even though the capital value was changed in last year&rsquo;s budget, it is always worth confirming that a leasing agreement is better from a non-contributory pension point of view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no financial incentive for leasing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the next few years, particularly when people begin to retire, they will get a contributory pension. I remember the Deputy raised this issue previously when I was in the Department of Social and Family Affairs and it did create some angst. The issue of leasing, particularly intra-family leasing, and changes from leasing agreements into partnership agreements appear to cause some bother. Much of this area has been fleshed out as a consequence of the single farm payment. As people cannot transfer their entitlement this year but must wait till next year, many leasing agreements are taking place. <Col N="1185"/>Many of the changes we see and the issues being raised at clinics reflect the changes taking place with the single farm payment. This is something we must evaluate from the taxation point of view in our discussions with the Minister.</P>
        <P>I agree there are issues that need further discussion with the Minister for Finance. He did much work regarding five issues we raised and agreed on them in the last budget. The implications and changes currently taking place will be, as issues always have been in Fianna F&aacute;il, reflected in the generous tax reliefs made available to the farming community.</P>

        <Quest>the plans she has to provide greater support for small farmers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am keenly aware of the need to make available appropriate supports for small farmers. In this regard, small farmers benefit from all of the supports, within the legal framework of the European Union, administered by my Department. One of the areas where this is possible is the rural environment protection scheme. The latest version of the scheme was <Col N="1186"/>introduced in June 2004. In addition to an average increase of 28% in payment rates, payment of &euro;200 per hectare is also provided for the first 20 hectares, &euro;175 per hectare for the next 20 hectares and further payment digression thereafter.</P>
        <P>Under the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, compensatory allowances payable in the disadvantaged areas moved from a payment per animal to a payment based on area. Under the area based scheme, farmers in the disadvantaged areas with a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per hectare can qualify for payment on up to 45 hectares of land. Approximately 99,800 farmers qualify for payments totalling &euro;231 million annually. This represents an average payment of &euro;2,315 compared with an average payment of &euro;1,523 under the old headage schemes. The smaller farmer has benefited under the new scheme, which will continue in its present format for 2005 and 2006.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission&rsquo;s proposal for the post-2006 rural development framework provides for the reclassification of disadvantaged areas. The suggested new methodology would be based on natural conditions, notably soil and climatic factors. The socioeconomic criteria taken into account to designate the current eligible areas will no longer apply. At meetings of the Council of Ministers, I have stressed that this is an extremely important and sensitive issue. Other member states have also adopted a similar position. I will continue to seek a solution that is equitable and in Ireland&rsquo;s interests. I cannot be definitive as to the shape of that solution, since negotiations are still in progress.</P>
        <P>With regard to the dairy sector, under the milk quota restructuring programme which I announced before Christmas, small farmers again receive consideration, in that producers with a quota of less than 350,000 litres will be able to purchase twice the amount available to larger producers in the same co-operative area. Moreover, younger farmers with less than 350,000 litres will have priority access to a further 25% of the pool.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</P>
        <P>Priority was given to applications from small scale producers under the milk quota appeals tribunal hardship scheme for 2004-05. Under the single payment scheme, there is provision for modulation whereby a reduction of up to 5% is made in each farmer&rsquo;s entitlement to fund certain rural development measures. However, this money will be refunded in respect of the first &euro;5,000 of each farmer&rsquo;s single payment. The result is that up to 45% of Irish farmers &mdash; essentially those in the smaller category &mdash; will not be affected by modulation. In so far as it is possible, therefore, support is provided under my Department&rsquo;s schemes, for smaller farmers. Support is also available to eligible farmers under the farm assist scheme, administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply. Given that farmers with less than 20 livestock units are not eligible for grant aid under the current structure, it will be difficult for them to survive. Does the Minister accept farmers in counties such as Cavan and Monaghan who went into pig and poultry production on small acreage are not eligible either while mushroom producers are in serious difficulty?</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, for their efforts to designate the remainder of County Monaghan as disadvantaged. It proves the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor ignored the issue and failed to deliver. I pay tribute to both of them.</P>

	<P>I refer to the Teagasc office in Bailieboro, which is to close. How can small farmers survive if advice is not available within 20 or 30 miles of their homes? This is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated. If small farmers are to remain in business, they must be given realistic grant aid and advice regarding alternatives to generate income outside farming. If that is not done, the industry will change dramatically in the next five years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>People in my county used to be envious of Deputy Crawford&rsquo;s county when it came to intensive farming. I agree there are serious issues in the pig and poultry sectors. We have met everyone involved, including local authority officials, public representatives and the farming organisations, and we are working together on a partnership basis to address these issues. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and myself are examining alternative methodologies to reduce costs in these sectors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all listening. Mushroom producers have been through a difficult time in recent years. While the number of producers has reduced, the output is still good. We are anxious to maintain and develop the industry. We have provided support and investment and Bord Bia has done a great deal of work to promote the industry.</P>
        <P>Deputy Naughten wants commercial farmers to be looked after while Deputy Crawford is looking out for small farmers. There are a few large farmers in his constituency. New methods must be developed to support different farmers. REPS has been helpful for small farming enterprises. With regard to alternatives, we have debated why farmers are not going into organic farming, despite the significant money being made available in this area, which is not being taken up. Free range farming also presents a significant opportunity. It is almost as easy, if not cheaper, <Col N="1188"/>than organic farming. Members should visit the farmers in County Louth who have taken up free range farming. They have done well and they achieve higher prices for their products. We must think outside the box.</P>
        <P>The Teagasc office issue is a kick for touch job. The issue has been raised and the three Ministers will meet Teagasc representatives in this regard. However, the issue must be examined in a pragmatic, sensible way. Will we approach this in a professional manner or will we leave the service as it has been for the past 40 or 50 years? Teagasc&rsquo;s advisory service is superb but a first class service, including an outreach facility, must be provided while working with farmers. Many Teagasc employees go out and about to talk to farmers and they are very much part of the community. A number of issues arise regarding the closure of offices, which are politically sensitive. We will examine them but the Teagasc board makes the decisions, not the Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ridiculous. Teagasc is short of money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Teagasc has plenty of money. A more modern approach to farming must be taken and this can be reflected in many ways. The smaller farmer could be as adept as the larger farmer at adopting the new approach. The Department&rsquo;s role in providing support will be examined. We will also examine the way in which the role of Teagasc will change because farming has changed. The three Ministers will discuss these issues with the Teagasc board in the next fortnight.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister has had ongoing meetings with the personnel from Teagasc, especially in her constituency regarding pigs and poultry. Some issues, such as the technicality of transferring slurry and manure of a definite value from one farm to another, need not be significant and could be solved, but it is now tied up in red tape. An elderly farmer who is not fully utilising his land could utilise this valuable asset but instead he is required to sow bags of imported fertiliser. Can an effort be made to remove some of that red tape? A farmer must have a C2 before he can accept manure from a pig farmer. If we were sensible we could get around many problems without major expense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Crawford is correct and this issue has been raised by the cross-Border group and pig farmers. Another practical issue is that there are many part-time farmers and it is easier for them to spread artificial manure on a Saturday as opposed to meeting another farmer to acquire organic manure. Teagasc and farmers state that organic manure is better than bags of bought fertiliser. We have examined this from a REPS point of view. People are afraid of it, which is silly as it is organic.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not clear at this stage what the planting outturn will be for 2005. Planting outturn is entirely dependent on demand. Most new planting is now carried out by farmers, and demand from farmers will dictate how many hectares are planted this year. Best estimates at this time are for a planting level of between 11,000 and 14,000 hectares.</P>
        <P>This year &euro;124 million, the largest allocation in the history of the State, is being provided to enable farmers to seriously consider forestry as a land use option that will provide a generous income for up to 20 years, with 100% of the planting costs being met by public funds. This, together with the opportunity of planting up to 50% of a farm holding while still retaining the full single payments entitlements, must make forestry an attractive proposition. In addition to the planting and premium payments, my Department also funds a wide range of support schemes, including provision for the construction of forest roads and woodland improvement. An active research and development programme pursued by COFORD is also funded by my Department. Forestry provides a real land use alternative that is both economically and environmentally sustainable over the long term and one which offers a real future to farmers, their families and their communities.</P>
        <P>Forestry has a key role to play in the environment. Forests are &ldquo;carbon sinks&rdquo; which trap and hold the carbon created by our modern economy. It provides us with clean air, recreational areas and new habitats for our wildlife. However, to maximise these benefits we must continue to plant. The combination of generous grants and premiums with the new stacking concessions means that there has never been a better time to plant.</P>
        <P>The proposals contained in the draft rural development regulation, under negotiation in Brussels at present, will have implications for our ambitious afforestation programme, which under Sustaining Progress targets an annual planting level of 20,000 hectares. Certain improvements in the proposals from a forestry point of view have been made and while recognising that forestry is only one element of a wide-ranging rural development proposal I will be pressing for an outcome on forestry which best suits the particular needs of this country.</P>

Are there plans to review the provisions for planning permission to ensure that planting takes place in a sensible and appropriate manner and that communities and individuals are not isolated by the type of planting that takes place?</P>

        <Quest>her views on the very small increase in farm incomes in 2004 as reported by the CSO which are not keeping pace with inflation; the proposals she has to improve farm incomes; the proportion of farm incomes which is derived directly from payments from her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[14189/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In February 2005 the Central Statistics Office reported a 3% increase in aggregate farm income for 2004. It calculated that the value of the cattle, sheep and pig sectors increased by approximately 8.3%, 6.1% and<?oasys _jy?>6.2%, respectively. From an income perspective, the livestock sector had a reasonably positive year, with the dairy sector experiencing steady milk output and prices.</P>
        <P>These improvements reflect continuing positive trading conditions on EU markets for beef with consumption within the European Union exceeding production, good national and international demand for sheep meat and strong pig prices, while steady demand for dairy commodities helped maintain milk prices. The consumer price index, which measures the annual rate of inflation in Ireland, increased by 2.2% during <Col N="1192"/>2004 so the increase in aggregate farm income was marginally higher than the rate of inflation.</P>
        <P>This increase in incomes should be viewed in a positive light when account is taken of the fact that a substantial amount of the payments on 2004 premia entitlements will be paid this year in conjunction with the single payment scheme. In the past few years an 80% advance was paid on many premia schemes. In 2004 only a 60% balance could be paid. Therefore, the 2005 figure will include a 40% balancing payment due on livestock premia compared with 20% in the previous years.</P>
        <P>To underpin the financial stability of the sector, my Department operates a range of measures, including market supports and direct payments aimed at supporting farm incomes. In 1990 direct payments accounted for 23% of aggregate farm income. Since the CAP reform of 1992, direct payments to farmers have risen and by the late 1990s they accounted for 50% of aggregate farm income. Direct payments paid by my Department to the farming sector in 2004 amounted to &euro;1.64 billion or 74% of aggregate farm income.</P>
        <P>I have vigorously pursued the goal of supporting farm incomes by maximising the level of direct payments to farmers, ensuring that the European Commission utilises all available management tools to support the markets, and by providing the best possible development framework for the sector. These very substantial direct payments reflect the real commitment of the Government to support farm incomes. These payments are in addition to other forms of market supports and grant aid for investment in farm structures.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the statistics on the current situation of the entire farm industry. A significant factor is the large drop in the number of full-time farmers. The number of part-time farmers has increased accordingly, although not quite in the same proportion. What plans are in place to ensure the viability of those part-time farmers? Off-farm income will become more significant than it is currently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Upton. As she is aware, the review carried out by former Deputy Alan Dukes indicates the number of farmers involved. That number is detailed in the reply to another parliamentary question, but I cannot locate it. There is a change in profile of farmers. Many of them are involved in part-time farming and it is difficult to get young people to enter farming on a full-time basis. There should be a balance between both.</P>
        <P>I do not agree that anything below a certain livestock unit is uneconomic. While it may be uneconomic in some terms it has an economic advantage in that it is part of the fabric of our rural society and that is the way it should be. We have tried to provide the opportunity, through the single farm payment, to those who wish to expand to do so and decide the way they want to <Col N="1193"/>go forward when it comes to the development of their enterprise as they are not now tied into retention periods, stocking densities or whatever. The change taking place in respect of practical issues such as marts being held in the evening to support part-time farmers, the provision of education at night and similar ideas reflect what is now happening in agriculture. We should try to achieve a fair balance but we must give particular supports to the people in farming for the long haul, who wish to have a viable income, and allow them to develop and flourish. Equally, there is nothing wrong with part-time farming. It allows investment as a consequence of an off-farm income being available to farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Minister another statistic to consider as she has doled out many of them in the past few minutes. Since her Government took office in 1997, 70 farmers a week have left agriculture. In the context of the single farm payment post-decoupling and the proposals on the nitrates directive, farmers with less than 20 livestock units will be in severe difficulty, as will the large commercial farmers. In respect of the smaller producer, however, traditionally many small producers in some parts of the country would have used ring feeders for wintering out cattle. That can no longer happen. Teagasc must focus on alternative methods, whether in respect of storage, wintering of cattle and alternative products such as organic products.</P>
        <P>In that respect, will the Minister ask Teagasc and the other Ministers, when she meets them, to reconsider the closure of the farm in Ballinamore, County Leitrim? It has a major benefit in terms of the type of marginal land, which could be used as a test farm to try out new enterprises that could provide alternatives for many of those part-time and small farmers in the western region, whether in respect of slurry storage, new wintering out procedures or alternative products, be they free range or organic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will toss back that low ball to the Deputy and also send him a curved one. The reason many people have left farming is that there are better opportunities available due to the good economic climate that has been supported and progressed by this side of the House.</P>

        <P>On the other available initiatives, Teagasc has provided me with the results of some work on earthen banks. It is now preparing guidelines for me. In the next fortnight it will complete some more work with regard to alternative ways of wintering out cattle. That will be made available to me in the next few weeks, at which time it will be made available to everyone.</P><Col N="1194"/>

	<P>In recent weeks the Taoiseach has given the House some indication of the way the Government proposes to deal with the appalling conditions that apply in many accident and emergency units throughout the country. The Government&rsquo;s response has been to hide behind the ten-point plan published last November, which the Taoiseach has admitted will not make any serious inroads until next autumn. We have also seen the spectacle of a number of Ministers flying kites such as the use of St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital and other issues.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>We learned today that Tallaght Hospital was forced to suspend elective surgery between 13 and 22 April because of serious overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit. Yesterday, there were 21 patients on trolleys in Tallaght, 22 in the Mater and 32 in Beaumont Hospital and Naas Hospital. Throughout the country yesterday there were 237 patients on trolleys. The latest proposal from Government and the Health Service Executive is to instruct all hospitals to add an extra bed to each ward to deal with this problem. It appears the Government is continuously trying to invent a policy on the hoof, so to speak.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>First, if this is such a good idea, why was it not included in the ten-point plan last November? Second, will the Taoiseach indicate the status of the report from the Health and Safety Executive in respect of an instruction to hospitals to move patients from trolleys into additional beds to be placed in existing wards? Third, was that proposal discussed and agreed at a Cabinet committee as reported last week? Fourth, has any risk assessment been done in respect of this proposed move from a health and safety and infection control perspective? What is going on? Is anybody in charge in respect of this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I can go back over all the initiatives again if necessary but I will confine myself to answering the questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Just on this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;raised by the Deputy. The ten-point plan the HSE has drawn up in conjunction with the Department is under way. The HSE <Col N="1196"/>has now put its own action team into the key accident and emergency departments to try to assist by talking to management and staff with a view to bringing this proposal to fruition as quickly as possible. Some of these matters can happen quickly, others cannot. There was a meeting of the health committee last week at which the HSE outlined to the members of Government on that committee the type of actions it is trying to implement. The proposals to put additional beds into wards or open up other beds are nothing new. In some hospitals additional beds are put into wards. That was the traditional way of dealing with accident and emergency crises. It tends not to be done now because of staff objections, which I can understand. Health and safety issues may arise also. Where beds can be made available, particularly those adjacent to accident and emergency departments, they are looking at trying to do that. In fact, they are examining all measures on the ground with the management of the hospital, the medical executives and the hospital executives of any area, that they believe can help the nursing staff. That is being done on a one to one basis in hospitals. The solution in one hospital may not be the appropriate solution in another. They are working with the staff to find solutions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny asked about the Health and Safety Authority, which has completed its programme of inspections. Everything the authority has recommended is being implemented as quickly as possible. While there are no further risks, there is enough to address in the current issues. All of the other measures I have outlined in recent weeks, especially the sourcing of suitable accommodation for people who do not need acute beds but who cannot go home, are being implemented as are the health care packages. While all of these initiatives are under way, it will take some time to complete the process. In Cork, Blanchardstown and other hospitals in which they have been provided, new facilities are operating fairly well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not ask the Taoiseach about the report of the Health and Safety Authority, but will do so now. According to the report, wards, exits from wards and fire escapes were blocked with trolleys and other equipment in a number of cases. The report also stated that, in the context of overcrowding, consultations should take place in every case in which extra bed capacity was to be allocated to a ward. Is that being done in every such instance?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on today&rsquo;s claim by the Irish Nurses Organisation that there are hundreds of empty beds nationally which could be utilised, of which approximately 150 are in Dublin alone, without adding to the pressure on existing wards? Is the Taoiseach happy that full use is being made of existing bed capacity, without adding to the risk of infection or compromising health and safety, by moving beds into existing wards?</P><Col N="1197"/>
      <P>I understand that approximately 25% of those who attend accident and emergency units at weekends are intoxicated or drunk out of their minds and oftentimes accompanied by hangers on. What is the Government response to such circumstances which arise every weekend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the Health and Safety Authority in response to Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s question as to whether the authority was involved with the HSE in ensuring the executive&rsquo;s initiatives were in line with its requirements. The process is underway. I am told the HSA has acknowledged that hospitals are fully engaged in a process of addressing health and safety requirements in accident and emergency units.</P>
      <P>We were told last week at a meeting attended by most of its executive team that the Health Service Executive was examining on a case-by-case basis hospitals with beds which were not open or which could be used to alleviate accident and emergency and other problems. The team went through a range of initiatives at different hospitals to tackle their different problems. The executive is working on the ground to find resolutions to the problems. Bed managers and other hospital staff have engaged last week and this week directly with those problems. Mr. Doran of the Irish Nurses Organisation has written to me in the last few days to provide records of beds the organisation believes could be opened. I passed the information to the T&aacute;naiste and the Department of Health and Children and it will be examined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny was correct to indicate that a significant cause of major difficulties at accident and emergency units is alcohol. It is estimated by the experts in the field that between 25% and 35% of patients presenting are under the influence, which proportion rises to 75% during the peak hours of Saturday night and Sunday morning. I am not in a position to correct the figure, but the experts say alcohol is the key issue at accident and emergency units at peak hours. If it is anywhere between 25% and 75%, they are right. Short-term patients present with injuries directly related to the fact that they are heavily under the influence of alcohol which creates a problem. I do not suggest it is the only issue facing accident and emergency services as there are obviously problems at other times.</P>
      <P>Alcohol abuse is a problem which cannot be addressed solely at accident and emergency level as it is a problem for society as a whole. Many initiatives have been put forward by many groups, including the task force on alcohol. I met the task force recently to discuss the 77 recommendations it has put forward, all of which are worthy of being acted on. It is no use to say the matter can be easily resolved, because it involves problems of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Without warning on 5 March, garda&iacute; took the five children of Padraig and Mary O&rsquo;Hara into care on foot of a court order <Col N="1198"/>obtained by the HSE in the Kells area. Of the children, four are autistic and their separation from their parents and a well established routine was traumatic. The parents were required to submit to psychiatric examination despite the possession by officials of a clinical psychology report testifying to their good parenting and character. Since four of their children were diagnosed with autism four years ago, the O&rsquo;Haras have been engaged in a struggle for basic services with the HSE, which threatened reprisals if the parents went public about their difficulties. More than seven weeks after the court ordered the immediate return of the children to their parents, no official at any level of the HSE has lifted a telephone to call the O&rsquo;Haras, whose children had supposedly been at risk.</P>
      <P>Why was this family treated brutally through an act of bureaucratic vindictiveness? This was a grossly excessive abuse of authority. The O&rsquo;Haras are not alone in the treatment they have received from persons acting in the name of the HSE. Does the Taoiseach agree that an investigation by a competent person into the HSE&rsquo;s handling of the case is necessary? Will the Taoiseach provide an assurance that no further threat will hang over the family in the absence of any allegation of wrongdoing on their part? I stress that the O&rsquo;Haras have been commended on their diligence and care of their children as the clinical psychology report testifies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte will appreciate, I have not followed the case in the last few weeks. I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s statement that no one has called on them and will request that the matter is examined. I recall the matter and have the note I used to inform the House earlier last month of what the family&rsquo;s needs were. I recall also why the issue arose and the children were taken from the family. I do not wish to get into saying anything unhelpful about the family or the staff involved. The staff had consulted at some length and had to take into account the threats that were made on the lives of the children, which were something they could not ignore. Qualified staff made their decision on the basis that it was a matter which could not be overlooked. I am not in a position to overlook the matter either. They acted and after the subsequent case the children were released. I am sure the staff acted on the basis of their professional knowledge. They were not inexperienced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has asked me to discover why, if these issues were so important then, nothing has happened since. From the State&rsquo;s point of view, there was a recognition of the unique needs of the family, which was under pressure. I recall the matter well and have every reason to understand the pressure the family faced in the circumstances. My Cabinet colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who is very familiar with the case and had been dealing with it, outlined the circumstances to me at the time. I do not wish to go <Col N="1199"/>through them all but the State provided many different services to the family in various ways and also gave a statutory payment to the family. As I understand it, the Deputy&rsquo;s question is whether I will ask that this matter be examined by a competent person and I will certainly take that up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not expect the Taoiseach to recall the detail of this case. I wrote to the T&aacute;naiste about it on 24 March asking her to investigate the policies, procedures and practices of the Health Service Executive in this area. I appreciate that the T&aacute;naiste has other pressures on her. I know that, like me, she met the O&rsquo;Hara family recently. However, the Taoiseach has missed the point if he believes that the actions of the HSE personnel were caused by threats made to them or that the children were at risk. There is no evidence to bear that out and the judge made that clear. Furthermore, this is not the only family that has been treated in this fashion. The Taoiseach has missed the basis of the point I raised, which was that it was a gross abuse of authority and an act of vindictiveness by personnel employed by the Health Services Executive in that particular area. When they were negotiating for a care package, it was not forthcoming. How is it that if the family concerned was deemed to be at sufficient risk to be taken into care, in the seven weeks that have transpired since the court caused them to be returned to their parents, nobody in the HSE has even made a telephone call to know how they are? The Taoiseach is seriously misinformed if he believes that there is justification, despite the judgment of the court in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte knows, the point I made concerned why the team acted as it did in the first place, not after the court case. According to my note, the provision of the multidisciplinary team service together with all the other service elements is dependent on the service of a case manager to co-ordinate and complete service delivery. An experienced case manager was employed in early 2005 to undertake this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Mr. English</NameTxt>
	<P>Have they moved since?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>However, as a result of verbal abuse received by telephone from Ms O&rsquo;Hara, the case manager resigned. Following his resignation, Ms O&rsquo;Hara visited his house and was asked to leave by the case manager&rsquo;s spouse. However, Ms O&rsquo;Hara returned and this violation of privacy has had a further distressing impact on the staff member whose family and home have now been inappropriately involved in the service issue.</P>
      <P>The Meath disability service awaits proposals from Enable Ireland in respect of the case management function together with the multi<Col N="1200"/>disciplinary team interventions, but recent communications from the family indicate they do not consider Enable Ireland to be appropriate providers of the case management function.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the court adjudicated on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

	<P>They formed a judgment and it went to court, although fortunately not every case ends up in court. They had put in place a range of services for family needs. The case was in court. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the T&aacute;naiste has met the family and I know that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has also met them. Deputy Rabbitte asked me whether a competent person would examine the case and he also asked why nobody had called to the family since. I cannot answer the latter question but I have the list of all the needs that have been put in place, although I do not think it is necessary to put the personal details of a case on the record. I will inquire as to why nobody has called but these needs were put in place and they went through a fairly detailed report.</P>

	<P>When the Minister for Agriculture and Food answered questions earlier, she told us that one fifth of all farm land is now leased. As we know, one of the reasons is that the cost of purchasing farm land is so exorbitant. Does the Taoiseach and his Government accept some of the responsibility in this regard? One area in rural County Dublin has a price tag of &euro;200,000 per acre based on the plans for the relocation of Mountjoy Prison. Does the Taoiseach accept that the price of &euro;30 million for 150 acres is considerably more than the going rate of &euro;17,000 per acre? Even with a compulsory purchase order, the National Roads Authority would pay a maximum of &euro;24,000 per acre after capital gains tax. Does the Taoiseach accept that a serious problem is being created by taking the eye off the ball when it comes to agricultural land acquisition for which the Government is responsible?</P>
      <P>Is that fiasco not being compounded by the second annual report of the inspector of prisons, which was published recently? That indicated that relocation was not the only option, even through the inspector, Mr. Kinlan, wrote that he had witnessed very low standards in the running of prisons. Whom does the Taoiseach hold responsible for this? Does he regard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as being responsible for driving this relocation project, for placing no limit on the money that could be spent on it and for not seeking an environmental impact assessment on such a large site, which would be normal practice? Does the Taoiseach also regard the Minister as being responsible for not investigating the breach of normal procurement procedures when a member of the extended family, who was the special adviser, was found to be related to the vendor of the site? Would he regard the Minister as being responsible for stigmatising people with mental illness who, in the Central Mental Hospital, will find themselves living beside Mountjoy Prison if it is relocated? The Taoiseach should investigate this matter and put it on hold. Will he do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked me about two issues. His first question concerned the statement by the Minister for Agriculture and Food that 1% of agricultural land is being made available for the market. That is a matter for the market. I cannot force people who own agricultural land to sell it. If they wish to use it for agricultural purposes, that is a matter for them. If I were to bring proposals to the House for the compulsory acquisition of agricultural land, we would see what the difficulty would be, apart from the fact that it would be unconstitutional.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte would not support me on that measure if I, or anybody else, brought it to the House.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, it has long been pointed out that we need prison accommodation to replace Mountjoy. It has been highlighted by many reports over many decades, not to mention Judge Kinlan&rsquo;s recent report. A long process was entered into, which included the examination of suitable sites, to try to find one large enough to replace Mountjoy with a modern facility appropriate for the inmates and close enough to Dublin from where a large proportion of prisoners come. It had to be capable of being built in such a way as to seclude it from other lands by properly protecting it. That is what the Government decided and it is what the Minister is following through on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It amazes me to hear the Taoiseach decrying compulsory purchase orders when the National Roads Authority uses such orders with impunity. I do not regard them as a significant problem, except perhaps in the sense that people may complain they are not getting enough for their land. Why would they complain, however, when sums of &euro;200,000 per acre are offered? Why is the Taoiseach standing over such a gross overspend of public money?</P>
      <P>The Mountjoy site has a new women&rsquo;s prison, &euro;10 million has been spent on a training centre in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and capital expenditure of &euro;6 million has been spent on Spike Island which is to be closed down. Questions have arisen regarding a conflict of interest in the deal for the prison site which I understand could have been settled for much less. Will the Taoiseach ensure the Comptroller and Auditor General is made aware of this? It is a matter of public interest that he be informed and investigate what appears to be a strange purchase.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach insist that an environmental impact assessment is carried out given that the relevant directive appears to indicate that one is required for an area of this size? They are definitely necessary if a planning application is required. Does the Taoiseach realise he will be in trouble again with the European Court of Justice unless he insists such an assessment is carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps some land costs &euro;200,000 per acre and other land is worth far more. We have seen sites in this and other cities&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach referring to Abbotstown?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1203"/>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In general, land prices have gone up from under &euro;5,000 per acre ten years ago to about &euro;14,000 per acre now. That is the going rate rather than the prices which have been mentioned. Sometimes trying to relocate a prison is difficult while at other times relocation is welcomed. I was Minister for Finance some years ago when a prison was opened in Roscommon. People were very glad to see the prison there, with employment and other knock-on effects of the move.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent will agree that Mountjoy Prison, with the exception of the women&rsquo;s prison which is a new building, has long outlived its use. It has been condemned in report after report as not being suitable to deal with the population it has and not having the kind of facilities which are required.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>When Mr. Mervyn Taylor, a former Labour Party Deputy, was Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the rainbow Government more than ten years ago, he directed that at least 40% of seats on State boards be allocated to women. We are some distance from achieving this figure on many State boards. For instance, the board of the National Economic and Social Council, which falls under the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department, has six women compared with 26 men. How does the Taoiseach expect his Ministers to be guided by a 40% recommendation when there is such a clear failure to achieve the target in an organisation connected to his Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the overall figure for women on boards is approximately 40%. The figure for the NESF is 44% and the figure mentioned by the Deputy probably refers to the NESC. The big problem regarding the boards for which I have responsibility, those which come under social partnership and outside organisations, is getting the nominating groups to appoint women. This is an ongoing battle. We have been trying across a number of areas to get the nominating bodies to give us three names or panels of names from which we can choose. As regards the boards over which we have control, we certainly endeavour to make sure we meet the target. Having been involved in this for some time, it is a struggle and a half to get the social partnerships to achieve anywhere near the 40% figure.</P>

        <P>As I outlined to the House on 1 March last, in so far as the report makes recommendations for improvements in the procurement procedures, additional procedures have been approved by the Government for incorporation into the Cabinet handbook and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website. Those procedures will give the Secretary General to the Government and the Government secretariat a role in examining certain procurements. These procedures were brought to the attention of all Secretaries General who were asked to implement them and bring them in future to the attention of all newly appointed Ministers or, where relevant, Ministers of State in their Departments or offices. They were effective immediately upon announcement on 17 February. In doing this, I have implemented all the recommendations by Mr. Quigley which were relevant to my Department.</P>
        <P>There is no special unit in my Department for the application of the procedures and there was at no time an intention to establish such a unit. Any workload arising from the application of these guidelines is being handled within existing resources in the Government secretariat.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I read recently about the extraordinary amounts being paid to some personnel dealing with Departments. May I assume that circumstances in which a person such as Mr. Quigley will be called in to investigate the antics of an individual Minister or Minister of State who decides to take business into his or her own hands, as it were, will not arise again and that the Taoiseach has instructed all Ministers and Ministers of State to this effect? I am not sure whether the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comment regarding new Ministers and Ministers of State indicates he plans to have more of them. In the event that he has such plans, I am sure the new appointees will have to comply with the same regulations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>They apply to existing and new Ministers &mdash; and will forever, I hope. I have implemented the recommendations Mr. Quigley made regarding my Department. He also made recommendations about other Departments which I hope have also been implemented. They have certainly been given to the other Departments to implement.</P>
        <P>The guidelines apply in particular, as Mr. Quigley asked and recommended, in the area of public relations and communications, where there is a significant element of direct service to a Minister or where a Minister suggests the name of a person or enterprise for a consultancy or contract. It was in these circumstances, in particular, that <Col N="1207"/>Mr. Quigley highlighted the need for a different procedure. In these circumstances the Secretary General of the relevant Department is required to inform the Secretary General to the Government who will arrange, if necessary, for the Government secretariat to inquire about any aspects of the proposed procurement that it considers necessary. Arising from this, the Secretary General will then make recommendations to me as to whether any special conditions should be observed in the procurement process. This means an issue can no longer be processed without first being highlighted and examined. If necessary, recommendations will be made. This process by itself should, I hope, diminish the numbers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To take an example, if a Minister travelling with a number of officials to the United States, Europe or elsewhere decides he or she needs a consultant or consultants to travel with him or her to provide specialist advice, does the procedure require that the consultant or consultants in question will pay their way and charge the Department subsequently, as distinct from the Department paying their way in the first instance? Is the procedure in this regard clear?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If somebody is working in or associated with a Ministry, normally the group travelling is cleared beforehand. In the case of a European Council meeting, the full delegations from all Departments are put to me for approval before they go. If a Department was making a case for an outside expert to come, a rare occurrence, my consideration is that it is not a good idea. It is better that the person should go directly in those circumstances and send his or her bill the normal way. It is the only way to get a clear line of distinction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Taoiseach knows from two recent examples, the papers on file are examined when the likes of Mr. Quigley or Mr. Travers are sent in. Knowing the quality, diligence and experience of our civil servants, the files are usually kept in order. The substance of the matter being inquired into, if it cannot be supported by paper work, is deemed not to have happened. The Taoiseach and I, as men of the world, know that is not what happened in either of the two cases here. Has the Taoiseach issued or caused to be issued from his office a circular to his Ministers and Ministers of State arising from the Quigley report drawing their attention expressly to the matters with which they must comply from now on?</P>
        <P>Are there consultancy contracts of whatever character being awarded below a certain threshold in any Department that are not going through the procedure of requiring a tender or raising it to the level envisaged as a result of the Quigley report?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1208"/>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Rabbitte asking if there is a procedure if the tender is under a certain amount?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is a small contract.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regardless, if it is directly associated with a Minister, it still should be checked. That is my understanding, subject to correction. I do not think there is a monetary amount on it.</P>
        <P>It is up to individual Departments and Ministers to satisfy themselves whether particular tenders or contracts need to be referred to the Secretary General. It is, however, now a requirement of the Cabinet handbook and I have made that known.</P>
        <P>In any of these investigations, and we have seen a number of them in recent times, it was not just the record that was examined, individuals were interviewed at length, certainly in the case of the report by Mr. Quigley. He did not just follow a paper trail.</P>
        <P>Deputy Rabbitte made an interesting point that I have made and I hope it does not become an issue in future. He correctly said that normally the files and records are in good order. This is an exposed area for politicians. Regularly, I walk around my Department and people ask me for a decision, direction or view and I give it. Politicians do not have the benefit of writing detailed memos and often, as good as a person thinks his or her memory is, one has no recollection of it when it is raised. That worries me in this day and age, where everybody else will be writing detailed memoranda but politicians must do their best to keep things moving. There lies a question for politicians to focus on because it will arise again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the political activity that was the subject of the inquiry absolutely forbidden for outside consultants now? Is it a necessary condition of employment that is the case? Apart from a circular, are the procedures arising from the report now in the Cabinet handbook? Are they to be inserted and when will that happen?</P>
        <P>Following a previous question on this matter, has the Taoiseach had the chance to review if his Department is the most appropriate place for adjudication of the procurement process? He may answer that the Cabinet secretariat undertakes this function but is that not part of his Department as well? Does the Taoiseach think there should be outside adjudication of such matters so their integrity is beyond doubt?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been implemented in the Cabinet guidelines. The book has not been reprinted but it is on the website.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked if an adviser can be of a political nature. The report does not mean an advisor cannot be of a political nature. Quigley highlighted that if someone is being appointed on that basis, the appointment must go through the procedures. That is what is set down, not that a <Col N="1209"/>person with a political affiliation or association is banned. That was not the spirit of the report. If such a person is going into a contract like this, there is a procedure that should be followed.</P>
        <P>The Cabinet secretariat prepares and is responsible for the work on Cabinet guidelines and other procedures and rules so it is the obvious place to do this. The civil servants in that section are familiar with this work. They probably would prefer not to be engaged in this kind of checking but there is not another suitable place unless an outside contractor is employed to check the work of an outside contractor. That would not be a good idea either. In the absence of a more suitable place for arbitration, the Cabinet secretariat is a good location.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach accept that lessons have been learned from the Quigley report? What were those lessons? Will there now be fewer contracts between Departments and public relations companies? Is the Taoiseach comfortable with the amounts spent on these lavish PR exercises? One company was paid more than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise out of these questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making the point that some companies have been paid a fortune for this. Is the Taoiseach comfortable with that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking about the report itself and it is reasonable to ask about the amounts of money spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The next question deals with the communications unit and the Deputy should ask his questions then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach learned any lessons from the report, particularly in regard to many of the companies and the amount of money spent? I am sure he is aware of many projects in his own area where that money could be well spent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The relevance of the issues raised has served a useful purpose. Government guidelines and procedures have been changed to deal with these issues and to ensure they do not happen again. If public relations or communications issues arise, they go through a different procedure, particularly if they are associated or there is a direct service element to the Minister or Minister of State.</P>
        <P>In complying with the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s ruling, any consultancy or public relations exercises involved with the Department of the Taoiseach, which are minimal enough, are based around the presentation of data to the public. It <Col N="1210"/>is not public relations in the sense referred to by the Deputy. The work mainly involves compiling reports or researching and gathering data. I do not have large public relations launches or strategies in my Department.</P>

        <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
        <Quest>the cost of his Department&rsquo;s communications unit for the first quarter of 2005; the way in which this compares to the first quarter of 2004; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[11885/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
        <P>The cost of the communications unit for the first quarter of 2005 was &euro;78,783. Of this, &euro;32,017 was a direct cost to my Department, with on average &euro;9,353 being borne by the five other Departments that have staff seconded to the unit. The cost of the communications unit for the first quarter of 2004 was &euro;75,069. Of this, &euro;29,560 was a direct cost to my Department, with on average &euro;9,102 being borne by the five other Departments that have staff seconded to the unit.</P>
        <P>The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news bulletins and transcripts, ensuring Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</P>
        <P>The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The unit&rsquo;s work means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies, ensuring they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. The communications unit is estimated to save Departments in excess of &euro;200,000 per annum.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We have dealt with this issue previously. I still have not taken up the Taoiseach&rsquo;s offer to see what this communications unit does. The cost of the unit for 2005 will be approximately &euro;320,000. The Taoiseach previously estimated that the communications unit saved the Government approximately &euro;200,000 in fees to external companies that would normally supply transcripts and tapes. Does the Taoiseach believe the unit gives value for money?</P>
        <P>If there is nothing surreptitious or underhand about the material upon which the unit casts its eye or which it hears, should it not be circulated to all Deputies? If there is a discussion on, for example, Shannonside Radio about the military barracks in Athlone, will the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, be given information on <Col N="1211"/>this or must it come from the local Fianna F&aacute;il cumann?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is more than likely that the Minister for Defence will have given the story to Shannonside Radio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>He could come down the River Shannon anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>That may well be the case. Does the unit collect information from all media outlets in the country or is it confined to the greater Dublin area?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is confined to the greater Dublin area. It does not monitor media outlets outside Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Internet?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, has no back-up?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The costs highlight the good value the unit provides in so far it not only gives information to Ministers, but a host of people within the Civil Service. The information is up-to-date and factual news material. It gives Departments transcripts and other materials which they require, mainly from national radio, which cuts down on large costs charged by several companies in this business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it will not provide that information to Members.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach has had time to reflect on the unit&rsquo;s merits and value. Does the Taoiseach see anything wrong in the information being made more widely available? Given that civil servants are engaged in collecting the information on the back of taxpayers&rsquo; money, is it not in the common good for Members to be brought into the information loop? We would be better informed to do our job in the House.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>The Taoiseach stated the limit of the unit&rsquo;s service was the greater Dublin area. How does this tie in with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s claim that the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, had no problem receiving information on what people were saying about electronic voting when he was in the Far East? Would Ms Monica Leech have got the information in the Far East, as well as the Minister? Is the information dispersed to wherever Ministers happen to be? If so, why can it not be dispersed to Deputies given that we are probably in Ireland when the Ministers are abroad?</P>
      </Speaker><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The unit covers local Dublin radio stations and the national media. The information is given to Ministers, their advisers and senior civil servants when they are abroad. The <Col N="1212"/>information can be dispersed through ISDN systems and text messaging. It is not available to every Member because they have that information if they listen to the morning news. The unit simply puts it into a handy form for Ministers and others.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a costly radio service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not. Before the unit was established, all Departments and agencies sought transcripts and tapes on an individual basis. However, this was costly. On a cheaper basis, six civil servants cover an 18-hour day, monitoring and giving useful and up-to-date headlines to Ministers, Ministers of State, their staff and a range of other civil servants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be a relief to the communications unit that it does not cover the extra-Dublin activities of the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea. He usually gives the story to the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and then reacts by denouncing it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>A double whammy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Taoiseach agree that Deputy Sargent&rsquo;s point is reasonable? If the communications unit is staffed by civil servants and paid for by public money and if the contents are as neutral as the Taoiseach claims, why should it not be made available to Members? The Taoiseach claims we would all hear it if we were listening to the radio. How are we supposed to listen to all radio broadcasts? Is Deputy Sargent not making an innovative and reasonable recommendation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The data prepared by civil servants in the normal course of work are not made available to everyone. They are only made available under freedom of information requests. Such requests have been made to the unit to get lists of the day&rsquo;s events. The normal work done by civil servants is not given to Deputies. This case is no different.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the sequence of events in the event of the communications unit detecting an alarming matter in the media, for example, a puncture in one of Deputy O&rsquo;Dea&rsquo;s tanks? What action is taken?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a hypothetical question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is highly hypothetical. Are consultants in various Departments automatically given the information gleaned from the media by the unit? If so, what action follows?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Durkan knows, civil servants do not get alarmed, they simply pass on the information. Ministers get alarmed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 14, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I received correspondence last year and again recently from the committee for the commemoration of the Irish Famine victims. An interdepartmental committee to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine and the bicentenary of the 1798 rebellion was established by the Government in 1994. Significant public funding was made available for a number of worthwhile projects of major importance and permanent significance including the national memorial at Croagh Patrick and the restoration of Famine graveyards. The committee disbanded after successfully fulfilling its task.</P>
        <P>These commemorations were the first of their kind since those tragic times and I have no doubt they will be commemorated again at appropriate future anniversaries. I do not however propose to designate an annual national day to commemorate the Famine. My Department has not received any application for funding for any Famine commemoration project this year. The last application received for such a project was in 2000 for a Famine memorial in Scotland and funding of &euro;6,000 was provided. Funding of &euro;25,000 was provided <Col N="1214"/>in 1999 for a Famine memorial in Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney.</P>
        <P>An amount of &euro;65,000 was allocated under subhead E of my Department&rsquo;s Estimates this year to support commemorative projects. This funding is available to assist individuals or groups in organising the commemoration of individuals or events of historic importance. My Department has not yet received any applications for the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Flight of the Earls in 2007. I am aware that community groups are now beginning to make plans for the commemoration of this important historical event and I expect that my Department will receive applications for funding in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Taoiseach said he is not in favour of a day of commemoration of the Famine. Will he re-think that? The Famine is the most cataclysmic event in our history in its impact on this island and its effect on so many countries outside Ireland. Up to 1 million of our people poured out of this country at the time in an effort to stay alive. Would it be appropriate for the Famine to be commemorated in the manner suggested by the committee that wrote to the Taoiseach?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach said he did not support a commemoration day but the correspondence I have from the Fianna F&aacute;il general secretary tells the committee: &ldquo;On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il I support your call for a day of commemoration to mark the tragic loss resulting from the Famine.&rdquo; He says that this followed discussions with the Taoiseach. In the light of that, will the Taoiseach reconsider and agree it would be appropriate to commemorate it, given the significance of the Famine and the resulting emigrant flow from that terrible event?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no great feeling one way or another on the issue. If people feel we should commemorate the Famine, we can do so. I have read the files on the matter and the debates which went on in this House for years between the political parties, and with Departments and agencies, about a national day of commemoration. Some 20 years ago there was a sense of a political decision being reached whereby all the different days commemorated, and those which people were requesting be commemorated, would all be subsumed into the national day of commemoration. That was to be broadly inclusive, and would serve also to remember Irish men and women who died in wars and in service with the UN, as well as being one proper, symbolic day of national commemoration. That decision was made for a good reason. Many well-meaning committees were seeking many different days of commemoration. I have experienced that, with people calling for special days. That carries on almost endlessly.</P>
        <P>Clearly the Famine greatly affected this country. In recent years I have tried to hold the line, and bring the various groups together to agree on <Col N="1215"/>one day. I have spent time with many religious groups and others, urging them quite successfully to become part of the national day of commemoration. Currently we are trying to attract members of certain faiths to join in this year&rsquo;s day of commemoration. I am not trying to detract from the merits of different commemorations but trying to involve all in one day. I would be open to including a Famine commemoration in that day but it is a good idea to try to have all the commemorations on one day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I see some merit in what the Taoiseach says but I regard the Famine as being quite an exception to the events noted regularly by many of my colleagues in their questions. I mean no disrespect to them in that regard. It is one thing to seek, as Deputy McGinley does, to commemorate the Flight of the Earls, but such an event is not comparable to the Famine. I suggest this was in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s mind when he discussed the matter with his general secretary, who says: &ldquo;I have discussed the matter with An Taoiseach&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is not responsible for a political party in this House. Neither is it appropriate to quote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle is correct on both issues. If he had allowed me to quote, the letter would be seen to be very interesting. I am asking the Taoiseach what caused him to change his mind since his discussion with the general secretary of Fianna F&aacute;il. The committee for the commemoration of the Famine victims is very earnest. It has furnished the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department and the various political parties with a cogent argument why this country, given its distance from the Famine, and relative economic affluence, should now be prepared to commemorate that event in our history, and why it should not be confused with other events which, as the Taoiseach says, might be commemorated in a single national day of commemoration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, I have no strong feelings on this matter. There may be a cross-party feeling in the House that we should have a day to commemorate the Famine. A good case for individual days has been made by various groups. The committee seeking to commemorate 1798 made a good case. Such committees are formed for a period and then move on. The 1641 commemoration committee was another. There have been many such committees. It is good that people care about history and put forward their case. There has been a suggestion to commemorate the role of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, Robert Emmet and others. I have been trying to focus on a single day of commemoration so that we do not return to proliferation. That happened prior to the decision on the national day of commemoration 20 years ago.</P><Col N="1216"/>
        <P>Historically, since the foundation of the State, we commemorate events every 25 years, 50 years, 75 years, on centenaries and bicentenaries. That has been the rule of thumb. A small committee worked on the issue in the mid-1980s, and bringing many different groups and days together was a matter of contention. Many groups and suggested dates were involved. Some groups were religious, some not. It was a matter of trying to bring everything together. Having researched the committee&rsquo;s work, it is clear it was not easy.</P>
        <P>I am not detracting from the importance of the Famine, but one can take it that as soon as a day is selected to commemorate any event, some ten or 15 groups will quickly make excellent arguments, backed by eminent historians, for commemorating other events. I have no objection to any commemoration but we should confine them to a single day. If someone has a very strong view on the subject, I will consider it. It is not a question of me changing my mind. People who have dealt with this for many years have pointed out the ongoing arguments and the battles that keep arising.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Rabbitte. The National Famine Memorial is at the base of Croagh Patrick and for a number of years there was a Famine commemoration walk from Delphi to Louisburgh to commemorate a tragedy there. Perhaps the matter should be considered again on an all-party basis. It might even be possible to do it in conjunction with world food aid day or the like. It is a central feature in the history of our country and its consequences have formed its people today. I met members of the committee mentioned by the Deputy and they are genuine in their appeal. If the Taoiseach does not have fixed views either way, he might take the lead on this issue and organise a group representing all parties and none in the House to consider this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I hear what the Deputies are saying. However, looking back over the years and at the 1986 period, and I have made this point to these committees previously, there is nothing worse than organising commemorations when nobody turns up for them. It is almost disrespectful. That happened in the past, when only small numbers turned up. That is the reason I have fought to keep these events together on a single appropriate day. I am not saying that would happen with the Famine day. I will not go into detail but I recall one important day when only eight people turned up for the church service.</P>
        <P>The easiest course is to give in on these issues but there must be sense. I am prepared to examine the matter but I believe combining these events, where people can come together and celebrate, is a more appropriate way of doing it than with bright ideas that become, within a short period, not well respected. That is my concern.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1217"/>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Taoiseach could clarify the situation. It was understood from the correspondence he was agreeable to a Famine memorial day and I have been informed that it is likely to be on 29 May. Is there a need to write directly to this group if it is embarking on organising a memorial day, supposedly with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s goodwill? Should there not be some clarity and discussion of what the Taoiseach meant when he made known his views on the matter previously? Does he accept that it is inappropriate to put such a huge traumatic event in Irish history, when more than 1 million people died and another 1 million left the country, on the same level as other tragedies of much smaller scale in terms of the human impact? Should we not recognise this as an event of enormous significance worldwide both for people of Irish descent and for people who are suffering through famines at present and as a reminder that there are lessons to be learned? I hope we have learned those lessons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Taoiseach with interest. Wicklow will celebrate its 400th anniversary next year. It is the youngest county in the country. Will he give an assurance that he will look favourably upon applications for funding from the baby county in the country to commemorate that important anniversary?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I like the garden county a great deal and I visited a beautiful part of it with the Deputy recently. The easiest thing I could do is agree to the national day suggested. However, 1798 is an enormous event for Wexford. What if somebody sought a designated day for that? Thousands of people died in Wexford. There are other parts of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Dublin and Kerry in 1974.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. In Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s constituency, people could talk about the passion associated with the Land League. It is not that any single event is not significant, and the Famine is significant in numerical terms, but there should be a way of combining them. That was done in 1986. We can embrace all these events. With no disrespect to the committee in this case, committees come and go. Twenty years ago, much thought was put into organising a national day of commemoration, respect and celebration. That should be considered. Otherwise, there could be a host of days of commemoration. It might be an important day but people will say, as Deputy Timmins just did, that some other day is more important for their region. Then one gets into an endless argument.</P>
        <P>This group is a good group but so are all the other groups. It is good that there is a historical connection and if people wish to examine it, we <Col N="1218"/>can do so. However, we should combine these commemorations into a single event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>During Question Time on 14 April 2005, Deputy McGinley questioned me on the findings of an independent investigation into alleged incidents of bullying, harassment and related matters in Waterways Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the course of supplementary questions, a number of exchanges took place as follows. Deputy McGinley asked: &ldquo;Did the report say <Col N="1223"/>there was bullying?&rdquo;, to which I replied, &ldquo;No, it did not.&rdquo; Deputy McGinley then asked further and said: &ldquo;The Minister saw the report but I did not.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In reply, I said:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am telling the Deputy what it is in the report. It said the allegations of harassment were not upheld.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Finally, Deputy McGinley stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">My understanding is that it specifically said there were incidents of bullying. The only way it will solve this is to get our hands on the report.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I replied:</P>
      <P LI="1">The investigation grouped the allegations into four main strands. Those strands are the findings of the investigation, as set out. The allegations of harassment, which is another word for bullying, were not upheld.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I would like to correct and clarify on the record my statement on 14 April on these matters. The correct version is as follows: &ldquo;allegations of harassment were not upheld by the investigation&rdquo;. However, there is a legal difference between harassment and bullying, which I overlooked in giving my reply. I should have answered in reply to the allegations regarding bullying as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">While the investigators concluded that there was substance to some of the allegations of bullying, the events themselves were found not to be as extensive or as serious as alleged. Furthermore, the investigators believed the difficulties created could have been minimised if the issues had been taken up by the complainant with the CEO at an earlier stage.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I apologise to the House for the incorrect information given but clarify that the error was totally inadvertent. The correct version of the position regarding these matters was already available to Deputy McGinley as he and other Opposition spokespersons had been provided with a copy of the summary of the findings of joint investigation, which included this information, by my office ten days earlier, on 4 April 2005. I am providing a copy of the relevant material to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, immediately following Question Time on 14 April, I spoke in detail with the Deputy in question regarding the issues involved which, as personnel issues, are sensitive and subject to the normal confidentiality that applies to such matters. I also offered that he be given a full confidential briefing on all aspects of the case by the senior official in my Department dealing with the matter, an offer that was taken up by him on 26 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment proposes to delete the provision that the CEO of the HSA shall not question or have an opinion on the merits of any Government policy when appearing before an Oireachtas committee. It is not proposed to accept this amendment. As Members are aware, the Minister has overall political responsibility for the operation of the authority. Clearly, the amendment, if accepted, could place the CEO in an invidious position. It only refers to policy matters. It is quite in order for the CEO, or indeed the board, to comment on the issue of resources or other matters. It is quite a narrow provision in section 49(2) relating to policy and objectives of such policy, not to resources and related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is just a standard gagging provision that Ministers put into legislation. It is healthy that a robust parliamentary scrutiny scheme has been developed through the committees of the Oireachtas, where a CEO can answer truthfully on policy issues. The robustness of a particular view may be tested in this way. The Minister of State should accept the amendment, remove the gag and allow freedom of expression to be given, not only to the CEO of this particular authority, but to every board as regards policy matters. It is important in any statutory body but even more important in one where policy governs health and welfare and where lives and the well-being of citizens are at stake. I do not see why there should be an embargo on the chief executive officer expressing a view on policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin is quite right in saying that this provision is in most legislation of this type, and is there for a good reason. I certainly intend to maintain it in this legislation because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State could be a pathfinder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it only refers to policy matters and not to issues such as resources. A reasonable point was made by a number of Deputies on the last occasion, and that is something the CEO or the board could raise before an Oireachtas com<Col N="1225"/>mittee or in any circumstances. In any event, there are at least three sections of the Bill which require the authority to give the Minister a briefing relating to the performance of his functions, prepare the three-year plan and so on. There are a number of provisions, therefore, where this legislation requires the CEO and the board to make particular information available.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 56, after line 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) Regulations for the purposes of <i>section 13(1)(c)</i> shall not be made unless a draft thereof has been approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 58, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(10) Regulations under this section may not create an indictable offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There was some discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. Amendment No. 37 simply states that regulations under this section may not create an indictable offence. Amendment No. 56 is related. The purpose of the amendment, as I explained on Committee Stages, is to reflect the provision of the European Communities Act 1972, which was recently emphasised by the Supreme Court in the case of Browne <i>v.</i> the Minister for the Marine. This is to the effect that regulations implementing an EU directive should not create an indictable offence.</P>
      <P>The upshot of section 78(3) as worded seems to be that the Minister cannot create an indictable offence by regulations for the purposes of the European Communities Act, but he is reserving the right to do so under this legislation, to give effect to EU law. That undermines the 1972 Act in a sideways action. The policy of the 1972 Act is that regulations to give effect to EU law should not create an indictable offence. That should be done by primary statute law brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that it is not a secondary legislation issue for a Minister to decide whether to create a new indictable offence under <Col N="1226"/>Irish law. My legal advice is that the import of the Minister of State&rsquo;s unwillingness to accept this amendment is to undermine that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Howlin raised this issue on Committee Stage and mentioned the case of Browne <i>v.</i> the Minister for the Marine, which arose in relation to the 1972 Act. My understand is that the finding of the court in that regard was that there was no provision for an indictable offence under the 1972 Act. In the provision, as proposed in the Bill, such indictable offences will be created in accordance with the EU directive. In circumstances where the primary legislation provides for indictable offences, it differs from the 1972 Act, which did not make provision for such offences. I am advised that in these circumstances it is appropriate, and indeed lawful, to provide for indictable offences by regulation.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the duties set out in the Bill are framework in nature and many of the more specific rules are set in regulations. These more specific rules apply to the construction industry, for instance, as regards proper scaffolding, and deaths on building sites may be traced back to failure in this regard. Other issues covered under regulations which could result in death or serious injury include unsafe conditions in the workplace, unsafe machinery and so on. They can only be provided for under regulation. I am advised that where there is provision for indictable offences, difficulties such as those which arose in the Browne <i>v.</i> the Minister for the Marine case relating to the 1972 Act would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is making my case. He is undermining the principle enunciated in the 1972 Act, which is not to create indictable offences by way of regulation or secondary legislation. I have no argument with the creation of such offences, but it should be done in statue law by bringing a Bill before the Houses in the normal way. It should not be open to the Minister to create indictable offences through secondary legislation. The Minister of State is agreeing with my analysis that he is now undermining the <i>de facto</i> position that it is not policy to create indictable offences in this fashion. This is a serious matter. If the Minister of State needs further legal briefing on it he can reserve his position now and I will not press it. It can be for consideration in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Arising from the point the Deputy made on Committee Stage, we went back for further legal advice. This advice was that where the Bill implements EU law and provides for indictable offences, it is appropriate to provide for them by regulation subsequently. Previously, it would have been done under the provisions of the 1972 Act. That was found to be deficient in the case of Browne <i>v</i>. Minister for the Marine as it relied on the 1972 Act for subsequent legislation. In this legislation, we make it clear that <Col N="1227"/>we are implementing EU law and providing for indictable offences simultaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not satisfied. I now understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation, but I do not agree with the approach as a matter of general policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>We also discussed this on Committee Stage and I was strongly of the view that the current system works particularly well. The deterrent element of having the matter before the High Court is of some value and it should be retained, although I accept that the Deputy made a number of strong points in favour of the amendment. However, these cases are only taken in extreme urgency and danger when the Health and Safety Authority has failed to get the cooperation of an employer. In the circumstances, it should occur at the level of the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State again sent me a briefing note subsequent to the debate on Committee Stage and I am very grateful to him for it. I am less convinced by his detailed arguments this time than I was for the last amendment. He is of the view that the hierarchical scheme for enforcement, set out in the Bill, requires the High Court to be the appropriate judicial authority for these indictments. I will not win the argument so I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 75, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(9) Where the affairs or activities of an undertaking are managed or organised in a way that fails to ensure that the health and safety of persons liable to be affected (including employees) is not thereby threat<Col N="1229"/>ened, and where such failure amounts to conduct falling far below the standard of care and attention it is reasonable in the circumstances to expect would be paid to ensuring that the health and safety of such persons is not so threatened, and where such failure is the cause or one of the causes of the death of a person (notwithstanding that the immediate cause of the person&rsquo;s death is the act or omission of another person), the undertaking (and any director or manager of the undertaking whose recklessness or gross negligence contributed to or caused the failure) shall be guilty of manslaughter.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment and I have raised this issue throughout the debate on this legislation. My intent in this new subsection is to create an offence of corporate manslaughter. This was encompassed in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill published by Deputy Rabbitte in 2001. There is a strong case for express statutory provision for the offence of corporate manslaughter. It is being examined by the Law Reform Commission and has been trenchantly supported by the trade union movement over the years. Despite reasonably good legislation, which we have before the enactment of this provision, we will have better legislation after the enactment of this provision.</P>
      <P>However, there has still been an extraordinary rise in the number of fatalities. There has been a 40% increase in the number of workplace deaths in the first four months of this year. County Wexford was one of the four black spots in the country. There were three deaths in Wexford, three deaths in a number of other counties and four deaths in Cork. It really is very worrying.</P>
      <P>The two biggest black spots for death in the work place are still in construction and in agriculture. It behoves us to do two things. First, we must enact the strongest legislation possible, consistent with practicalities. We must make it clearly known that negligence that puts people in mortal peril is a grievous offence. Where someone loses his or her life through employer negligence, the offence of corporate manslaughter will be committed. The other responsibility is to ensure that when we enact the legislation, we have adequate resources in place to ensure that it is enforced. While I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the increase of labour inspectors, their numbers are woefully inadequate to provide the safety checks that a workforce of more than 2 million requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House will be aware, this issue is being dealt with in another forum by the Law Reform Commission which has already reported on it and which is in the process of preparing another report. I understand the commission held a public seminar in late 2004 and that its further report is awaited and may be completed before the end of the year. In the absence of a definitive position from the Law Reform Commission adopted by Government, it would be <Col N="1230"/>premature to accept Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment to this legislation. I believe the impact of the Law Reform Commission report will be felt across a range of people and issues.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin with regard to the 40% increase in fatalities in the workplace in the earlier part of this year. Heretofore there had been an encouraging decrease in the numbers killed. The figures for the earlier part of this year are very worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I sympathise with the position outlined by the Minister of State in terms of the definitive proposals to be brought forward by the Law Reform Commission. However, in the absence of the recommendations, I am disposed to supporting Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment. I take on board the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that we should see what the Law Reform Commission will bring forward, but in the absence of any concrete proposal I feel I ought to support Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the view of the Law Reform Commission from its first report, which recommended the creation of such an offence. What we are waiting for now is the detail. We have a responsibility as legislators to legislate. Since the Law Reform Commission is of the view that we should have such an offence, the trade union movement is strongly of that view and most citizens would agree that negligence to such an extent that a worker dies in the place of work is a serious offence, I feel there is public support for my proposal.</P>
      <P>God knows when we will have another vehicle to put this legislation in place. We do not know whether it will be two, three or ten years before another health and safety Bill is before the House. We have one now and we know it is right to do this. All we need from the Law Reform Commission is its attitude to the detail of the offence. It behoves us as legislators to provide that detail. We do not need the Law Reform Commission to draft legislation in many areas. The Minister of State should seize the moment, he should seize this opportunity to send a signal, particularly in the backdrop of the significant rise in fatalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputies know there are far stronger provisions with regard to the responsibilities of management and directors in this legislation than in the previous legislation, which was acknowledged on Committee Stage. In the circumstances, as we have received the initial Law Reform Commission discussion document and, having heard submissions, it is preparing its final document, it would be premature to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no point in dividing the House on it. Will the Minister of State give me an assurance that once the details of the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s proposals are known, he <Col N="1231"/>will come back speedily to the House with legislative proposals in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have every confidence that when the report is prepared, a Government position will be adopted on it which will have an impact across a range of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 75, to delete lines 25 to 27.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This proposal to delete lines 25 to 27 is related to the amendment with which we have just dealt. The Bill creates a new offence of causing personal injury, including death, through contravening the Act. That is welcome because the wording of the existing legislation, the 1989 Act, is defective. However, section 77(9)(<i>b</i>)(ii) creates an opt-out in the case of personal injury, but not death. The injury must be &ldquo;directly&rdquo; caused by the contravention. That is not logical. I believe an offence of causing injury or death by means of contravening the Act is committed whether the injury is caused directly or indirectly. Accordingly, I propose to delete the opt-out clause in section 77(9)(<i>b</i>)(ii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The intent of the provision which Deputy Howlin seeks to have deleted is that a provision would be made where account would be taken of where workers had pre-existing conditions or illnesses. A number of provisions in the Bill cater more than adequately for what Deputy Howlin seeks. Section 10(1)(<i>c</i>) requires the employer to take account of workers&rsquo; capabilities in assigning work to be carried out. This is very important in the case of somebody who has a pre-existing condition, for example, asthma or back injury. This is an important provision of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Employees also have duties in this regard under sections 13(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>d</i>). This provision is a protection for both employees and employers. The Bill is better for the inclusion of the provision as it relates only to pre-existing conditions or illnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Minister of State. I think it weakens the provision. However, there is no point in taking up time fighting it. I press the amendment.</P>

      <P LI="2" FLI="0">shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to insert a new subsection 11 and I am optimistic the Minister of State will accept this amendment. The purpose of the amendment, I am advised, is to correct a drafting problem with the relationship between section 77, which is the offensive section, and section 78, the penalty section. Section 78 is intended to create penalties for the offences created by section 77 and other parts of the Bill. However, it goes on to penalise certain conduct which is not specifically made an offence by section 77. My amendment proposes to remove those provisions from section 78 &mdash; they are currently contained in section 78(2)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) &mdash; and insert them in what I have been advised is their proper place in section 77.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Following discussion on Committee Stage I sought further advice on this from the parliamentary counsel. I have been advised that the provisions for penalties in section 78(2)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) already deal expressly with breaches or non-compliance with conditions of a licence, which is what I think Deputy Howlin is saying. My advice is that they are as effective in section 78 and they achieve what Deputy Howlin seeks where they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not convinced. I think it is a case of the parliamentary draftsmen deciding to stick with what they have. My proposal would improve the Bill, but the Minister of State is not of a mind to accept it.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 76, lines 11 to 25, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 11 down to and including &ldquo;<i>paragraph (b)</i>&rdquo; in line 25 and substitute the following:</P><Col N="1233"/>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;this Act or under section 39(17)(<i>e</i>) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 as applied to this Act by <i>section 29(7)</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is twofold. It is linked to the amendment I have just discussed. It is a drafting amendment to ensure that section 77 creates an offence and section 78 provides the punishment. Second, I seek to provide for the maximum available penalty, including imprisonment, for all offences under the Act. Section 78(1) provides only for a fine for offences mentioned in section 29(4)(<i>e</i>) or section 77(1). A number of the offences such as failure to make a risk assessment could be serious and may have serious implications for workers and warrant a significant penalty, including imprisonment. The Bill provides for the soft option of a fine for such offences of not more than &euro;3,000. That is inadequate in all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to amalgamate the provision of sections 78(1) and 78(2) so that all offences, regardless of their seriousness, can be prosecuted summarily or on indictment. The section distinguishes between lesser offences, which do not give rise to a likelihood of employees being injured or killed at work, and the more serious offences, about which I agree with Deputy Howlin, which give rise to the likelihood of much more serious injury. The section further provides that lesser offences can only be prosecuted summarily and will not attract a prison sentence. Given the nature of the lesser offences, that is reasonable. They do not warrant a larger fine or imprisonment because distinguishing between the seriousness of offences is important in the context of health and safety requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek provision for a decision in each case on what is appropriate so that it would be open to the prosecuting authority to seek a higher penalty, which would be available to the court to impose. A number of the offences encompassed by the lesser model proposed by the Minister of State where the fine could be not more than &euro;3,000 could involve a serious omission, including the failure to make a risk assessment, which could result in serious harm to workers. In those circumstances, a fine of not more than &euro;3,000 is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are unlikely to reach agreement on the duration of sentences and the size of fines. I was pleased, however, that a hefty fine was imposed in court earlier. I understand the Deputy&rsquo;s point but it is important that offences that are not likely to lead to injury or death should be distinguished from other offences if only to point up the seriousness of the offences that would attract a prison sentence or a substantial fine, as in any other case. The discretion allowed under this provision is warranted.</P>

	<P>We had a long discussion in this regard on Committee Stage. The deterrent value of the maximum prison sentence of six months is as great as the 12 months proposed by the Deputy. It points up the seriousness of the offences in these cases. It is a sufficient deterrent, which was arrived at long before I became involved with the legislation following a great deal of discussion with various interest groups. Six months is a reasonable provision.</P>

	<P>Back pocket money. The fine does not represent a proper deterrent. I do not know that the courts will employ it but I would prefer to give them the option of imposing a significant fine in these cases. The courts should be given that strength because if disciplinary proceedings are brought against these corporations and compensation sought, that is the way it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 54 is related. A maximum penalty of &euro;3 million could be too low in calamitous cases involving multiple deaths caused by absolute negligence on the part of a major multinational or large conglomerate. The formula I propose is a maximum penalty of &euro;3 million or 10% of the annual turnover of the defendant as ascertained by the court, whichever is the greater, so that companies with a multi-billion euro turnover could face a hefty fine. Such a range of penalties should be considered by the Minister of State and it should be available to the <Col N="1235"/>courts so that appropriate action could be taken against companies that are completely derelict. I do not envisage this provision being used very often, if ever, but the capacity should be there so that we are not stuck when we are shocked by negligence and feel the maximum penalty available to a court is wholly inadequate in the circumstances. The formula I propose will address that shortcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be borne in mind that in all cases prosecution of a number of offences is sought and it is open to the court to impose the maximum fine on each offence. The practice in recent times is for fines to be imposed on each of the breaches of which a company is found guilty. The maximum penalty of &euro;3 million is not necessarily the highest amount a company may be required to pay in fines in particular circumstances. I like the idea of giving the court discretion. A fine of &euro;3 million on each offence in cases where five or six charges are brought against the largest companies is a considerable deterrent. The figure was arrived at following considerable consideration by Government. It is reasonable and it will send the message that needs to be sent in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State made a reasonable point but my difficulty is that multinational corporations can afford modern day Perry Masons or whizz kid defence lawyers and the prosecution of all the offences often does not succeed. If the prosecution of only one offence succeeds, the court should at least have the opportunity to impose a significant fine on the defendant. Whizz kid lawyers in other jurisdictions have brought legal argument to bear and it has become more difficult to secure a conviction on all counts. If a conviction can be secured reasonably quickly for one offence, the court should have the option to impose such a punishment. That would be a significant deterrent as well as a punishment and it should be available to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In my earlier reply I neglected Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s amendment which proposes a penalty of 10% of turnover. While initially this seemed attractive, I was advised that companies, as we are all aware, have wonderful ways of having various types of sub-companies, and it could be an onerous task to discover which company is employing who at a particular time and establish the turnover of that specific company. I am taken by the principle of linking the penalty to the capacity of the company to pay, which is what Deputy Morgan also stated with regard to large companies. Having considered all the arguments, and particularly having examined the number of successful prosecutions possible under the new legislation, I can assure Deputy Morgan that there will be successful prosecutions in many cases. Having considered this carefully since Committee Stage, <Col N="1236"/>in any case, I can envisage that &euro;3 million is a substantial penalty that is likely to work as well as any other amount as a deterrent and seems entirely appropriate in these circumstances.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 54:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 76, line 30, after &ldquo;&euro;3,000,000&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;or 10 per cent of the annual turnover of the defendant as ascertained by the court concerned, whichever is greater,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister has already responded to this, but his argument that the existence of sub-companies would mean the turnover would not be significant is addressed by the fact that it is &euro;3 million or 10% of the turnover, whichever is greater. Where the turnover is less than &euro;3 million, then the Minister&rsquo;s figure of &euro;3 million is available to the court, so that argument does not hold water.</P>
      <P>The ability to pay is an issue, as it is with speeding fines which were not a real deterrent to people driving souped-up Jaguars who did not mind paying &euro;50 on the spot fines, and I say that as the Minister who introduced them. They were a real deterrent to somebody for whom &euro;50 represented a significant chunk of his or her weekly salary. For some companies &euro;3 million is not a significant sum. Only by relating it to the capacity of the company to pay, which is its turnover, will we have a significant deterrent that makes a large company focus on and have regard for the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware that the amendment refers to 10% of the annual turnover or &euro;3 million, whichever is greater, but it seems that the companies that might not be particularly deterred by a maximum of &euro;3 million are those which are by far more likely to have a myriad of companies and sub-companies and the least likely to be caught by what the Deputy proposes. It would also involve a significant amount of work for the courts, which it would not be reasonable to impose on them, and in the circumstances &euro;3 million is the better option.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The purpose of the amendment is to increase the maximum period of imprisonment on conviction on indictment from two to ten years. Given that some of the offences could involve the loss of life of workers, two years is a ridiculously low period of imprisonment. It seems to value life cheaply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not calling for ten-year sentences in all cases. It is a question of providing the courts with the option, and it is important that the courts should have the power to impose a heavier sentence than two years where appropriate. That facility should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to increase the maximum prison sentence from two years to ten. The package of penalties provided for in the Bill has resulted from consideration of the range of offences covered in section 77 and has met with a broad welcome from most of the interest groups. Since Committee Stage I have examined the provisions in other legislation and in general the principle is that where an offence is committed arising from a deliberate act or an act of gross negligence and recklessness, legislation provides for higher sentences. It is not in the employer&rsquo;s or anybody&rsquo;s interest that such would be the case in a place of work. On balance, the exercise carried out at an earlier stage of the Bill&rsquo;s preparation which came up with the two-year maximum sentence for each charge seems reasonable, particularly when compared with the provisions in other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot agree with the Minister of State that where gross negligence results in the loss of life, it is appropriate that the penalty is two years. If I recall, gross negligence in a car resulting in death carries a penalty of at least double that, if not a higher penalty. Why should an employer who is reckless to the extent that somebody loses his or her life face a maximum penalty of two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that other legislation generally refers to two years, but when was that legislation couched? Is it time for us to increase it? Perhaps instead of examining earlier legislation we should consider what the current situation requires, which is what this amendment does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There are provisions for up to ten years of imprisonment under other legislation but in general, the principle appears to be that it applies in cases of deliberate recklessness and that would not seem to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a simple but important amendment. There was a series of measures in recent Bills that have come before the Houses to restrict the right of appeal. There is no necessity for the High Court to give an order to appeal to the Supreme Court and inserting the requirement for leave of the court is inappropriate. The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that it is the usual practice but I have checked and am advised it is false and that the general rule is that there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. Exceptions to that rule are the exception and not the usual practice. The Minister of State was wrong in saying that what he is inserting into the Bill is the norm. He is breaking the norm where the right of appeal to the Supreme Court generally falls to be the case. I have rechecked that since Committee Stage to ensure my advice was right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that it is only in cases of points of law that appeals are made from the High Court to the Supreme Court. I regret if I gave the Deputy the impression on Committee <Col N="1239"/>Stage that it is universally the case but it is very commonly the case and there are a number of examples of that. Section 38(5) of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001, section 44(6) of the Teaching Council Act 2001 and section 84(2) of the Industrial Designs Act 2001 make a similar provision. It is not unusual, therefore. My understanding is that it relates to court protocols on matters of this kind and it is the strong view of the Parliamentary Counsel that it is the case.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a drafting amendment. I am advised that it is incorrect to say that the Minister may make regulations in respect of any matters. They must be matters for the purposes related to section 58. We had some tautology in this debate. We have amended the amendments since Committee Stage to reflect the point the Minister of State made that the matters are ones to which section 58 relates.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 58(1) already sets out the parameters within which the regulations may be made under this Act. The parameters are that the regulations relating to any matter referred to in this Act or prescribed or to be prescribed are for the purposes of giving full effect to the Act or are in respect of any of the matters in Schedule 7.

	<P>I thank the Members who have participated in the debates, particularly the Opposition spokespersons who tabled many amendments and put me through my paces on Committee and Report Stages. They took a genuine interest in the Bill and I tried to respond by accepting amendments I felt would improve the legislation. I do not take the view that it is the job of Government in these circumstances to reject every amendment that comes before it and come up with something similar from the Government side. Occasionally, the drafting requires that that be the case but I greatly appreciate the interest taken by Members on Second Stage and particularly on Committee and Report Stages. We will have a better Bill for that reason.</P>
      <P>I hope to bring the Bill before the Seanad in the next week or two. At that stage there may be other amendments with which I will be required to come back to this House. One or two issues were raised on Report Stage that I intend to re-examine. I also want to thank the officials in the Department and all the people involved in making submissions on the Bill. The point was made that when work is done outside the House, it can occasionally appear to cut across the work of the Oireachtas, but it would be a mistake to ignore the fine contributions made from outside the House at an earlier stage. In some instances I have gone with them, in others I have not. Ultimately, the success of the Bill will depend on changing the existing mindset. I look forward to working with the Health and Safety Authority to ensure the Bill makes a substantial contribution, which is necessary in light of the figures for death and injuries for the earlier part of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comments. I am sure Opposition Deputies will do so also.

I commend that to the House for other Ministers to copy.</P>
      <P>I want to raise two brief issues. We will have a very robust and modern legislative framework to improve health and safety, which is clearly required with the backdrop of the 40% rise in fatalities in the workplace in the first four months of this year. All the legislation will be worthless, however, if we do not put in place an enforcement regime that will provide adequate labour inspectors to ensure compliance with the law.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that has not been the experience to date. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the open way in which they dealt with Opposition amendments.</P><Col N="1242"/>
      <P>I remarked previously about predetermined views in the House. Despite that they are, by and large, very worthwhile, we often undermine ourselves in the way we approach partnership arrangements. We should work as an Oireachtas to incorporate initiatives in the House and hold the relevant debates at committee meetings attended by outside experts. If we fail to continue to make the Oireachtas the most relevant forum for debates on legislation, we will undermine the democratic process over time.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak to this important legislation. I welcome the debate owing to our history and the connection of the people to the land. Evidence of the people&rsquo;s historic bond with the land is found in the lives of great statesmen like Michael Davitt who worked with the Land League. I pay tribute to the work he did on the land question over many years. I will try to follow his tradition in the House as it is something from which we can all learn. It is relevant to the current log-jam in the peace process, a way out of which is for the people to come together and adopt Michael Davitt&rsquo;s approach by co-operating through democratic and peaceful means.</P><?oasys _dc0-?>
      <P>It would be remiss of me in dealing with the Bill to fail to refer to land speculation and the price of housing. It is a scandal that young people cannot afford to buy houses owing to the price of land, especially in urban areas. The housing crisis, which is relevant to this debate, must be con<Col N="1243"/>fronted. Approximately 100,000 people are on local authority housing waiting lists while others attempt to buy land and build within the communities in which they grew up. Despite many negative comments from some Members, I support such people strongly. To honour everybody&rsquo;s entitlement to buy or build on family land within their own locality where possible does not necessarily imply a cost to the environment. People in rural areas need our support.</P>
      <P>We must consider the quality of planning in urban areas. We face the scandal of overdevelopment and a lack of planning, including in my constituency where blocks of apartments are built in areas in which housing has traditionally been two storeys high. I urge caution in planning and call on Ministers and those dealing with the land question to ensure we have quality in planning throughout the system.</P>
      <P>Unlike many other Deputies, I have never walked away from the issue of ground rents. I regret that the issue has not been dealt with in this legislation given its direct connection with the land. I support the highly organised campaign by the National Association of Tenants Organisations and ACRA to abolish ground rents and urge the Government to introduce legislation to meet their demands. I commend and thank Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Toole of ACRA for the work he has done on this matter.</P>
      <P>The debate is broad. Ireland has a long history of dealing with landlordism which has blighted the country. Unfortunately, many of those exploiting people today are our own, home-based landlords. As one will see from a reading of the explanatory memorandum, the Land Commission was established in 1881 as a rent fixing body under the Land Law (Ireland) Act of the same year. It developed under subsequent legislation into a tenant purchase agency and assisted with the purchase by tenants of approximately 13.5 million acres. Ultimately, the commission embarked on a countrywide programme of land structural reform and became a great purchaser and distributor of land. Acquisition of land by the commission ceased in 1983 and the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act 1992 came into operation on 31 March 1999. The property of the commission and the functions of the land commissioners were transferred to the Minister for Agriculture and Food. I pay tribute to the Land Commission, from the operations of which many people benefited, especially smaller farmers.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with land purchase and land reclamation annuities, the simplification of transfer of ownership and the amendment of various Land Acts to facilitate simpler, more efficient administration. The Bill proposes to discharge all land purchase annuities and land reclamation annuities amounting to &euro;200 or less per annum, including arrears. This will allow farmers to clear their existing land annuities at a discount of 25% sub<Col N="1244"/>ject to all outstanding arrears being paid in full. The Bill empowers the Department to set off any payments due to be made by it to a person holding an annuity against any arrears of the annuity owed by that person to the Minister and-or the Department. An important aspect of the Bill is that it provides the Land Registry with the power to refuse to register a transfer of land or part of land subject to land purchase or land reclamation annuity where the annuity is in arrears. The Land Bill provides that the Minister may, at the request of the trustees, transfer former Land Commission trust property and effect change of ownership of these properties in the Land Registry office. This additional provision is to be made subject to the provisions which already apply to the power of the Minister to authorise disposal of trust property by the trustees. Provisions are also made to give legal authority to previous Government decisions to write off small land purchase or land reclamation annuities.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;land reclamation&rdquo; reminds me of the attempt in my constituency over the last 15 years to reclaim land in Dublin Bay. As someone who has supported the efforts of Mr. Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus to save the bay, I take the opportunity presented by this debate to discuss the matter. In October 1999, Dublin Port Company Limited applied to fill in 52 acres of Dublin Bay. The application was rejected in March 2000 after independent consultants found the environmental impact statement was inadequate. On 7 March 2002, Dublin Port Company Limited reapplied to fill in the same 52 acres. The independent consultant reported on the environmental impact study in September 2002 and the application remains current.</P>
      <P>While an attempt continues to be made to build land development in Dublin Bay, every Member should support Mr. Loftus and the local committee of Dublin Bay Watch in their efforts to preserve it. I am very concerned by the lack of encouraging signs from the Department of the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. If the Minister proceeds with the application, there will be serious trouble. We will need every help to defeat the attempt to fill in 52 acres of Dublin Bay. My objective is to protect and preserve what remains of the amenities of Dublin Bay. I commend Mr. Se&aacute;n Dublin Bay Loftus, a former Member of this House, on his work in recent years, particularly on this issue. I also commend the group in which he is directly involved.</P>
      <P>It is up to the Members of this House to present alternative proposals. Other ports need to be developed. One has only to travel to County Louth to see ports such as Dundalk and Drogheda which require development. This should be done rather than overcrowding Dublin Bay. The traffic congestion in Dublin docks always amazes me. One of the largest ports in Europe is in the city centre. We should act to ease <Col N="1245"/>the congestion there. It is important to debate this matter.</P>
      <P>Another matter directly concerned with the acquisition of land in my constituency concerns the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel. Residents of Marino, Fairview, Santry and Drumcondra have suffered in recent years as a result of cracks in their houses and other damage to their homes. Currently, 178 houses in my constituency have been damaged as a result of construction work on the Dublin Port tunnel. For example, 125 houses have cracks, and a further 27 have hairline cracks. Seven houses have jammed doors and windows, one has a damaged roof and three have plumbing problems. A further three houses have developed major glazing problems while 12 other complaints have been received also. Overall, 178 houses in the Marino, Santry, Drumcondra and Santry areas have been hammered during the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
      <P>I was involved in the negotiations on this project with the city manager and the city engineer, Mr. Tim Brick. Before the project they informed me that there would be no damage to houses. When they bought the land under the houses, some of the offers they made to people were insulting. Some people in Marino were offered &euro;500 or &euro;600 for a piece of land under their houses. I know that some people received offers of &euro;5,000 but it is appalling to offer elderly pensioners &euro;500 or &euro;600 for land under their homes.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister, the Dublin city manager and Dublin City Council to examine the idea of compensating families who have suffered trauma as a result of the tunnel&rsquo;s construction. We were informed that all houses would be repaired within a 30 metre zone of the tunnel, yet damage has occurred to some houses outside that zone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I appreciate that he has been flexible in this respect. I will now focus on the legislation. Section 7 facilitates trustees in the transfer to users of former Land Commission trust property by providing the Minister with the power to arrange for the transfer of title of the entire or a part of a trust property when so requested by the trustees, relieving them of the legal and financial burden involved. At present the Minister may consent to a proposal from the trustees that they transfer the entire or a part of a trust property and the legal work necessary to effect a change of ownership in the Land Registry Office is the responsibility of the trustees. About 500 of these trusts exist and the extra powers that are proposed by the Minister in this section should greatly facilitate the transfer of these lands from trust to user ownership. I welcome this important section, particularly given that the measure will <Col N="1246"/>facilitate a greater development of sporting and other amenity facilities. Every community needs sporting amenities in addition to housing, schools and factories. Section 7 is pertinent in this regard. I would like to see more land being used to assist local communities. This is a major issue in my constituency which includes the beautiful St. Anne&rsquo;s Park. The park is for the people of Dublin North-Central and so it should remain. l never want to see greedy developers getting their hands on that park land.</P>
      <P>Section 9 removes the necessity for meetings of the rules committee consisting of the Secretary General and an assistant secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food, and the President of the High Court who exercises the jurisdictions of the former judicial commissioner. The power to make rules for carrying into effect certain of the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts is conferred on the Minister by section 3 of the Land Act 1933 but, as currently framed, the section provides that the Minister may only exercise this power with the concurrence of a majority of the rules committee.</P>
      <P>Section 10 provides a statutory base for Government decisions made in 1989 and 1992 whereby small amounts &mdash; &euro;25.40 or less per annum &mdash; in respect of land purchase annuities and land reclamation annuities were written off. While the consent of the Minister for Finance to make statutory instruments providing for the write-offs was obtained, the said statutory instruments should have been made before the write-offs took place. I welcome this section which regularises the position.</P>
      <P>Section 11 provides a statutory basis for the Government decision in 1992 which approved concessions to land purchase and land reclamation annuity payers where they were offered the opportunity to buy out their annuities at a discount provided any arrears of such annuities were also paid. However, there was no provision in existing legislation authorising the Minister to accept less than the full amount to buy out such annuities. This section regularises the position.</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides,<i> inter alia</i>, for the repeal of section 45 of the Land Act 1965. Under this section all non-qualified persons must get the written consent of an officer authorised by the Minister before acquiring an interest in agricultural land, that is, land not situated in a county borough, borough, urban district or town. This provision was introduced to prevent land in such areas from being acquired by non-Irish persons and corporate bodies. Where land was to be acquired outside these geographical definitions, a purchaser had to be a qualified person. On Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the European Community, it became obvious that the restrictions on purchases of land by non-nationals or, more specifically, by nationals of other member states, imposed by section 45 were contrary to our obligations under the Treaty of Rome. I welcome this section which <Col N="1247"/>reflects the reality of the modern, progressive world. The enlargement of the EU has and continues to broaden significantly the categories of qualifying individuals. This matter raises the debate surrounding Irish nationality in the context of the European Union and these issues will arise in the referendum campaign on the European constitution. Many people have concerns about the direction in which some Members of this House are seeking to drag them.</P>
      <P>As regards the financial implications of the legislation, the proposals in the Bill provide for a potential contribution to the Exchequer by way of a capital lump sum being paid to it and possible savings in the current administration costs of the Department. From the point of view of the Exchequer, that is an important element of the debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill. Historically, Irish people have been closely connected with the land. Thousands of people living in urban areas are descended from small farmers who moved to towns and cities in the past. That bond with the land should never be broken and there should be no divisions between urban and rural areas. Many people living in urban areas have more in common with farming and fishing communities than they have with the wealthy elite. Over the years, it has saddened me that some political parties in the House &mdash; although none of their Members is currently in the Chamber &mdash; have tried to drive a wedge between urban and rural dwellers. It is important to note that during this debate some Members of the House have sought to promote the vision of an end to the urban-rural divide. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me an opportunity to contribute to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. Over the years, various land agencies, including the Land Commission, have played a major role in restructuring land and giving farmers and tenants an opportunity to use the land to good effect. I was one of those who signed a contract with the Land Commission on 13 May 1971 to swap land as part of a major restructuring project. The pilot project in the parish of Aghabog where I lived at the time involved a large amount of land and the Land Commission did a good job in restructuring the farms in question.</P>
      <P>I thank the staff of the Land Commission, particularly those based in the Farnham Street office in Cavan. The Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, will know them well. They have done a good a job, often in difficult circumstances, trying to sort out titles and many other issues. They have always been helpful in my dealings with the office and I hope they will be dealt with in an amicable manner as part of any programme of changes. They should not be required <Col N="1248"/>to move office, for example, although I would welcome a move to County Monaghan, nor should they be placed under pressure to move against their will.</P>
      <P>While the Land Commission has worked well over the years, question marks have frequently arisen regarding the way in which various lands were divided and distributed. I make no apology for raising the possibility of political interference. I have first-hand knowledge of some of the carry-on associated with the division of land. I was promised that a farm would be divided three years hence but when it was discovered I was one of the beneficiaries, every effort was made to block the division. Another example of the negative side of land division concerned one of my uncles who had a ministerial order lodged against the disposal of his farm on the morning of the proposed sale. This removed his right to engage in the free and fair sale of his property and he was given bonds instead of money. I accept, however, that there are two sides to the argument.</P>
      <P>By the 1990s there was general agreement that the Land Commission had served its purpose. This legislation will wind up the commission as we know it. Millions of hectares of land have changed hands under its aegis. Approximately 3,500 people stand to benefit from the proposal to write off annuities below a threshold of &euro;200, a welcome measure given the small sums involved and the cost of administering the current system. It should also be noted that a commitment was made to write off annuities approximately 12 years ago.</P>
      <P>The threshold of &euro;200 per annum must be reconsidered. If it is possible to justify writing off annuities below &euro;200 per annum, it is also reasonable to remove them for those paying less than &euro;500 per annum. Will the Minister consider making such provision, particularly in light of the need to ensure the legislation is the final Bill to address this issue? We do not want to return to this issue in future, nor should we introduce enforcement orders as they would make the Government appear like the landlords of a previous era. We want the Bill to be as comprehensive as possible.</P>
      <P>While the legislation provides for the introduction of special arrangements for those paying annuities above &euro;200 per annum, it also provides that these arrangements will be curtailed if the payees in question have arrears. Lands bought before the early 1970s were sold at a reasonable rate, whereas much of the land sold in the 1980s changed hands at an extraordinarily high price and at interest rates of up to 18%. It is no longer tenable to allow this to continue. This is also true of house purchases made at the time in respect of which some people signed up for excessive interest rates. Deputies were promised that this matter would be rectified some years ago. Although the numbers affected in the area of <Col N="1249"/>housing are small, those who cannot escape the net in which they find themselves will continue to suffer. Therefore, I beg the Minister to reconsider the issue of arrears.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider capitalising arrears or other measures which would ensure that those we claim to be trying to help are given a proper opportunity to get out of the terrible circumstances in which they find themselves. Many of those in arrears bought land when it was expensive and interest rates were high. I suggest capitalising the arrears and increasing the write-off from 25% to 50%. I have not plucked this figure from the air because a previous Bill, which passed through the Houses in the early 1990s, provided for a 50% discount for those who could afford to avail of it.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to defend those who may be in arrears because they are not prepared to pay. Others, however, have a genuine reason for being in arrears and are unable to secure a deal from their bank without first being offered a realistic settlement. The House discussed the difficulties facing small farmers and the inability of those aged under 20 years to obtain grant aid. I am sure some of the people in question have arrears. They may even have destocked to pay off their debts and cannot afford to get grant aid for housing. The Minister indicated that each case would be considered on its merits. It is vital that this commitment is met. Our problem is that once the legislation is passed, people can have the book thrown at them. To avoid such circumstances the Bill must be amended to rectify the current anomaly.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>The Bill also provides for the recovery of debts by making deductions from headage payments, single payments and other sources. This is a draconian measure. In many cases these payments are a farmer&rsquo;s main source of income. I have already encountered a number of cases of deductions being made from payments. Although some improvements were made following my strong representations, we must ensure that deductions are not made automatically.</P>
      <P>I note also that deductions may also be made from third parties. Section 6 provides extensive powers to remove money from a third party, for example, in the form of creamery cheques. Frequently, the people who are in difficulty do not have bank accounts and good creameries and co-operatives are the only place they can get fertiliser, meal and so on. It will be a serious development if Land Commission annuities are deducted from their creamery cheques.</P>
      <P>This legislation provides an opportunity to rectify the matter of annuities once and for all, albeit at a cost. The write-off threshold should be increased from &euro;200 to &euro;500 per annum and arrears above this threshold should be capitalised to ensure people are not prevented from entering the scheme. It twists the farmer&rsquo;s arm to clear up arrears. Why was he in arrears? Could he go to <Col N="1250"/>the bank or building society and get this money easily? No, he is in arrears because he could not do that. If farmers are forced to pay the arrears before they can get the 25% discount, which I suggest should be 50%, many of them will not be able to do it. There must be a realistic measure to allow this to work.</P>
      <P>I was a senior member of the IFA in the 1980s and we dealt with many difficulties on farms that involved banks. When explanations were given, bankers came to sensible and realistic decisions that allowed people to move forward. I give credit to those private institutions where the usual purpose is to make profit. We should work together on this, as Government and Opposition, to ensure a realistic solution is brought about.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be changed so it addresses the arrears issue. We should look at those who are making a genuine effort to pay and their family situation. Only 2,500 farmers are in these circumstances and we can ensure everything possible is done one last time to give them an opportunity to solve this problem. The Minister has it in her hands to make the right decision on this and ensure that the changes that are necessary in the Bill are introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that 49 people are owed arrears of &euro;1 million. I do not mean we should help those who are clearly not making an effort to meet their arrears, however, I am talking about genuine people whose family circumstances dramatically changed due to sickness. To leave someone with the full debt on his hands because he cannot go to the bank to erase the arrears will not solve the problem. If he can get the discount like everyone else, the Minister is fulfilling the commitment she made to do something.</P>
      <P>Compulsory purchase orders are topical. Farmers are being forced to sell land regardless of whether they want to. The Government introduced a measure in the last budget where if two farmers on opposing sides of a road agree, they can avoid stamp duty. The Government, however, cannot run away from the commitment it made before the last election that compulsory purchase orders would be dealt with in a realistic way. Deputy Finian McGrath talked about the housing situation in Dublin, but farmers are being forced out of business by compulsory purchase orders. Their farms are being divided and it is becoming a serious problem. I was with a dairy farmer recently who was forced to sign an agreement that he could no longer allow his cattle to walk the road. His lands are on either side of the road and a tunnel is not being built for him. This is not directly related to the Bill but I must take this opportunity to raise the problems in farming that are not being taken into account by the Government and that must be addressed if farmers are to remain on the land.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to estates that are to be kept for other purposes. The green areas of Dublin, such <Col N="1251"/>as the Phoenix Park, are some of its main assets and we must ensure they are not abused.</P>
      <P>In recent years, I have dealt with the Land Commission to secure clearance for a son or daughter to build on land for which there was no title. In rural areas, we want to see people moving in but we must be wary about who comes and where they go to live. They must not raise issues about pollution and people spreading slurry. When I was in the IFA, a Meath farmer sold a site to a friend who was not able to remain there for long. The site was sold on and the person who bought it took a case against the farmer because of the noise of his milking machine and put the farmer out of business. Farmers need to be wary of planning issues and that the nitrates directive does not force them down the same road.</P>
      <P>I support the principle behind the Bill. As a person who benefited from the Land Commission in the past and will benefit to a degree from this final write-off, I welcome it. If it is to work, however, changes will have to be made. There must be an increase in the annual threshold from &euro;200 to &euro;500 and the 25% write-off should be increased to 50%, as was the case in the last Bill. Above all, the Minister must take into account those who are in arrears for genuine reasons &mdash; the land commissioners can help to decide that. If this Bill is to work and deliver what we want it to deliver that must be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Land Bill, particularly the write-off and buy-out of annuities. It paves the way for 7,000 farmers with annuities of over &euro;200 to buy out their annuities with a 25% discount if all outstanding arrears are paid in full. The Bill also provides the Minister with enhanced powers to seek recovery of outstanding land purchase annuity arrears after the operation of the buy-out scheme proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It gives the Department the power to off-set payments due to an individual against the annuity arrears owed by him or her and enhances debt collection through the aegis of the courts. If a more generous discount was given and a full year allowed for repayment, both farmers and the Exchequer would be happy.</P>
      <P>Many farmers, particularly the smaller ones will be affected by this Bill. To redress farm fragmentation, it must be ensured that anyone who purchased land beside his or her holding and sold an out-farm through someone else must not be penalised by any taxation on that transaction. If there was a capital buy-out percentage of 50%, particularly for those with capital outstanding of &euro;6,000, it would be much more significant than is contained in the Bill and encourage more people to participate. A 25% level will not allow this objective to be achieved. The Bill gives strong powers to the Department of Agriculture and Food to recoup payments. Will the Minister of <Col N="1252"/>State allow for more discounts of up to 50% similar to those in place in 1992?</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the 1950 Land Act will be amended providing the Minister with greater powers to transfer land subject to a trust set-up under the Land Acts. I hope this will result in transfer of trust land to user groups, as there are approximately 500 Land Act trusts still in existence. In particular I hope it will facilitate the transfer to GAA clubs of approximately 250 GAA grounds still held in trust under the Land Acts.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals primarily with better administration of annuities, even in the transfer of trust lands, reducing bureaucracy and reducing the costs of conveyancing transactions on all agricultural land. The Bill may meet one commitment to the farming sector in the partnership process under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and Sustaining Progress. It is designed to achieve several other objectives that blow in the way of farmers. We must have full guarantees that the proposed scheme to allow farmers with land purchase annuities of more than &euro;200 per annum to buy them out will be introduced. If the remaining farmers who have land purchase annuities take final steps towards fully owning their land, the primary objective of the former Land Commission will have been achieved, namely, tenant ownership of agricultural holdings and full unburdened title to the land that all the advantages of full ownership entail. Some 2,300 farmers will be able to avail of this concession to redeem their annuities at a substantial discount of 25%, subject to their annuity payments being up to date.</P>
      <P>While I welcome these provisions in the Bill, the Minister of State has it in his power to make rural Ireland more vibrant, particularly the west and the small farmers there. The Land Commission was a great loss to small farmers. When it existed, the larger farmer could not take over land by outbidding the smaller farmer. The small family farm is now becoming a thing of the past. We all recall Michael Davitt and the Land War when families were evicted on Christmas night. This was desperate because the people love their land and farming. Several summers ago, the committee on the Constitution examined the constitutional provisions for property rights to make it easier for people to buy sites for houses and build on their own land. What has happened to the report? It is lying in a Minister&rsquo;s office gathering dust. Will the same happen to the committee&rsquo;s deliberations on the constitutional provisions for family rights? Is the committee wasting its time?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State make inquiries as to why the property rights Bill has not yet been introduced? A Deputy from Cork asks on nearly every Order of Business when the ground rents Bill will be introduced. I do not believe it will ever be. Land reclamation grants were available to small farmers to reclaim land through drainage schemes, forestry clearance and so on. However, <Col N="1253"/>the grant was abolished, placing an enormous burden on small farmers. Will the Minister of State consider reintroducing reclamation grants? Some roads ran two miles from some farmhouses. Now, through compulsory purchase orders, the roads run next to the gable ends of the houses. There is no compensation available for the nuisance this causes.</P>
      <P>Large tracts of land belonging to no one are held in the Land Registry office. Will the Minister of State investigate providing this land to small farmers if no one claims it? The Bill states that only a qualified person can buy land. However, I see no restrictions in place as anyone can buy land. Those who wish to build one-off houses on their land are deprived of doing so by planners. Is this fair and just? Parts of west Clare have been denuded of their population. The Milltown Malbay council area was abolished because the population had been greatly reduced by people fleeing rural life. Many now want to return to their communities but obstacles are put in their way by planners. People, some mentally unstable, were unable to fill out forms and did not know their rights. Now they are being penalised.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State is a level-headed man. Will he inquire into all these matters I have raised to ensure justice is done? Part-time farmers are being discriminated against. I know of one farmer with an off-farm income. The farmer wanted to receive the installation aid for young farmers grant. However, as his employer could not give him time off to put in so many hours of farming training, he is now denied this grant. That gentleman is simply trying to make a go of farming. Several years ago the Government encouraged part-time farming but now it is penalising those farmers.</P>

	<P>In the past the Government encouraged farmers to establish forest plantations. Now those who did so are being penalised because if they cannot get back 50% of their holdings to retain their entitlements, they must rent land. The Government must help farmers over the bias against them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has the <i>force majeure</i> asset at this disposal. By giving them money under <i>force majeure</i>, he will help farmers who had to sell their livestock in the last year without premiums. In a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled before Christmas, a hint was given that this would be introduced. However, I do not see it happening. Will the Minister ensure that modulation fund is used to the best advantage, particularly for suckler farmers?</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">I propose to share time with Deputies Cowley, McGrath, McHugh, Cuffe and Crowe.</P>
      <P>To date, a considerable part of the suicide debate in Ireland has centred on horrifying statistics, with the use of which I feel increasingly uncomfortable. It is almost as if the shocking road traffic death toll is being legitimised to make a comparison with suicide deaths. Neither type of death is acceptable, nor is there an acceptable level of death in either circumstance. Sudden death in any form has devastating consequences, no matter what house it enters.</P>
      <P>Death rates from suicide are not driven home to the same extent as road traffic deaths, regard<Col N="1256"/>ing which we are presented with a weekly head count, regular bank holiday warnings and road carnage being reported faithfully in the media. Do we have the same weekly pattern of carnage with suicide? Nobody knows, because we do not have the same preoccupation with this silent killer, merely receiving an annual summary. Again we are back to the issue of statistics.</P>
      <P>Regarding the road traffic mortality-suicide comparison, we have no forewarning of a road traffic death, but we have warning signs of suicide. The real tragedy is that society is failing to note the warning signs and symptoms which should enable preventive measures to be taken to help reduce the incidence of suicide. I call for a full audit of each recorded suicide to enable us to understand the full circumstances of each suicide and to prevent further suicides.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Hard questions need to be asked. Did an individual seek professional help? Did he or she present at an accident and emergency unit, or show signs or symptoms of depression? Had there been a previous parasuicide or self-harm incident? Did he or she express concern to an individual or family member, or seek psychiatric assistance? If so, what was done about the problem?</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>Currently, a suicide is followed by a post-mortem, and later a hearing at a Coroner&rsquo;s Court. That is all, in effect. One moves on to the next business. That is not acceptable. We need an audit. If people need to be held accountable, so be it.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>Regarding funding, how can anyone justify the expenditure of a mere 8% of a road safety awareness budget on suicide prevention programmes? That is not enough, nor is it logical. Does a correlation exist between the alarming increase in suicides, now running at ten per week, and the steep reduction in the mental health budget from 11% to less than 7%?</P>
      <P>I can offer a concrete example of underfunding in the case of an eight year old child whose parents were concerned and knew the child needed an assessment. They sought a psychological assessment of their child, only to be told that only absolute emergencies, involving an immediate risk or threat to the child&rsquo;s life, could be catered for at that time. It is not acceptable for an eight year old child to be left in such a situation. Must we wait until a child&rsquo;s life is clearly at risk? Early detection, early treatment and better outcomes are needed.</P>
      <P>A German project has recently been tested in Cork and Kerry and is to be welcomed. It has four dimensions. An enlightened GP workshop points out the warning signs and symptoms of suicide. People who have been involved in self-harm are targeted first. Key professionals are then trained. They can be social workers, garda&iacute;, priests or teachers. A public awareness campaign is then instituted. This project was introduced in Nuremburg in Germany resulting in a 26% reduction in self-harm incidents while in <Col N="1257"/>W&uuml;rzburg, over the same period, there was a 24% increase in such incidents.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.2-?><P>An Australian project involved different initiatives which led to a 30% reduction in self-harm and suicide incidents in Australia. A Canadian project also resulted in a reduced incidence of suicide. There are projects in operation which have worked, yet we are testing them on a pilot basis. It is as if we are unsure that they will work in Ireland even though they have worked worldwide. I do not see why they should not work here. It is like suggesting we re-invent the wheel. If something works in Germany, Australia or wherever, let it work here. We should implement the Cork-Kerry programme nationwide.</P>
      <P>Most of us think of health as a physical manifestation in terms of people looking well, but there is also a mental dimension. Physical health can be quite apparent. We can see when someone is ill, or has a broken arm. We wish such people well, and they get our sympathy. We can also see when people are not looking well, and quite often, before people go to a doctor or seek help, prompts come from a spouse or family member. It is older men who need such prompting. In the mental health field, however, signs and symptoms are not seen. How can one prompt someone if one cannot see if he or she is well or not? One cannot know what is going on in a person&rsquo;s mind and one has no way of telling a mentally unwell person to seek help. The motivation of such people to seek help is greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>I call on the Government to take some action which will save lives and to take the Cork-Kerry project countrywide. The media are doing a good job in recent times &mdash; I have been monitoring them in terms of how they highlight suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important motion. The Government&rsquo;s primary care strategy envisaged a comprehensive primary service which among other activities would help prevent suicide. However, the Government has failed miserably to invest in the primary care strategies promised, and the cost is the loss of young and old lives.</P>
      <P>The primary care strategy promised &euro;1.3 billion over ten years, or &euro;130 million annually. That was to be a tenth of the overall health strategy budget. The Government recognised, correctly, the structural and human resource deficit in primary care and that funding of &euro;1.3 billion was realistic. However, it only gave &euro;18 million over three years compared with the &euro;1.3 billion or &euro;130 million every year for ten years that was proposed.</P>
      <P>The primary care strategy envisaged a comprehensive primary care service whereby general practitioners would not act in isolation but as part of a team. Clinical psychologists and counsellors would be part of the primary care team within a primary care setting. This would act as a safety net or sentinel service to pick up people showing danger signs such as the desire to commit suicide.</P><Col N="1258"/>
      <P>Suicide in older people is a serious matter. Older people who say they will commit suicide are likely to be successful. They do not mess about but kill themselves. There is a terrible scarcity of psychiatric social workers, which is due to a lack of resources. I put down a parliamentary question on this issue and was horrified by the reply. There are few social workers for older people; they are as rare as hen&rsquo;s teeth. The cost is terrible.</P>
      <?oasys _dc20-?><P>General practitioners are catering for the majority of the population but funding deficits are costing lives, both young and old, through suicide. While communication between the general practitioner, the public health nurse and the community psychiatric nurse is well developed in rural areas, it is not so well developed in urban areas. There is insufficient access to counsellors. There is no direct general practitioner access as the GP must go through the psychiatric service. Try getting access to the psychiatric service on a Friday evening. These personnel should be part of the primary care scheme.</P>
      <?oasys _dc0-?><P>General practitioners and district nurses are under pressure from the large volume of work relating to chronic illness, due to earlier discharges from hospitals. They are trying to keep people at home to avoid the terrible calamity of trolley chaos in the hospitals. General practitioners need time to focus on the young, particularly young males, to identify those under pressure. These can be referred directly to a counsellor in the area. This would create a culture of caring, where people have time to care and to listen. However, that cannot happen when there is a lack of resources to enable general practitioners to carry out these tasks. It is important to have a system that allows access to paramedics for people under pressure.</P>
      <P>We need resources but we are not getting them. We need an increased number of general practitioners, paramedics and allied health professionals, such as counsellors. When one looks at the graph showing the alarming increase in suicide incidence in Ireland, particularly among young people, from 1972 to 2000, as reported by the strategic task force on alcohol, it is exactly mirrored by a graph showing the increase in alcohol consumption. Alcohol abuse is a significant risk factor in suicide and compounds other risk factors.</P>
      <P>There has been a sharp increase in male suicides, especially among the 15 to 29 years age group. Overall, it is the main cause of death in men from 15 to 35 years of age. Alcohol disorder continues to be the main cause of admissions to psychiatric hospitals, especially for males. If this upward trend in alcohol consumption continues, Ireland will have the highest rate of consumption in Europe and the suicide rate will go through the roof.</P>
      <P>A coroner told me recently that in seven out of the ten recent inquests he had conducted on <Col N="1259"/>young people&rsquo;s suicides the deaths were alcohol related and many of the people had no history of depressive illness. They tended to be impulsive. Few of the deaths were anticipated and the relatives suspected nothing. Suicide often occurred after a disco when, after some late night drinking, the person threw himself over the bridge because he was refused a dance at a disco. That is what we are dealing with. The coroner also blamed extended licensing hours and exemptions. This is about buying time. Closing time was 11.30 p.m. but it is now 1.30 a.m. There must also be enforcement of the off-licence regulations relating to tracing drink sold to under age drinkers.</P>
      <P>There are no longer any religious scruples about suicide. People drink at a younger age. When I was young, if a young man was drunk on a bus it was a sensation. We did not have the money for drink. These days, young people have the money.</P>
      <P>We do not have the money we need to do the job that must be done in primary care to prevent suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the motion put forward by the Independent Deputies. I thank and commend my Independent colleagues, especially Deputy Connolly, for their work on this urgent issue. Once again, we have shown that Independent Members can work together on important issues that matter to the public.</P>
      <P>Suicide is a huge and complex subject and we must unite, regardless of political affiliation, to do something urgently for the families directly affected. I clearly remember attending the funerals of three of my past pupils in a ten day period. The sad thing is that this did not make the headlines. Imagine three young men dying as a result of suicide and drugs related problems in a period of ten days in a small community on the northside of Dublin. That is the sad reality for the families.</P>
      <P>In our motion, we demand action from the Government to address the issue of mental health in a realistic, relevant and age appropriate manner. It is simply not good enough that there were 444 suicide deaths last year and 11,200 attempted suicides. It is also not good enough that people do not have access to support and back up services. We now have the scandal of the slashing of the mental health budget to 6.8% of the total health budget from its 1997 level of 11%, despite the problem continuing to claim more lives annually.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of suicide and the scale of its incidence has been prominent recently. All the evidence and the advice of experts point to the urgent necessity for a comprehensive mental health promotion strategy. I welcome the fact that such a strategy is currently being planned. Information and support for children, parents and <Col N="1260"/>teachers in identifying emotional and behavioural problems and early intervention services and programmes, as promised in the national children&rsquo;s strategy, are also urgently required. It is essential that the Government and the Minister for Health and Children give this issue priority.</P>
      <P>We need to challenge strongly young people&rsquo;s attitudes to and misconceptions about mental illness. We also need to critically examine society&rsquo;s attitudes to mental illness and the factors that influence such attitudes.</P>
      <P>This is an important motion and I urge Deputies to unite behind it. We are putting this issue on the political agenda and we support Deputies in other parties who feel strongly about it. It is most important that all Deputies support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Independent Deputies and the Technical Group for putting forward this motion. I particularly thank Deputy Connolly for his work on it. I also acknowledge the work Deputy Neville has done on this issue over many years and I welcome his attendance at this debate.</P>
      <P>Much of the discussion this evening relates to statistics. However, in the case of suicide, when a person becomes a statistic it is too late. No amount of talk will bring a person back. For that reason, I wish to highlight the importance of identifying the warning signs and symptoms. In many cases, these signs and symptoms are clear in hindsight but that is of no use when the person&rsquo;s life is gone. How often have we heard relatives of suicide victims say that before the death occurred they did not notice anything unusual in the person&rsquo;s behaviour? On reflection, however, after the tragic event, they see there were events, utterances or actions which were signs and symptoms but they did not recognise them as such at the time. That is the tragedy.</P>
      <P>In many cases, the signs and symptoms are visible but the caring, loving parents, partners and relatives, through no fault of theirs, just do not recognise them. The fact that close associates miss the warning signs illustrates the great and immediate need to focus on those signs and symptoms, to conduct research and to prepare programmes, both visual and audio, for presentation to people in peer groups spanning all ages at various suitable locations in a co-ordinated manner. Such programmes would be informative, educational and stimulate discussion not only among people who have been affected by suicide but those who have not been affected by it. They might have more to gain from such programmes.</P>
      <P>To provide programmes for health professionals and people working in this area on signs and symptoms is only one approach. Equally important is the need to make this information available to parents, guardians and the general public. Many of the people who commit <Col N="1261"/>suicide did not present before health professionals.</P>
      <P>I have concentrated on the absence of visible or recognisable signs and symptoms, which is hard to deal with. Sometimes those signs are visible but parents and relatives are reluctant to broach the subject with the person concerned in case it would make him or her more likely to commit suicide. We need to send the message out loud and clear this evening that to talk to people at risk of suicide can help, not harm. Studies show that it appears to ease distress and it might make some people less likely to act on suicidal thoughts.</P>
      <P>Suicide accounts for 50% more deaths annually than road accidents. Last year there were 444 suicides compared to 293 road deaths. The lack of action by Government in regard to suicide is inexcusable. I urge that the recommendations of the 1998 report of the national task force on suicide be implemented immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Independent Deputies for bringing this motion to the House. Sadly it is a timely one but it is also an appropriate one to remind us that much research has been done in this area and conclusions have been drawn, but the resources in terms of finance and staffing are required. It is high time the Government gave more resources to assisting the various agencies that assist people who may be vulnerable or families who have suffered from suicide.</P>
      <P>There is incredible pressure today, especially on younger people. As people look around them very often they see success stories, they see young people who have done well in life, who have got the right job, a car and a home, but there are many people left behind in today&rsquo;s Ireland. There are many people who find it difficult to confide to their friends that they have not been a success, that they have not succeeded in college, work life or social life. I suspect that the resources are not there for these young people who find it difficult to express themselves socially. There can be great financial pressure on those who have not been lucky enough to get on to the housing ladder when the time was right. When they see success stories all around them, it can lead them into a cycle of depression and despair. It is crucial that we provide resources and reach out to those young people.</P>
      <P>It is important for society to think long and hard about the needs of people in their teens and early 20s. We should not put too much pressure on them to behave fully as adults. If we put too much pressure on young people in this way we will not allow them to be themselves. Young people should be healthy and happy and we should allow them to live their lives in this way. We should not pigeon-hole them, whether it be by gender, culture, socio-economic status, sexual orientation or otherwise.</P><Col N="1262"/>
      <P>Pressure also comes from other angles. The advertising industry bombards us with message upon message saying that one can have that car, one should have that drink and one can use money to achieve success. We must look at the various areas where pressure is applied. We should tone down some of the advertising that tells us that success is based on material goods. We should also tone down some of the messages that are coming at young people from society.</P>
      <P>We must examine carefully the research that has been carried out. We should ensure that there are people to listen when times are tough and we should look at the groups who are most vulnerable and give them assistance. We should put forward the idea of a healthy lifestyle free from alcohol and other drugs. We should make sure that if people are using drugs such as alcohol they have a helping hand available to them.</P>
      <P>Much work remains to be done in the area of resources. The State must provide more sporting facilities and amenities for young people. The young people in my area are crying out for a skate park but it is an uphill struggle to get funding for it. It is far easier to get funding for roads or other issues than to get for the things this particularly vulnerable group from their mid-teens to their early 20s require. I accept that transportation is crucial in ensuring that, among other things, people have ways of accessing their social life.</P>
      <P>There is great pressure on young people to live up to the expectations that come through the messages from advertising and other areas. I applaud the wording of the motion. I urge the Government to live up to the recommendations of the task force that were made six or seven years ago. We need to see more progress in regard to them. In particular, funding must be provided to deliver youth services in the areas of arts, sports and education to give younger people a better chance in life. The Green Party supports the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>An OECD study in 2002 placed Ireland second in the world&rsquo;s league table of people under 25 taking their own lives. As the motion states, it is the most common cause of death among young people between the ages of 15 and 24. Ireland has the highest suicide rate in the EU for this age group. The number of people killed on the roads has often been described as a national emergency, but suicide rates far exceed road deaths. The suicide rate is a significant social problem which must be addressed by public representatives and service providers in a concentrated and co-ordinated way.</P>
      <P>The motion calls on the Government to implement the recommendations of the 1998 task force on suicide. The fact that the report contained 86 recommendations shows the complexity of this issue. While mental illness is the single biggest factor involved, there is no common cause <Col N="1263"/>of suicide. Two things strike one on looking at the statistics. First, the concentration of suicide among young boys and young men is remarkably high, which is disturbing. Second, while there are common factors among this age group the circumstances, personal and social issues of the victims are many and varied. What is clear is that social factors play a huge role in many cases. For many young people, unemployment, alcoholism, physical and sexual abuse and relationship breakdown are factors which have been shown to contribute to this tragedy.</P>
      <P>It has been noted that suicide rates tend to be higher outside the Dublin area. Various theories have been advanced to explain this but the most plausible one is that while services for people in need of counselling or those experiencing crises in their lives are thin on the ground in Dublin, they are more accessible there than in other parts of the country. Surely this shows the stark need for better and more accessible services.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon of copycat or cluster suicides has been recognised. This is where one tragedy leads directly to others within a group of young people. I am aware of a recent example of this. Only last week, relatives bereaved by the devastating legacy of suicide held a protest outside a health trust meeting in west Belfast to highlight the alarming rise in suicide incidents. These families stated that the problem has become increasingly severe in recent months and pleaded with health officials to provide support for this crisis. According to local community workers, at least 15 people have taken their own lives in north and west Belfast in the past three months. Support organisations have been inundated with calls from frightened families requesting further information, support and referrals.</P>
      <P>One of the latest victims is young Stephen McComb who was only 19 years of age when he took his life on Tuesday, 26 April. His loss is the latest tragedy for the McComb family who have endured a series of terrible and traumatic deaths in recent years. Stephen&rsquo;s 15 year old cousin, Debbie McComb, was struck and killed by so-called joyriders as she crossed the Springfield Road in west Belfast in March 2000. In May of last year, Debbie&rsquo;s grieving 19 year old brother, Michael, took his own life.</P>
      <P>His 18 year old girlfriend, Fiona Barnes, also died at her own hands, soon after the burial. In a statement last week, members of the devastated family said they were suffering terrible and inexplicable agony. For this community, it is another tragic loss of life, the statement said, and they prayed that Stephen&rsquo;s passing could, in some way, be a source of benefit to others &ldquo;in that it will finally force a meaningful response to deal with the crisis of self-harm&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust has been repeatedly criticised for not tackling the issue of self-harm and suicide in <Col N="1264"/>an effective way. Again, we can mirror that with criticism of the services here. Last week, many of the bereaved families turned up at the trust&rsquo;s monthly meeting to highlight their demands. The Lenadoon Community Forum, west Belfast, estimated that there have been at least 15 suicides in the past three months in north and west Belfast. These are only the cases that are known about. The forum runs a local community counselling project and before Christmas there were 100 clients coming in each week, about 80% of whom were referred by general practitioners and psychiatric nurses. This project has lost three of its workers due to cutbacks in funding.</P>
      <P>North and south of this island, mental health services and suicide prevention awareness programmes are being disgracefully neglected and underfunded. Gerry Adams, MP for west Belfast, in response to the problem, said:</P>
      <P LI="1">If suicide is a national disaster in Ireland we urgently need a national disaster plan. That must be a priority. The health Departments in Belfast and Dublin must begin to realise that the public want urgent strategic action on suicide prevention.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I echo that call tonight. I have spoken about Stephen McComb. From my own experience, I know of the case of Darren Bolger in my area, a 17 year old who committed suicide. There were other young people in the Kilnamanagh area who went down the same route. The Bolger family and a group of friends have come together to set up an action programme, Team Line. Young people can ring the team line and possibly speak to someone their own age who has been through a trauma, and I hope that will help. This initiative has brought that community together. Supports have been put in place. The group has premises and so forth. If young people find themselves in those circumstances, there are places they can go and people whom they can contact. I appeal to them to contact the relevant services. There are services in Cork and other centres as well.</P>
      <P>The other night in Jobstown another elected representative and I attended a meeting of 60 people. The stories were all similar, all the people were grieving and looking for supports, trying to move beyond their tragedies. A friend of mine killed himself last year. Were it not for the work that he and others in that community did for me, I would not be in Leinster House. He was coming around to me that morning. I spoke at his funeral and we discussed the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo;, what if one had done this or that. One of the messages to emerge from that meeting with the local people was that the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; need to be put in the grave with the person who has killed himself or herself. There is no understanding what has happened. Clearly people need help.</P>
      <P>My friend who killed himself had tried to commit suicide the week before. He would not take a tablet if his life depended on it. However, he <Col N="1265"/>took tablets and drink on this occasion, ended up in the local hospital and was released, for some strange reason, the next day. There were no resources or back-up services. His family tried to keep him in the house and so on. We are still suffering and trying to live with that grief. His wife and family have to live with it.</P>
      <P>I urge the Government to support this motion. The point must be made that the problem can effectively be addressed. Suicide, of course, can never be completely eliminated, but experience in other countries has shown that with proper planning, resources and services, and determination on the part of policy makers, lives can be changed and many families spared the grief of the death of a loved one.</P>

      <P>I thank the Independent group for tabling this motion. As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, I believe that the more focus there is on this issue the better. As many of the speakers from the group have said, the whole area of suicide is very complex. The more we <Col N="1266"/>focus on it and can convey its seriousness to the public, the more effectively we can get to the heart of the problem in terms of putting the message across.</P>
      <P>I stress at the outset that the Government shares the concern expressed on the opposite side of the House and among the public generally about the level of suicide. The problem of suicide has indeed become a serious one in Ireland. Suicide is in every case a tragedy, for the life that has ended and the family, friends and community left behind. It is a serious social problem. We cannot ignore or be complacent about the growing incidence of suicide and self-harm. Suicide prevention is an issue with which we must all be concerned. The challenge of preventing and reducing the rate of suicide is one of the most urgent issues facing Irish society at present and I welcome the opportunity this evening&rsquo;s debate presents for me to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>In 1998, the year in which the report of the task force on suicide was published, the number of deaths by suicide registered by the Central Statistics Office reached an all-time high of 504, reinforcing the need for sustained and co-ordinated action in response to the ongoing problem. Five years later in 2003, 444 deaths from suicide were registered. While this drop is encouraging, it is too soon to draw any firm conclusions from the reduction. What the figures indicate is that no effort can be spared to reduce what is still a major cause of death, particularly among young people. There has been a significant increase in the rate of suicide among young males in the past decade, with 305 such deaths in 1994, rising to 358 in 2003.</P>
      <P>However, it is important to point out that, contrary to what is stated in the Opposition motion, youth suicide in Ireland is not the highest in the EU. The most recent analysis suggests it is fifth highest. In terms of the overall suicide rate, Ireland ranks 17th in the EU. Recent figures suggest that the rate has stopped rising, but we experienced probably the fastest rising rate in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s, albeit from a low base rate. These are all worrying trends which require further research so that better strategies are developed to help people who are particularly at risk.</P>
      <P>The health strategy, Quality and Fairness &mdash; A Health System for You, included a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years. Work is now well under way on the preparation of a national strategy for action on suicide prevention. This strategy is being prepared by the project management unit of the HSE in partnership with the national suicide review group and supported by the Department of Health and Children. Work was initiated on the development of a national strategy for action on suicide prevention two years ago. Since that time, nearly 700 people have attended regional and national consultation meet<Col N="1267"/>ings. Submissions were sought in the national press and 68 submissions were received. A national and international expert group of 16 people reviewed the strategy during the past two weeks of April and their analysis is currently being incorporated. The extent of consultation, the input of the external reviewers and a dedicated writing team will result in a high-quality, action focussed, evidence based strategy which will highlight immediate priority actions, targets for implementation in the medium term and longer term objectives for suicide prevention and mental health promotion in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A fundamental aim of the new strategy will be to prevent suicidal behaviour, including deliberate self harm, and to increase awareness of the importance of good mental health among the general population. Ongoing multi-disciplinary research will be an essential strand of the strategy and findings will be of greatest value where they can inform and stimulate action and service development. The strategy will identify expected outcomes and set targets that can be measured, monitored and revised. Continuous quality control and ongoing modification and improvement of the strategy will be central to its implementation.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998, the Government has provided a cumulative total of more than &euro;17.5 million towards suicide prevention programmes and for research. This includes funding to support the work of the health boards, the national suicide review group, the Irish Association of Suicidology and the National Suicide Research Foundation for its work in the development of a national parasuicide register. My Department also supports the ongoing work of many organisations such as Mental Health Ireland, GROW, AWARE and Schizophrenia Ireland in raising public awareness of mental health issues. The figure of &euro;17.5 million does not encompass funding provided by other Departments such as the Departments of Education and Science, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform in addressing areas within their responsibility, as identified in the report of the national task force on suicide.</P>
      <P>My Department has also made significant additional funding available in recent years to develop further mental health specialties such as liaison psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services. These services can assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Figures recently published by Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al indicate that a total of 87 additional consultant psychiatric posts have been approved since 1997.</P><Col N="1268"/>
      <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive is required to manage and deliver health and personal social services. In accordance with the legislation, the allocation of funding for suicide prevention and research is now a matter for the Health Service Executive. An additional &euro;15 million revenue funding is being made available this year for the further development of mental health services including suicide prevention measures. Details of this allocation are being finalised by the Health Service Executive at the moment.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the report of the national task force on suicide in 1998, there has been a positive and committed response from both the statutory and voluntary sectors towards finding ways of tackling the tragic problem of suicide. The former health boards played a major role in coordinating efforts to help reduce the level of suicide and parasuicide here. Following the publication of the task force report, resource officers were appointed in all the former health board areas with specific responsibility for implementing the recommendations of the task force. The resource officers also engage in the promotion of positive mental health, the de-stigmatisation of suicide and provide information on suicide and parasuicide within their area. The health boards established the national suicide review group in 1999, in response to the recommendations of the task force report. Membership of this group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. Its main responsibilities are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to coordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations.</P>
      <P>The annual report of the national suicide review group meets the requirement of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, that the Minister for Health and Children will report annually to this House on the measures taken to prevent suicides in the previous year. The report outlines the measures taken by health service providers and other agencies in the previous year to help prevent suicide and reduce the impact of suicidal behaviour. The aim of the report is to facilitate the sharing of information across the health and other sectors regarding suicide prevention projects and to provide accurate and current information on the patterns of death by suicide in Ireland. The report draws attention to the many initiatives being undertaken around the country in the area of suicide prevention.</P>
      <P>Among the developments highlighted is the appointment of a liaison psychiatric nurse to the accident and emergency departments of many general hospitals to deal with people who present following attempted suicide. The provision of this type of service ensures that psychological problems in patients presenting to general hospitals are dealt with promptly and referred to the men<Col N="1269"/>tal health services for further support if necessary. This benefits the patient but also ensures a more efficient use of medical and surgical services in accident and emergency departments. Other initiatives highlighted in the report include the provision of training to health service staff and public information campaigns.</P>
      <P>The importance of exploring the causes and ways of dealing with suicide cannot be over emphasised. A suicide is a tragic and shattering occurrence that not only brings a life to an untimely end but has a devastating impact on family and friends. It is important to ensure that the public are informed about the high rates of suicide, especially among young people, as well as ways of preventing it. Preventing suicide means, in a corrective and constructive way, influencing a person&rsquo;s development and their own resources at different phases of life. An important aspect of suicide prevention is to promote self-esteem and self-confidence and to ensure that all young people develop personal and social skills. Children and young people need support in gaining control over their lives and coping with their problems. There are numerous regional initiatives currently being run by the Health Service Executive in conjunction with non-statutory organisations, which focus on mental health issues like stress management, depression, stigma reduction and suicide related matters. These are issues of paramount importance, which require further attention to ensure that positive mental health and the well-being of people is promoted.</P>
      <P>Many of the recommendations of the task force require continuous development particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. The work to date in this area has been reviewed in the context of the preparation of the new national strategy.</P>
      <P>Best international practice currently suggests that suicide prevention programmes should be developed on the basis of improving the mental health of the general population, in combination with developing strategies for known high-risk groups.</P>
      <P>The new strategy for action on suicide prevention will provide specific recommendations for action in this area.</P>
      <P>I would like to touch on the issue of support for those who are bereaved by suicide. We need to do all we can to make it as easy as possible for those people who are bereaved by suicide to confront and deal with the situation so that they can learn to get on with their lives. People often do not want to ask for help as they may feel that this will be perceived as a sign of weakness. Looking for and expecting practical help is not a sign of weakness, it is confronting one&rsquo;s problems. Everyone can learn to cope with a tragic loss, but for some people this can be a long and difficult process. The encouragement and support provided by the various organisations that work with <Col N="1270"/>those who suffer the intense trauma of bereavement through the suicide of a loved one is of immense importance. This has been recognised by the Government through the provision of financial support for groups active in this area.</P>
      <P>The National Suicide Research Foundation was founded in January 1995 by the late Dr. Michael Kelleher. It consists of a multi-disciplinary research team with contributions from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, psychiatry and sociology. The primary aims of the foundation are to define the true extent of the problem of suicidal behaviour in Ireland, to identify and measure the factors which protect against suicidal behaviour and to develop strategies aimed at preventing suicidal behaviour. Much of the foundation&rsquo;s work to date has involved the monitoring of parasuicide.</P>
      <P>International studies have found parasuicide to be one of the most significant risk factors associated with suicide. Those who engage in parasuicide are 20 times more likely to eventually kill themselves. Studies have shown that at least one third of all suicides have a history of parasuicide. The National Parasuicide Registry is a national system of population monitoring for the occurrence of parasuicide. This important project is undertaken by the National Suicide Research Foundation, with funding from the Department of Health and Children. As a result of the National Suicide Research Foundation&rsquo;s reputation for high quality research, it has been invited to participate in several important international studies, among them the WHO-Euro multi-centre study of parasuicide.</P>
      <P>In December last year I launched the third annual report of the National Parasuicide Registry. The findings in this report indicate that approximately 8,800 individuals presented to hospital due to deliberate self-harm in 2003. Some of these people presented more than once, accounting for the total figure of 11,200 presentations in 2003. The report indicates that, as in 2002, drug overdosing was the most common method of self-harm, representing more than 78% of all parasuicide acts registered in 2003. While it was common for several drugs to be taken in the same act, it is interesting to note that minor tranquilisers, paracetamol and anti-depressants were involved in almost all these cases.</P>
      <P>Legislation restricting the sale of medicines containing paracetamol was phased in following enactment in October 2001. The registry has shown that paracetamol-containing medicines were involved in almost the same proportion of intentional drug overdose acts in 2003 &mdash; 31% &mdash; as in 2002 &mdash; 30%. However, the report notes that further detailed analyses are required to assess the effects of the Irish legislation on the use of paracetamol in deliberate overdose acts.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, the level of discussion and openness on mental health issues, including deliberate self-<Col N="1271"/>harm and suicide, has increased in recent years. This is a welcome development. However, we need to ensure that public discussion and media coverage of suicide and deliberate self-harm remain measured, well informed and sensitive to the needs and well-being of psychologically vulnerable and distressed individuals in our society. In particular, we need to continue to work as a society to create a culture and environment where people in psychological distress feel able to seek help from family, friends and health professionals.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that the Government shares the public concern about the levels of suicide. The national strategy for action on suicide prevention, to be published later this year, will provide us with a targeted, measurable action plan for tackling this serious social problem in a coherent and integrated fashion, involving all relevant stakeholders. I assure the House that the Government will support the implementation of that action plan and will work with all concerned in achieving the desired results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, for sharing his time, thereby providing me with the opportunity to speak on the important issues of suicide prevention and mental health promotion in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I received a copy of the book <i>Echoes of Suicide. </i> It is an excellent read for anybody with an interest in the subject and gives a great insight into the different aspects of suicide and the devastating effect it has on those left behind. I acknowledge the interest in the subject of Deputy Neville, who contributed to this book. He mentioned in his article that it was in the 1990s that we discussed the matter in detail for the first time in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. There is broad agreement on the need for further development of suicide prevention initiatives and for further improvement in the delivery of our mental health services.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, suicide is a serious social problem. The report of the national task force on suicide, published in 1998, marked the completion of a detailed examination of the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide, and outlined a comprehensive strategy to reduce these in Ireland. The report outlined 86 areas where interventions should be targeted to reduce suicide levels. This highlights the complexity of the issue of suicide prevention. There are no simple solutions.</P>
      <P>Taking action to prevent suicide must involve a combination of efforts across many aspects of life, such as improving health and educational services, but also addressing issues such as social exclusion and tackling poverty and inequalities. This action must involve people from a range of <Col N="1272"/>different organisations and professions with sustained effort over a long period of time.</P>
      <P>With regard to improving health services, the task force report recommended that steps be taken to make mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly young people. Concern was expressed at the risk of suicide in older people. In this regard significant additional funding has been made available to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry and psychiatry of later life services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</P>
      <P>The level of capital funding which has been made available by the Department for the development of community based mental health facilities has increased significantly in recent years. Community services such as home nursing, day centres, family support, hostels and day hospitals will continue to be developed to make services more accessible to people who may be at risk.</P>
      <P>The prevention of illness and the promotion of healthy living is the key to improving the quality of life of all Irish people. The promotion of positive mental health is a vital part of this process. Many people try to buy their way out of the unhappiness brought on by not having enough time to spend with families and friends or doing things they enjoy. Investing in one&rsquo;s mental well-being is as important as looking after one&rsquo;s physical health.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Statistics show that the ratio of male to female suicide is approximately 3:1. However, when we look at the figures from the point of view of depression, far more women suffer from depression than men. We must bring about a major change in this area. From the point of view of depression, if men or women have something like the flu they have no difficulty in seeking medical assistance, but if they suffer from severe depression males are much more reluctant to share those feelings with people much less seek medical help. A major change must take place.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>Prevention of illness and promotion of healthy living is the key to improving the quality of life for all Irish people. They must be encouraged to invest in their mental health as much as in their physical health. In this regard, a key task of the health services is not only to treat mental illness but more importantly, using the principles of health promotion, to try and improve the mental health of the population. We are all aware of the pressures on young people such as bullying, emotional distress, addictions, peer pressure and exam pressure. We tend to think people are weak if they suffer from anxiety, depression, inability to cope, or have suicidal tendencies but it is widely acknowledged that one in four women and one in ten men will experience depression during their <Col N="1273"/>lifetime. Many are successful people, role models or celebrities whom we all know.</P>
      <P>Promotion of positive mental health will also contribute significantly to combating the ignorance and stigma that surrounds mental illness. Better understanding of mental illness encourages people to access professional help sooner rather than later and this facilitates early recovery. Eventually, with time and education, the stigma associated with mental illness may fade further away, allowing sufferers and their families to participate fully in society.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organisation&rsquo;s European section, in partnership with the European Union and the Council of Europe have adopted an action plan that will drive the policy agenda on mental health for the coming years. This action plan, signed by Ministers from 52 countries, including Ireland, sets out the commitments and responsibilities of both the WHO and Governments on this issue. It has 12 priority areas, with a strong public mental health focus, including the promotion of mental well-being, incorporation of mental health as a vital part of public health policy, reduction of stigma and discrimination, prevention of mental ill health and suicide and access to good primary health care. The national strategy for action on suicide prevention to which my ministerial colleague Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley referred earlier and the forthcoming report of the expert group on mental health policy will take full account of this plan in its recommendations.</P>
      <P>There is increasing awareness and concern among the public about good mental health. The National Health Promotion Strategy, 2000-05, in conjunction with the health strategy, Quality and Fairness - A Health System for You, views good mental health as being equally as important as physical health in the overall well-being of a person. Increasingly, good mental health is being recognised as a major challenge facing health services in the 21st century and my Department recognises the need for positive mental health promotion.</P>
      <P>Mental health promotion is a broad concept, as it emphasises promotion of the psychological health and well-being of individuals, families and communities. At national level, priority is being given to education awareness and to promoting a better understanding among the public towards mental health. The stresses and pressures associated with every day life combine in many cases with difficulties in coping with significant life events such as bereavement, unemployment and interpersonal relationship problems. Almost every family in Ireland has had or will experience mental illness. Mental illness does not just affect the sufferer it also affects the person&rsquo;s family, friends, employer and colleagues. To experience a relative, friend or employee who suffers from a mental illness can be confusing and traumatic.</P>
      <P>As my ministerial colleague, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, stated, the expert group on mental <Col N="1274"/>health policy was established in 2003 to prepare a new national policy framework for the mental health services. In the course of its work, the expert group will consider all areas of mental health policy. It will pay particular attention to the areas of mental health promotion and the importance of raising public awareness around the issues of stigma reduction and suicide prevention. The group will make recommendations on these issues when it reports later this year.</P>
      <P>As many of the activities in the area of suicide prevention relate to raising public awareness, responding to local needs and providing support in the aftermath of the occurrence of suicidal behaviour, the health services work closely with local voluntary and community groups in a number of ways. It is often the case that people are more comfortable engaging with these local groups. It is, therefore, essential that the statutory services work in partnership with the voluntary groups rather than developing competing services.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the importance of voluntary organisations in supporting and promoting positive mental health among the population. My Department is fully committed to working with voluntary groups to promote positive mental health among the public. Close links between the mental health services and voluntary organisations are of the utmost importance and every health area has a development officer who liaises between the statutory health services and the local mental health associations to provide an integrated and comprehensive service. Numerous regional initiatives also focus on mental health issues like stress management, depression, stigma reduction and suicide-related matters.</P>
      <P>My Department funds and supports in a variety of different ways the efforts of mental health organisations such as Mental Health Ireland, AWARE, Schizophrenia Ireland and GROW. I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations. Much of their work goes unnoticed. The nature of the work means it must be handled sensitively in private. Many people are giving their time voluntarily as we debate this issue to answer telephones, listen to people&rsquo;s problem and provide them with comfort. Very often, people only want a listening ear so that they can share a problem. It is important that people are prepared to give their time in an unselfish way to assist others who are less fortunate than they are.</P>
      <P>My Department also allocates funding, through the national suicide review group, for voluntary and statutory groups engaged in prevention initiatives, many of which are aimed at improving the mental health of the younger age groups. These projects include life skills courses for high risk youth, school-based personal development modules and mental health promotion campaigns. A number of these projects have been positively evaluated and have been proven to enhance the coping skills of the participants. It <Col N="1275"/>is anticipated that such campaigns will lead to a reduction in youth suicidal behaviour over time.</P>
      <P>The success and effectiveness of the policy to develop a comprehensive community-based mental health service is dependent on the active involvement of voluntary organisations concerned with the welfare of the mentally ill and those at risk of suicide and attempted suicide in the community.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to encourage in any way it can, the activities of our many voluntary organisations both at national and local level. The commitment and dedication of independent, voluntary organisations is to be commended and their input is invaluable, not only in providing support for those most vulnerable in our society, but in heightening awareness of the difficulties encountered by those suffering from mental illness, depression or feeling unable to cope with everyday life.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Government is committed to addressing the number of suicides. It is a worrying trend and we are fully committed to the further implementation of suicide prevention initiatives and the further development of our mental health services to prevent and reduce further tragic loss of life. I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I hope it will send a message to people who are feeling suicidal that suicide is not the avenue to take. While it might seem to people who are in a black hole that it is the only option open to them, unfortunately, suicide creates greater problems than it solves. Groups and organisations are willing to listen them, take their hands and lead them through the difficult time they face. There is always light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this sensitive and delicate subject. I commend the proposers for tabling the motion. The suicide epidemic is serious. The most recent statistic was that 444 people committed suicide in a year. The Ministers of State will accept that is a conservative figure and the true figure is higher. However, it is not as high as many people say. It is probably between 10% and 20% higher. Estimates have been made putting the figure at two and three times higher but that is not the case. There were 50 undetermined deaths in the same year. There are also suicides that cannot be recognised as such because of the circumstances of death. On a conservative estimate, 500 people take their lives annually. The road accident issue is important because it reflects the approach of the Government to road safety campaigns, which are under funded. A sum of &euro;22 million is provided but on average only 10% is devoted to suicide prevention, according to the Minister of State.</P><Col N="1276"/>
      <P>Every suicide affects approximately ten people and 5,000 people are deeply traumatised by suicide each year. That is not an insignificant effect on the community as in a ten-year period more than 50,000 people will be directly and deeply traumatised by suicide. However, as the Minister of State hinted, we must put the issue in context. Each community, such as Wexford, refers to difficulties such as the contagion factor and there may be a cluster and copycats in many communities. Every community will state that it is a major crisis, and while that is true, we must remember that approximately 2% to 2.5% of deaths are from suicide &mdash; out of 30,000 deaths, 500 are from suicide. We must not take the issue out of proportion, but put it in the context of total deaths. Suicide is by far the most significant cause of death of young people. It is a crisis among young males &mdash; the ratio is 8:1. It is of urgent importance that the Government invests in suicide research and prevention.</P>
      <P>I commend the President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, for her recent initiative in bringing together the organisations involved to discuss and co-ordinate their work. Most of these are non-governmental organisations. That had the effect of raising the profile of this concern and the interest of society and the media. The President has always been involved in this issue. One of the first actions she took after her election was to meet the Irish Association of Suicidology, of which I am a director, in its headquarters in Castlebar and spend several hours discussing this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke on parasuicide figures which are of extreme concern &mdash; the latest figure shows that 11,200 people presented at accident and emergency units. We do not know the figures for those who presented at their GPs or who did not present for assistance. It is conservatively felt that the true figure for attempted suicide is approximately 60,000, which is a serious issue. It is significant that among young people more girls than boys attempt suicide, as the most recent figures show that approximately 57% are female and approximately 43% are male.</P>
      <P>Urgent research into attempted suicide is necessary because, as the Minister of State rightly stated, approximately one third of people who committed suicide had previously attempted suicide. That is a significant risk factor. The work of the National Suicide Research Foundation has been commended and I also recognise it. Since it was founded by Dr. Michael Kelleher it has done excellent work and it has much expertise.</P>
      <P>Psychiatric patients are ten times more likely to take their lives than the community average. In the four weeks after discharge from a psychiatric hospital, people are between 100 and 200 times more at risk of suicide. Psychiatric services are crucial in the prevention of suicide. Some 80% to 90% of the people who take their own lives suffer from a psychiatric or emotional condition requir<Col N="1277"/>ing intervention. In young people, it is often undiagnosed depression and we must encourage, promote and educate them to recognise when they are in crisis, despair and trouble because sometimes they do not do so. They see it as failure, that life is against them or things are going wrong and they are unable to cope, but they are suffering from depression and intervention is needed.</P>
      <P>It is important that we destigmatise psychiatric illness so that parents do not tell their children who have attempted suicide not to tell anyone about it, to keep it quiet and let nobody know, as I have seen. Parents still do that because of fear of stigma. We should be more open and accepting as one in four people will suffer psychiatric illness at some stage of their lives. To destigmatise psychiatric illness is a long and difficult road, and I will return to this issue later if time permits.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the level of investment in our psychiatric services has been pointed out. In 1997, 13% of the total health budget was spent on psychiatric services and that is now down to<?oasys _jy?>6.9%. In 1960, up to 20% of the health budget was spent on psychiatric services. It was correct to reduce the numbers of people in psychiatric hospitals as many were there for social reasons, but we did not reinvest that money in community services. The figure should still be 20%, but the money should be put into community services. We do not have a community based psychiatric service and it is internationally recognised that to deal with psychiatric services in the community we need multi-disciplined psychiatric services. Investment is required to have a team of psychologists, psychotherapists, occupational therapists and other therapists in the community as a visible and immediate support to people in crisis.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned an investment of &euro;15 million in psychiatric services this year, but with all due respect &mdash; perhaps the Minister for Health and Children does not support him in such spending &mdash; that figure is derisory. It is less than what was spent on Punchestown last year. The total spent on electronic voting was &euro;60 million, and a quarter of that has been spent on developing psychiatric services. The Minister of State often quotes that approximately &euro;90 million has been spent since 1997, but that is derisory in the context of what is required. The Irish College of Psychiatry informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children that 70% of psychiatrists do not have a psychotherapist available to them and 30% do not have the support of an occupational therapist. We need investment in the professions.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State also referred to the fact that there has been some expansion in psychiatric services and in the number of psychiatrists. We need quality psychiatrists but we also need support. It is recognised that we do not have sufficient numbers in the support disciplines. Psychiatrists have stated clearly that proper <Col N="1278"/>management and a range of therapy services are required.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned that &euro;17.5 million has been spent on suicide prevention since 1998, but &euro;22 million is been spent on road accidents each year. The figure of &euro;17.5 million represents less than &euro;2 million per year. It is difficult to be critical in such a sensitive area, but how does one justify the spending of only &euro;2 million each year on suicide prevention out of a total health service budget of &euro;1 billion? We are informed that much of that &euro;2 million is being invested in the psychiatric services. It is not directly invested in suicide prevention. I put down questions on that comparing it to the year when we got &euro;600,000 &mdash; the Minister referred to &euro;2.6 million or some such figure &mdash; and the reply was to the effect that the same activities took place in every health service, that there were no new initiatives and that there was no difference in the allocation. It was just a different amount of money. Much of that money has been hived off into the general psychiatric services, and the Minister is probably aware of that.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the medical aspect but there is a danger of &ldquo;over-medicalising&rdquo; the response to the rising levels of suicide and basing all our arguments on the need for additional personnel, resources, hospital places and early intervention services. Those are vital but we miss the point about the societal influences that engender suicidal thought and actions. Leadership in identifying and addressing those societal influences is the duty of the State and, by extension, the Government. We must focus on the wider sphere. The pressure points in Irish society must be taken into account when examining the human tragedy of suicide. It is also a societal tragedy.</P>
      <P>There is merit in the argument that we must examine and debate the way the cultural and economic changes that have taken place in Ireland over the past decade may disorient people and detach them from traditional values and supports that may never have had any formal link with mental health or suicidal behaviour. Ultimately, influencing the way individuals react to changes in their social life will be central to the prevention of suicide. The changes in society have been extremely dramatic in the past two decades, and we have all lived through that. To quote George Bernard Shaw:</P>
      <P LI="1">Youth, which is forgiven everything, forgives itself nothing.</P>
      <P LI="1">Age, which is forgiven nothing, forgives itself everything.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Youths are very hard on themselves. Success is an increasingly important goal in society. In previous times the way we interacted with and supported each other was important but individual success has become important. There is a belief that anything can be achieved if we work hard and are <Col N="1279"/>smart and attractive enough but over-reliance on the individual as the arbiter of success or failure and reliance on the subjective judgment has clear implications. If I am in control of the elements that dictate success or failure, when successful the glory is mine but when there is failure it is my failure and I must take responsibility. Society no longer helps those who fail or those who perceive themselves as failures.</P>
      <P>That is evident in the era of the Celtic tiger. Perhaps there are more margins to live on than previously and the core is getting weaker. The uncertainties of life are increasing. Who we are? The core of life and being is dictated by what we can own and what we can buy. One is only as good as what one can own and the brands one wears. In a world where there are fewer certainties, young people are faced with choices that would have been unthinkable in previous generations. At the same time many of the cultural icons of the past are debased in the eyes of the young, such as the church and our own political establishment.</P>
      <P>Are adolescents more vulnerable to perceived failure today or is it just that they are less likely to ask for help? The Exploring Masculinity programme of 2000 clearly recognised that the cultural, social and psychological impacts of change demand careful attention and analysis. These are important factors in reducing suicide yet the rate has continued to increase. Are we making best use of programmes such as these? Are we supporting teachers who deal with these issues or are we losing it all in the points race and the pressure to succeed academically at all costs? In that respect I hope we will hear tomorrow from the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who have key roles to play in suicide prevention. Suicide prevention is not just a health issue, it is an educational and an environmental issue.</P>
      <P>Research, understanding and analysis of the pressures on young people are vital if we are to address the epidemic of suicide. That must not be shirked by the Minister or the Government but run parallel to the resourcing and development of these services. We must regard suicide prevention as a multi-dimensional area that requires promotion and investment.</P>
      <P>The relationship between alcohol consumption and suicidal behaviour has been well established by robust research internationally. There is a clear association between the <i>per capita </i>consumption of alcohol and the suicide rate in any country. The higher the level of consumption of alcohol, the higher the suicide rate. Alcohol consumption levels can explain the difference in suicide rates between countries and between different areas in each country.</P>
      <P>Alcohol impacts on suicide rates in a number of ways. Alcohol consumption leads to <Col N="1280"/>depression, which is a major factor in suicide and suicidal behaviour. In addition, depressed persons frequently turn to alcohol in the mistaken belief it will improve their mood. In many people alcohol has a biphacic effect, initially causing a feeling of well-being but soon to be followed by dysphoria. Traditionally, the lifetime risk for suicide in alcoholism is thought to be between 3% and 7% and the risk for major depressive illness is approximately 15%, although the latter figure is now believed to be somewhat over-estimated. The core morbidity of depression on alcohol abuse greatly increases the risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour.</P>
      <P>A third factor is that alcohol impairs judgment, reduces inhibition, increases risk-taking behaviour and may result in impulsive suicide and suicidal behaviour, most frequently in the young. Alcohol causes cognitive constriction and reduces problem-solving abilities. There is a direct relationship between the increase in alcohol consumption in Irish society and the levels of suicide. A campaign about alcoholism is very important in respect of many of the societal difficulties we are facing, including violence and so on, but alcoholism also has an impact in terms of psychiatric illness, suicide and related matters.</P>
      <P>The National Suicide Review Group was set up in 1998 following the report of the national task force on suicide. The job of the review group was to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the national task force on suicide. The Minister&rsquo;s amendment contains six of the 86 recommendations of the national task force on suicide that have been implemented. That is a fair representation of the position.</P>
      <P>Seven years after the national review group was to oversee the implementation of the recommendations, a national strategy group was set up which was to report this April. Three weeks ago, in his reply to my question on what was happening in terms of the implementation of those recommendations, the Minister said he was awaiting the report of the strategy group. There are 86 recommendations. It is extremely frustrating that we have had mental health reports and now a strategy group report, which will have to be examined and on which there will have to be consultation. When will we see action in this area?</P>
      <P>I am a director of the Irish Association of Suicidology. We have an excellent board made up of three professors of psychiatry, two consultant psychiatrists, including a former chairman of the college of psychiatry, a bereaved person, a lecturer in sociology, a counsellor for the bereaved, a member of the Samaritans and a member of the national task force on suicide. It is a diverse and very experienced 32-county group.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about his contribution to our organisation. He gave us &euro;75,000, for which we are extremely thankful. We asked the Minister of State for a meeting this year but he failed to <Col N="1281"/>meet us to ask about our level of experience and the ways we could contribute. I was reluctant to raise the matter in the House previously as we wished to progress matters otherwise, but we are very disappointed.</P>

	<P>Wednesday, 4 May 2005 will long be remembered in the Waterford constituency as a black day. It is the day on which it was announced that 485 jobs are to be lost at Waterford Crystal&rsquo;s plants in Dungarvan and Kilbarry in Waterford city. Dungarvan is to sustain the most significant hit with the proposed closure of the plant. There is deep shock in Dungarvan where the workers were briefed on the restructuring package at a meeting at 10.30 a.m. Briefing of the workforce at Kilbarry took place in the afternoon.</P>
        <P>The workers must have time to absorb fully the details of the company&rsquo;s proposals and, in conjunction with their union leaders, arrive at their response to very difficult circumstances. The response will provide the basis of talks with the company. Every effort must be made to protect the maximum number of jobs. The union is committed to advancing solidarity between the workers in Waterford city and Dungarvan. Those who above all others deserve our concern and support are the workers whose jobs are in danger and their families. They are the ones facing the abyss.</P>
        <P>The Government, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and F&Aacute;S must leave no stone unturned in seeking to minimise the number of redundancies, upskill those who become redundant and accelerate the provision of urgently required replacement jobs. Too often in the past in circumstances of closure or redundancies all the right words have been spoken by those in power on the alleviation of pain, suffering and dramatic reductions in income and quality of life for those who lose jobs, but kind words do not put food on the table or pay the bills. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must convince the House that his words are not idle, but are indicative of a deep commitment to making a difference to the lives of the victims of today&rsquo;s announcement.</P>
        <P>Dungarvan and Waterford crystal plants produce a world-class product which, over many <Col N="1282"/>years, has commanded a premium price, especially in the USA market. The company describes its task as clear and its challenge as great. The problems of people with up to 30 years service who face redundancy and their families are grave indeed. While of some assistance, words of sympathy and sadness to the workers of Waterford Crystal are no substitute for effective action. The loss of the Waterford Crystal plant is a devastating prospect for Dungarvan and west Waterford. An initial gesture of goodwill by the Government should be the immediate establishment of an advance office of Ordnance Survey Ireland in Dungarvan to ensure that full decentralisation of the agency is completed without further unnecessary delay. It is one measure which would be of significant assistance to the economy of the county town.</P>
        <P>There are many heavy hearts in Dungarvan, west, mid and east Waterford and Waterford city tonight and a very dismal future appears to face many in the constituency. F&Aacute;S and Waterford Institute of Technology have potentially significant roles to play in the upskilling and retraining of staff. The investment agencies have significant roles to play to secure investment and jobs and support existing employment. Undoubtedly, today&rsquo;s events have highlighted problems of trust in industrial relations at Waterford Crystal which are in nobody&rsquo;s long or even short-term interests. There are difficult days ahead for everyone involved, all of whom must work with the objective of ensuring that every possible job at Waterford Crystal is retained. I call on the Minister to make an absolute effort in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OllieWilkinsonFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilkinson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Shea for affording me the opportunity to say a few words on a black and dismal day for our part of west Waterford. Waterford Crystal is not alone a great Waterford industry, but has been a flagship Irish concern recognised throughout the world for the production of an amazing product. The company&rsquo;s workers were highly skilled and the industry provided tremendous employment over many years. While we have been aware for some time that all was not well in Waterford Crystal, when the news broke yesterday there was great shock that a company which had seemed invincible was in serious trouble. I can only hope the restructuring in the industry will ensure the company again becomes viable and can recover its former glory.</P>
        <P>I have no doubt the Minister and job creating agencies will respond to my request to take a serious look at Dungarvan. County Waterford is a vibrant place which has sustained a significant shock. I ask the Minister and job creating agencies to work together to ensure the great workers involved are provided with employment which compensates them for what they have lost.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues from Waterford in expressing the condolences of the Green Party to the workers of Waterford Crystal. It must be a bleak and difficult night in the town of Dungarvan, which I know well, with the future looking much more precarious and uncertain.</P>
        <P>A company operating in international markets is subject to the vagaries of international forces and there is no doubt that recent exchange rate changes have put significant pressure on Waterford Crystal. We must view this unfortunate turn of events for the company as a symbol of developments across the country over the last 15 years. It was interesting to read the Enterprise Strategy Review Group report on the performance of the Irish economy and the fantastic growth the Government has celebrated which was published last summer. While the exports of foreign direct investment companies increased dramatically, the graph depicting the exports of goods manufactured by indigenous firms had remained completely static.</P>
        <P>Since the report was published, we have seen a dramatic reversal in the fortunes of indigenous manufacturing companies. The Government and D&aacute;il should be very concerned. While we are told by economic commentators and Members on the opposite benches that all is well and that we have service industries, extensive building in a boom period and a small number of very profitable foreign companies, a balanced, stable long-term future requires indigenous companies like Waterford Crystal.</P>
        <P>Through the skilled hands of its workers, indigenous crafts and its marketing staff, Waterford Crystal was able to perform at the highest level internationally. It is noticeable that there are now very few Irish companies producing manufactured products which stand on the world stage. Waterford Crystal was one of the last and its difficulties are a sign that Irish manufacturing is in trouble. Rather than brush the matter aside and suggest we will be sustained by the service and construction industries and a small number of multinational companies, the Government should heed the warning that a flagship company is in trouble. It is a mere symbol of very significant losses of manufacturing jobs over the last 15 years, especially in recent times. I have heard nothing from the Government as to how it intends to address the problem.</P>
        <P>As well as looking for solutions in the short term or immediate locality of Waterford for the workers of Waterford Crystal, I am also concerned to hear what the Government plans to do on a broad basis across the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Eamon Ryan for sharing time. I agree with the comments of the three previous speakers. My message is one of <Col N="1284"/>solidarity with the workers in Waterford Crystal, both in Dungarvan and Waterford city. These workers have been dumped disgracefully by the management of Waterford-Wedgewood. The jobs and massive salaries of top management are to be preserved and protected, while working people with their families and communities are to be sacrificed. Previous speakers were correct in describing Waterford Crystal as a flagship industry for the south east and for Ireland, but the loss of so many jobs and the down-sizing of its operations further undermine the company and its brand.</P>
        <P>I know from workers in the factory that they regard the proposed redundancy package as totally inadequate. It was presented as a <i>fait accompli </i>and adds insult to injury. It is certainly not fair recompense for the loss of jobs and the long service by most of the workers who are being let go. I call on the management to negotiate a proper redundancy package with the work force immediately. Reported falls in sales in the US and the euro-dollar exchange rate have adversely affected the company, but workers have raised serious questions about the management of the business, including over-dependence on the US market and the purchase of ailing ceramic firms in England and Germany.</P>
        <P>Successive Governments have lionised the likes of Tony O&rsquo;Reilly, the non-executive chairman of Waterford-Wedgewood. They have fostered a corporate culture which can freely dump working people like this at will. I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to intervene, but not with yet another useless task force. The Government spawned numerous task forces in areas where jobs have been lost in the past, but most of these simply turned out to be PR exercises.</P>
        <P>The Minister should ensure, first, that a proper redundancy package is negotiated. Second, he should explore ways to preserve the skills of the workforce and to establish local enterprises or co-operatives that will keep people in employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters. The difficulties being experienced by Waterford Crystal have been well known for some time. In summary, difficulties in the marketplace combined with a weak dollar have been putting pressure on the company&rsquo;s sales targets and competitiveness. Enterprise Ireland has continued to work with the company, including a recent investment approved in 2003, which was designed to assist the company in reducing its cost base, increase home sales and maintain employment. Nevertheless, the announcement by the company of job losses of this magnitude is regrettable and my concerns are particularly for those who will lose their jobs.</P>
        <P>The overall Waterford Group has announced a restructuring programme, which, I understand, is <Col N="1285"/>designed to reduce excess capacity and overheads and improve manufacturing efficiency across the group. The group intends to restructure its business fundamentally in order to ensure its long-term future. The combined effect of these restructuring actions will be to reduce the number of people employed across the group by 1,785. This figure includes 485 at Waterford Crystal.</P>
        <P>As regards Waterford Crystal, I understand that a minimum cost reduction of &euro;25 million is required to ensure the company returns to profitability. The company has said that its current sales volume cannot sustain two viable manufacturing plants. As a result, manufacturing operations will have to be consolidated into one plant and the company has decided to close its Dungarvan plant.</P>
        <P>There is the further problem that, at present, the company is manufacturing ranges of products which are generating insufficient margins to justify the continuation of their manufacture in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I understand that the company intends to transfer 76% of the current Dungarvan output to its Kilbarry site. A total of &euro;6.8 million is to be invested in the Kilbarry site, enhancing facilities there and also improving its competitiveness. The cost base throughout the business will continue to be reduced with the planned reduction in staff levels being achieved through changes in the company&rsquo;s business model.</P>
        <P>At present, the company has 1,456 employees of which 485 will be leaving and 971 remaining. The company will be meeting with employees&rsquo; representatives over the coming days to engage in the detail of the restructuring programme. I understand that the redundancy terms on offer will be six weeks per year of service, inclusive of statutory entitlements, up to a maximum of two years&rsquo; pay.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has been in contact with the company regarding the current developments and will have a full range of supports available for redundant staff. I understand that F&Aacute;S will follow up by meeting the company at the earliest opportunity to discuss these interventions.</P>
        <P>The industrial development agencies will be making every effort to secure alternative employment for the area. I do not consider that the establishment of a task force is appropriate. The county development board is best placed to oversee and co-ordinate the industrial needs of the area, and a task force would only add another layer to this process.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for the south-east region is to promote the development of Waterford city as a gateway location with which to attract industry to the city and the region. There has also been success in attracting new knowledge-based industries with the location in Waterford of Sun Life Corporation, AOL and Genzyme. In addition, there is a strong indigenous <Col N="1286"/>presence with companies such as Dawn Meats and Radley Engineering.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has invested over &euro;9 million in indigenous enterprise in Waterford over the last three years alone. Employment in IDA Ireland supported companies in 2003 in Waterford had increased by 30.4% since 1997 and by 7.9% over the 2002 employment figures. Employment in Waterford is concentrated on the pharmaceutical, medical technology and engineering sectors, which account for 85% of employment. New projects and expansions announced by IDA Ireland client companies include Ubiqus, ABB Transformers, Biopin and AOL.</P>
        <P>As regards indigenous industry specifically, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in setting up new high potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through support of research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is continuing to work with companies in its portfolio to assist them in growing their sales and exports and to improve innovation in order that they can compete on world markets.</P>
        <P>In the last few years Irish manufacturing firms, particularly in the more traditional sectors, have operated against a backdrop of significantly declining external demand, downward price pressure, and an increasingly competitive international environment &mdash; for example, from China as well as central and eastern Europe &mdash; together with upward pressure on costs and the strengthening of the euro against our key trading partners&rsquo; currencies.</P>
        <P>Despite these pressures experienced in some manufacturing sectors, total unemployment in Ireland remains relatively low at 4.4%, down from 4.6% for the same period last year. Economic growth is forecast at 4.5% for 2005. Furthermore the projected growth rates for the United Kingdom and the United States are promising for the Irish economy as we continue to trade and also to compete successfully for high quality jobs.</P>
        <P>The sustainability of employment levels in Enterprise lreland client companies, operating in both manufacturing and internationally traded services, is heavily tied to the sustainability of their competitiveness both in terms of delivering products and services in Ireland and in export markets.</P>
        <P>The enterprise strategy group, chaired by Mr. Eoin O&rsquo;Driscoll, last year published its report Ahead of the Curve &mdash; Ireland&rsquo;s Place in the Global Economy. This provided a blueprint for the actions that need to be taken to secure and build on Ireland&rsquo;s position as a developed economy. It clearly focused on the need to accelerate the development and internationalisation of the Irish-owned business sector as a priority for future <Col N="1287"/>economic development. Following Government consideration of this report, the Minister published the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s action plan, which specifically detailed actions for implementation across a range of Departments. In particular, the Minister asked Enterprise Ireland to creatively rethink how best to help business as we deliver on the ESG recommendations.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy 2005-07. Entitled Transforming Irish Industry, the strategy is focused on implementing the recommendations of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s action plan to accelerate the development and internationalisation of Irish-owned business. The Minister also launched a new &euro;20 million productivity improvement fund for Irish industry.</P>
        <P>Announcing the new strategy, the Minister said Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s new strategy clearly represents a major change in approach. It will make a substantial contribution to the further internationalisation of Irish companies in an increasingly knowledge driven global economy. Transforming Irish industry is a significant challenge in the context of globalisation and increased competition.</P>
        <P>The reality is that Ireland is at a turning point in its economic development where the low-cost model is no longer an option. If we are to succeed, Irish companies must increasingly compete through innovation, superior market knowledge and a relentless focus on productivity gains and increased automation. In addition, to be successful, companies need to be outward looking in their development strategies and this is where Enterprise Ireland can add real value by partnering with business to harness the inherent development opportunities that global markets offer.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland has undertaken a complete business process and organisational re-engineering of its overseas and marketing supports with a clear focus on client need linked with a performance driven mission. Enterprise Ireland will be taking initiatives to underpin future performance of Irish industry making it central to industrial policy going forward.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in budget 2004, will see the transfer of 210 jobs to Dungarvan, adding a considerable economic stimulus to the town. Initial data from the central applications facility indicate that while 15 staff of Ordnance Survey Ireland have applied to decentralise to Dungarvan, there are a further 47 expressions of interest by civil servants in decentralising to the OSI in Dungarvan.</P>
        <P>As regards property acquisition, I understand from the Office of Public Works that it has chosen a site for the decentralisation project in <Col N="1288"/>Dungarvan and details of the deal are being finalised with the land owner.</P>
        <P>The overall decentralisation programme is being overseen by a decentralisation implementation group, which published a list of early movers in November last. While this list, accepted by the Government, did not include Ordnance Survey Ireland, all organisations, not just those identified as early movers, have been requested to review their individual implementation plans having regard to a range of matters including information on property, applications on the central applications facility, and previous reports of the decentralisation implementation group. In its next report the decentralisation implementation group will deal with locations and organisations not covered in its November report. I am satisfied the combined efforts of the State agencies and local business and entrepreneurs will serve to lessen the impact of the job losses and provide positive future employment opportunities for the Waterford region.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important matter regarding Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Training College, Marino. As a teacher, parent, taxpayer and Deputy for the area, I have major concerns about recent developments in the college. I express my solidarity and support for the former president of the college, Caoimhe M&aacute;irt&iacute;n, one of the top educationalists on the island and a woman of ability, professionalism and great integrity who cares passionately about education. The bottom line is that Caoimhe M&aacute;irt&iacute;n was bullied out of the college which leaves serious questions to be answered by the college governors and trustees.</P>
        <P>It saddens me to raise this issue as I care deeply about primary education. I must, however, stop the rot when an issue of this nature reaches the educational and political agenda. This is a story of bullying, intimidation and psychological abuse and of a top college of education being severely damaged by a group of people who have put the college in complete disarray.</P>
        <P>The issue also involves &euro;4.2 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money and raises the urgent need for accountability. Under the rules of the 1996 instruments of governance two separate bank accounts should have been created. Serious questions arise regarding the use of conference funds and strong evidence is available in this regard. The three core issues, therefore, are bullying and intimidation, damage to a top quality college and accountability for public funds. The staff, students and many others with an interest in education are telling the trustees and governors that an inquiry, openness and, above all, accountability are required.</P>
        <P>I also have major concerns about the role of persons from outside the education sector. I have heard complaints that a governor from Treasury <Col N="1289"/>Holdings informed others that they were sitting on 43 acres of prime real estate. I have also heard that in July 2004 the president of the college was hunched over and crying having been abused by governors. These serious issues must be tackled head on and must not be swept under the carpet. Hard questions must be answered. I cannot tolerate a top quality educationalist being abused and shafted for asking difficult questions.</P>
        <P>I thank and commend Brother Rory Geoghegan and others for speaking out about the treatment of staff at the college. He, too, suffered the consequences when he was moved to Africa. I call on the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to sort out this matter, which relates not only to a president of a college being bullied out of a job but to education, students, teachers, staff and public money. It is time for action and change.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither the Minister for Education and Science nor the Government can wash their hands of this matter. Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino receives substantial Exchequer funding, taxpayers&rsquo; money, which amounted to several million euro last year alone. The Minister has a duty to ensure this money is spent for the purpose for which it was provided, namely, primary teacher training. Serious questions have been raised in this regard and must not be left unanswered.</P>
        <P>Ongoing unhappiness with the manner in which Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino is governed culminated in the resignation of Caoimhe M&aacute;irt&iacute;n. Staff and students have been affected by the problem and some governors have gone so far as to resign. The institution, which is about to celebrate its centenary, has served our education system well. Unless the Minister takes steps to address this matter the problem can only escalate.</P>
        <P>I understand that the issue behind the recent settlement involving Ms M&aacute;irt&iacute;n related to bullying and procedures involved therein and that three other grievance procedures related to bullying behaviour by former or current members of the board of governors are progressing. I ask the Minister to give a commitment to have this matter investigated.</P>
        <P>Who will pay the costs of the recent settlement and the legal fees arising on both sides therefrom? Will the Minister of State assure the House that none of these costs will be paid through Exchequer funding which is supposed to be spent on primary teacher training? I am disappointed the Minister or either of the Ministers of State in her Department are not present to address this matter. Will the Minister of State indicate whether an external audit has ever taken place in the college? If so, when did the most recent audit take place?</P>
        <P>It is important that answers are given on this issue. Excuses which have been used about employer-employee relationships do not have a bearing on this matter, nor do they go to its heart. <Col N="1290"/>Much more is involved and I call on the Minister to ensure the matter is investigated immediately.</P>

	<P>I will respond on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who unfortunately cannot be present this evening because she is abroad on official business.</P>
        <P>As Deputies are aware, the president of Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino, Ms Caoimhe M&aacute;irt&iacute;n, resigned from her position on Friday, 29 April. It is understood the resignation relates to reported difficulties at Col&aacute;iste Mhuire in connection with the employee-employer relationship between the head of Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and her employers, the Marino Institute of Education. It is always regrettable when employee-employer difficulties cannot be resolved and an individual leaves his or her employment in such circumstances.</P>
        <P>Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and the Marino Institute of Education are privately owned entities, the college being a constituent part of the Institute of Education. As the matters surrounding the resignation concern the employee-employer relationship between the president and her employers, the role for the Department of Education and Science is limited. The Department does not have a role in employee-employer relations of this kind.</P>
        <P>Given that the circumstances surrounding the departure of Ms M&aacute;irt&iacute;n have been subject to legal proceedings, it is considered that it is not appropriate for the Department to comment on them and, accordingly, I will not make any comment on them.</P>

	<P>Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino is one of five privately owned denominational colleges of education recognised by the Department of Education and Science for the purpose of training primary teachers. The Department funds Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino on a per student basis as certified annually by the college president. It is estimated that some &euro;5 million will be allocated to the college in 2005. It is important to note that the Department is not prescriptive in how this money is spent by the college. It prescribes only that, in accordance with regulations governing all public expenditure, the moneys are spent in accordance with the purposes for which they are allocated, in this case teacher training.</P>
        <P>Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and the Froebel College of Education are funded on a per student basis. The Church of Ireland College, Rathmines and the two colleges of education for home economics, St. Catherine&rsquo;s College, Blackrock and St. Angela&rsquo;s College, Sligo, are funded on a budget basis, which involves the colleges submitting <Col N="1291"/>annual returns and financial projections for agreement by the Department.</P>
        <P>It is understood the accounts of Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and the Marino Institute of Education are audited by a private sector auditor. This is a common practice for privately owned third level institutions. As Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino receives public funding for teacher training, Deputies should also note that its annual accounts may be subjected to an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This position is similar to his role <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> many other bodies and agencies in receipt of public funds.</P>
        <P>As matters stand, there is no information to suggest that any part of the funding provided to Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino for the training of teachers was not used for that intended purpose. If anyone has any information to the contrary, it should be forwarded to the Department of Education and Science for immediate consideration and investigation, if necessary. It would be a matter of grave concern to the Minister if funding provided to Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino was not used for the training of teachers.</P>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science has confirmed that it has received some correspondence from Brother Rory Geoghegan, a Christian Brother who formerly taught in Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino. This correspondence was received last Friday, 29 April and is under consideration. I assure Deputies it is being treated as important and urgent. The correspondence raises a number of issues concerning the management and operation of Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and its relationship with Marino Institute of Education, in particular staffing matters and apparent interpersonal issues. Given the nature of the correspondence, it is not appropriate to discuss the contents of the letter. The correspondence has been passed to the trustees of Marino Institute of Education with a request that they provide their response to the issues raised by Brother Geoghegan.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The importance and urgency of the matter have been emphasised to the trustees. The issues involved internal matters concerning the relationship between Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Marino and Marino Institute of Education, a number of which relate to employee-employer relationships. As mentioned previously in regard to the president of Col&aacute;iste Mhuire, the Department of Education and Science cannot have a role in the individual employer-employee relationships of a privately owned third level institution such as Col&aacute;iste Mhuire. A similar position will also apply in the case of Brother Geoghegan, given that he has been employed in Col&aacute;iste Mhuire as an employee of Marino Institute of Education.</P>
        <P>A meeting has been scheduled for next week between officials in the Department of Education and Science and the trustees of Marino Institute of Education. At that meeting a number of <Col N="1292"/>matters relating to the resignation of Ms M&aacute;irt&iacute;n and Brother Geoghegan&rsquo;s correspondence will be discussed. At this stage I do not wish to pre-empt the discussions between the Department and the Marino Institute of Education trustees by dwelling on the matter any further but I assure the Deputies that the Minister for Education and Science is well aware of the concerns in regard to the resignation of Ms Caoimhe M&aacute;irt&iacute;n, president of the college, and the issues surrounding the resignations are being treated as urgent. The Minister will be better informed after the meeting next week and able to comment further.</P>

      <sTitle>Anti-Social Behaviour Project.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
	<P>During the mid 1990s Dundee City Council experienced problems with nuisance neighbours and anti-social behaviour. The policy of eviction was deemed unworkable as it became clear that this approach was not solving the problem. In cases that resulted in an eviction, little was done to tackle the causes of the problem. Accommodation was not available to those who had been evicted from council properties and many families ended up in bed and breakfast accommodation, temporary housing or living with relatives. The problem was displaced rather than addressed.</P>
        <P>In an attempt to tackle the underlying problems of nuisance neighbours and to seek long-term solutions, Dundee City Council asked the children&rsquo;s charity NCH to manage and develop a project. In 1996, it established the Dundee Families Project. This offered a wide range of support services to the homeless or those facing eviction as a result of anti-social behaviour. Between 1996 and 2000, 126 families were referred to the project.</P>
        <P>The aim of the Dundee Families Project is to work with those families facing eviction and to restore families to satisfactory tenancy arrangements through appropriate and intensive support. The project offers a wide range of services for families including parenting skills, anger management courses, cookery classes, domestic budgeting and acts as a link to other services such as drug treatment and health services. Many of the families referred to this project have a history of anti-social behaviour, such as noise pollution, violence, damage to property, drug dealing, fire raising and running a protection racket while other referrals are related to family relationship problems.</P>
        <P>The project offers three main support services to families. Outreach work and early intervention is undertaken to avoid evictions. Project staff work with families either at their home or at the project centre to address the cause of anti-social behaviour. Residential core accommodation is aimed at meeting the needs of those facing eviction. The project can provide for three families to reside at a residential unit and they are offered intensive support on a 24 hour basis. Alcohol and <Col N="1293"/>drug counselling is arranged for those who would benefit from it. Most families using this service stay in the residential unit for approximately nine months. The project also has 12 flats throughout Dundee offering reduced family support. Many families who have used residential core accommodation move into these flats. Once they have been shown that they can successfully live in the community, the tenancy of the accommodation is transferred to them.</P>
        <P>There has been a marked reduction in anti-social behaviour and evictions in Dundee. Half of the referrals came from housing and social services and approximately two thirds of the cases were considered successful and these families were rehoused. One fifth of cases did not meet the expected targets and one tenth of families refused to engage with the project.</P>
        <P>Many of the families who used the Dundee project are considered vulnerable. Research undertaken by the University of Glasgow in 2002 evaluating the project revealed that families involved had a long history of anti-social behaviour. Approximately two thirds of households had a one parent family structure and the average family size was 3.4 children. Nearly all families were poor and reliant on state benefits. Drug or alcohol problems affected 70% of adults, 50% of whom had criminal records. There was evidence of neglect affecting almost half the children and more than half of the women had experienced domestic violence.</P>
        <P>It is widely believed that schemes like the Dundee Families Project are costly. This project, however, has been evaluated as cost effective. An assessment by the University of Glasgow estimated that it saved £117,600 per year for Dundee City Council. The council made savings as a result of the decrease in tenant evictions and because fewer children needed to be taken into care.</P>
        <P>Evicting families from their homes does little to address the root causes of anti-social behaviour. The Dundee project offers an innovative, effective approach that reduces anti-social behaviour through tailored support and assistance. Evidence from the project found that many families causing anti-social behaviour had problems with alcohol or drug abuse and that children and women had experienced domestic violence. This further emphasises the need to ensure that adequate help and treatment is available to address these problems. The Dundee Families Project has proved successful in reducing anti-social behaviour and giving vulnerable families the necessary advice and support they need.</P>
        <P>The local authority in Aberdeen has embraced this project, as have local authorities in Manchester on a pilot basis. To consider its potential in Ireland, we would have to establish it on a pilot basis but, at a minimum, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should examine in depth the lessons to be gleaned <Col N="1294"/>from the Dundee experience and see if they could be applied in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to address the question of anti-social behaviour in the context of the management of local authority housing.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock, including addressing any problems arising on their housing estates from serious anti-social behaviour. In recent years a number of measures have been put in place to ensure that local authorities have sufficient capacity to fulfil these responsibilities. New legislative provisions have been enacted, including the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 and the recently enacted Residential Tenancies Act 2004. These Acts provide local authorities with specific powers to deal with anti-social behaviour within local authority, voluntary and private estates.</P>
        <P>Outside of the legislation, various other initiatives have also been taken to promote improved estate management. These include the housing management grants scheme, the promotion of best practice in housing management in line with the recommendations of the housing management group, a programme of tenant training and development, and the estate improvement programme to assist in tackling environmental and related problems in severely run-down local authority housing estates and flat complexes in certain disadvantaged urban areas. The housing management initiatives grants scheme established in the mid 1990s, assists local authorities and voluntary organisations to undertake practical pilot projects to improve their housing management. To date, funding of almost &euro;6 million has been provided in grants to improve management of the public and social housing sector. Under the scheme the Department has grant-aided many initiatives including staff and tenant training in estate management, the recruitment of tenant liaison officers and other estate-based staff.</P>
        <P>A further initiative to support local authorities to improve housing management was the launch of the housing unit. Its purpose is to assist local authorities to develop a more effective operational approach to housing management. The unit has produced guidance for local authorities in preventing and combating anti-social behaviour and organising training courses.</P>
        <P>The Dundee families project was introduced in 1997 and is an interesting initiative. It has directly addressed the destructive behaviour of families at risk or under threat of eviction with the aim of trying to change their behaviour. More than 80 families have been helped in a joint project including a voluntary group and the local authority. While the precise form of this project may fall outside of the scope of the existing housing <Col N="1295"/>support schemes for which the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible, I will continue to encourage the active co-operation between local authorities and the voluntary sector. I will follow the progress of the Dundee project to see what lessons relevant to our circumstances can be learned. While it may <Col N="1296"/>not be appropriate to our schemes, I am sure some aspects of it can be examined. I will undertake to have the matter examined in more detail. I thank Deputy Kirk for bringing the Dundee project to my attention.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council was established in 2000 under the aegis of my Department to promote the fullest practical co-operation between the State agencies involved in the food industry, in the interests of the optimum development of the industry. The council has an independent chairman, Mr. Padraic White.</P>
        <P>The inaugural meeting of the council took place in March 2000 and it has met on 20 occasions since its inception. The council did not meet in 2004 as a number of factors contributed to the difficulties in re-scheduling meetings that year. My Department is currently drawing up an outline work programme for discussion with the council&rsquo;s chairman, having regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the recommendations of the enterprise strategy report, the 2015 agri-vision report and work on the national strategic implementation plan to achieve the goals set out in the Government&rsquo;s research and development action plan, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Knowledge Economy.</P>
        <P>The council has played a significant role in increasing co-operation, at formal and informal level, between the State agencies involved in the food industry and has led to a number of memorandums of understandings being agreed between agencies. The council has also produced a number of publications, which have been well received by the industry. In 2001, the council was instrumental in the drawing up of an agreed human resource development programme for the food processing industry and also produced the publication, Market Trends &mdash; Implications for Suppliers and State Agency Initiatives. In December 2002, the council&rsquo;s publication, A National Food Incident Management Plan, was launched. The market led new product development guide, launched in April 2003, provides guidance to food and drink companies in relation to new product development best practice and this has since been promulgated to county enterprise boards.</P><Col N="1298"/>
        <P>During 2004 the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 met twice with my Department to assess progress on the plan in preparation for meetings of the monitoring committee for the programmes concerned.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Hogan</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>her plans for cross-compliance under the single farm payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[13993/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the new single payment scheme farmers receiving direct aid are required to respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health, and welfare, and plant health and to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC. There will also be an obligation on the member state to ensure that there is no significant reduction in the amount of land under permanent pasture by reference to the total area under permanent pasture in 2003. These requirements are termed cross-compliance.</P>
        <P>The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross-compliance are in place for many years now. Producers are generally familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland. The Department prepared a consultative document on cross-compliance in October 2004 and invited views from interested organisations. Department officials met the main farming organisations in December to discuss their submissions and these discussions have continued more recently in the context of the review of the protocol on direct payments.</P>
        <P>An information booklet on cross-compliance has been issued to all farmers and it sets out the principle features of cross-compliance both in terms of the standards that must be met by farmers and the control arrangements that will be necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of countrywide farmer information meetings organised by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc took place in early April. These meetings focused not only on cross-compliance but also addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>In implementing the single payment scheme, I am aiming to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross-compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 or so inspections, which were carried under the old regime, will be significantly reduced to some 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers. However, in certain instances more than one inspection of a holding may be unavoidable.</P>

	<P>I remain very concerned about the level of safety on our farms and I support wholeheartedly the Programme of Work 2005 of the Health and Safety Authority which is the State authority charged with overall responsibility for promotion and enforcement of workplace health and safety.</P>
        <P>The authority has a proactive inspection and enforcement programme which focuses on high risk sectors, including agriculture, and aims to achieve an improvement in farm safety, and an increase in the percentage of farms with safety statements.</P>
        <P>To achieve these objectives actions are being taken to: focus initiatives on changing farmer behaviour as it relates to farm safety, inspect farms, agricultural suppliers and agricultural contractors and address the issues of safety statements, farm self-assessments, machine operation with a particular emphasis on tractor use, slurry handling, livestock handling, electrical installations, and child safety; review the code of practice on preventing accidents to children in agriculture; encourage, promote and implement the approach outlined in the farm safety action plan 2003-07; and undertake innovative approaches with other interested parties in the agricultural sector to promote farm safety.</P>
        <P>While I welcome and support the efforts of the Health and Safety Authority, it is clear to me that the primary responsibility for safety on the farm rests personally with each and every farmer and it is ultimately only at farm level that the actions can be taken which will avoid injuries and deaths in the future.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 61 and 100 together.</P>
        <P>I visited the United States over the period 9 to 16 April. This was my first visit to the US as Mini<Col N="1300"/>ster for Agriculture and Food and had as its overall objective the consolidation and further development of political, investment and trade links between Ireland and the US in the sphere of agriculture, with particular emphasis on food, nutrition and research and development.</P>
        <P>My itinerary encompassed visits to New York, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Washington DC and Chicago, Illinois, in the course of which I had meetings with Mr. Mike Johanns, the US Agriculture Secretary and with a number of American and Irish owned US based companies. I also met the senior executives in the US of both Bord Bia and the Irish Dairy Board.</P>
        <P>My meeting with Secretary Johanns covered a number of issues of mutual concern, most notably the recent developments in agricultural policy in both the EU and US and their relevance to the ongoing World Trade Organisation negotiations. I took the opportunity to outline Ireland&rsquo;s particular perspective on the agriculture dimension to WTO. I furthermore explained the recent CAP reforms and the overall policy approach being pursued in the CAP, especially following the MTR, and their impact on the EU&rsquo;s negotiating position in the WTO. As well as considering the up to date position in the negotiations, Secretary Johanns and I discussed the prospects for a conclusion to the talks and how other current policy issues, in the EU and the US, might influence the outcome. I also brought to his attention a number of concerns on bilateral trade issues. Our discussions also covered the significance of both US investment in Ireland in the areas of food and nutrition and ongoing investment by Irish agri-food companies in food-related businesses in the US. My meeting with Secretary Johanns was a very worthwhile and timely exchange of views and perspectives.</P>
        <P>On the business development dimension of the visit, a key objective was to promote and further develop investment and technology links between Irish food companies and leading US food corporations, particularly in the areas of research collaboration and new high growth food sectors such as functional foods and ingredients and the health and well-being sectors. A number of key investment initiatives have already arisen out of the visit. I am not in a position to divulge the details at this point because of the necessity to respect commercial confidentiality.</P>
        <P>On 28 April I was, however, able to announce one very welcome development arising from the visit. This was an exclusive research, development and cross-licensing agreement entered into by Cork company, Alimentary Health, with the major US company, Mead Johnson Nutritionals. Under the terms of this agreement, Alimentary Health and Mead Johnson Nutritionals will each contribute their intellectual property and patented technologies to research projects and jointly fund development programs focussing on the development of new paediatric nutritional products.</P><Col N="1301"/>
        <P>I am satisfied that the visit met its overall objective and that appropriate follow up will be undertaken by Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The potato industry makes an important contribution to the rural and national economy. The farm gate value of the sector is estimated at &euro;85 million in 2004 which represents a fall on the previous year due mainly to lower prices and a reduction in fresh potato consumption. Since taking up office in the Department of Agriculture and Food, I have become very conscious of the need to bring the sector to a higher plane and maximise the contribution and value of this traditional industry to the economy.</P>
        <P>In 2004, my Department completed an expenditure review report of State programmes in the sector. What was very clear from the report was the need to further develop seed potato production and bring commercial focus to this area of activity. Following a series of meetings with representative bodies, State organisations and others I have put in place measures aimed at revitalising this key area. Charges are being introduced for the first time this year for seed certification. The growing of pre-basic seed, heretofore carried out by the Department, will in future be carried out by growers themselves. These measures will assist in the development of a specialised seed sector and allow market forces operate. The need for close marketing linkages between seed and ware growers is essential and this new framework will assist in this process.</P>
        <P>I am also introducing measures which will further protect the high plant health status of Irish potatoes and prevent the entry of such quarantine diseases as ring rot and brown rot which could have a devastating effect on the industry. Accordingly, I will sign a statutory instrument next week which will make it obligatory on all importers of potatoes for planting to notify the Department five days in advance of such importations.</P>
        <P>Since last December I have approved grant aid of more than &euro;6.3 million to 17 potato projects for the modernisation and development of new facilities under the Department&rsquo;s marketing and processing scheme. This brings to some &euro;10 million the total grant aid provided to potato growers and packers under the current NDP programme. The modern infrastructures which are now being put in place will ensure all year round availability of quality potatoes, the development of value added products and the minimisation of the need for imports. I am also considering the provision of grant assistance to producers who are prepared to modernise and invest in facilities necessary for high quality seed production, partic<Col N="1302"/>ularly for early generation material. These measures will ensure the development of a competitive potato sector in Ireland.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is obviously referring to a draft document prepared by the Commission for a meeting of the college of Commissioners, held last March, to review the current state of the European GMO legislative framework. It should be noted that following that meeting, the Commission confirmed its full confidence in the existing regulatory system and did not consider it necessary to call on the governments of member states to take on any additional responsibility.</P>
        <P>Over the past six years or so, a comprehensive suite of legislation governing the deliberate release, the authorisation and the labelling and traceability of genetically modified products has been put in place. This was done to ensure that the highest standards of protection operate to safeguard the health and environmental welfare of the citizens of the Community. That legislation was adopted under the co-decision procedure, which implies that each individual piece of legislation secured the agreement of both the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The legislation is binding on all member states.</P>
        <P>The position of the Government on genetically modified organisms, which was informed by the report of the interdepartmental group on modern biotechnology published by the Government Stationery Office in October 2000 is positive but precautionary. This takes account of the undoubted potential that biotechnology offers in the fields of medicine, health, agriculture, etc., while at the same time recognising that caution must be exercised to ensure that food safety and the environment are protected. This position is fully consistent with the EU legislation currently in place.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 78 together.</P>
        <P>Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. My Department is represented on the bioenergy strategy group established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources to consider policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the proportion of energy from biomass in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. My Department is represented on that group. As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, in December 2004. This report provides comprehensive details on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market.</P>
        <P>The possibility of producing bioethanol from sugar beet was mooted recently in the context of the closure of the Carlow sugar factory but Irish Sugar Limited has indicated that it intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. Arrangements are being made to transport the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to Mallow.</P>
        <P>Under the single payment scheme operated by my Department aid is available at a rate of &euro;45 per hectare per year for areas sown with energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on his holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of products considered to be biofuels and for electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.</P>
        <P>A maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for which aid for energy crops can be granted has been established in the European Union. According to figures provided by the EU Commission, in excess of 303,000 hectares was sown with energy crops in 2004, of which 439 hectares were Irish. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing crops for energy purposes, and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme. I am having the energy crops scheme and a number of other areas such as wood biomass considered by <Col N="1304"/>my Department to determine how their bioenergy potential can be promoted.</P>

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to recent concerns expressed, following the release of film by Compassion in World Farming, of the conditions under which some live cattle are exported from this country for slaughter abroad; the steps in place to ensure that such animals are treated humanely; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I am aware of the recent film produced by Compassion in World Farming, CIWF, and the issues raised therein. However, I should point out that this film did not actually show any ill treatment of Irish cattle during their transportation to the Lebanon.</P>
        <P>The live export trade is important to the livestock sector here, as it provides an important outlet for categories of cattle thereby helping to sustain prices for the very many farm families in Ireland who rely on beef production for their livelihoods. I recognise that this trade must be based on high standards and that it is essential that the welfare of animals transported from Ireland should be a priority. To safeguard the welfare of cattle during transport, my Department has in place a comprehensive legislative framework to ensure that vessels authorised for the carriage of livestock by sea are designed and fitted out in a manner which ensures the welfare of the animals and has rigorous controls and procedures in place to ensure compliance with this welfare legislation. My Department will fully investigate alleged breaches of welfare requirements that are brought to its attention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries.</P>
        <P>Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the FVO, food and veterinary office, of the EU.</P><Col N="1305"/>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. To be approved as an exporter to the EU, a third country must: appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law; and have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have: standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; traceability-labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Importers of animal products must be registered with my Department. They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years.</P>
        <P>Imported animal products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production and, in the case of meat and meat extracts imported from third countries, a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.</P>
        <P>While there is free movement for trade within the EU, all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into <Col N="1306"/>Europe, provided under the harmonised legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the Community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on animal health and the food chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health.</P>
        <P>Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from EU countries or regions of countries may also be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU.</P>

	<P>The level of funding available to each member state under the single payment scheme has already been agreed under European Council Regulation 1782/2003. The amount available to Ireland in 2005, including the dairy premium, is &euro;1.260 billion and this will increase to &euro;1.322 billion as and from 2006 onwards. The envelope of money available to each member state represents the average value of livestock premia and arable aid paid in the respective member state during the three year reference period 2000 to 2002 calculated at the 2002 rates of payment. Also included in the envelope is the new dairy premium introduced for the first time in 2004, the value of which will increase to some &euro;186 million by 2006.</P>
        <P>Increasing or index linking the level of aid available to each member state was not an element of the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as degression, to meet future financing needs. One of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal. The removal of this particular provision meant a saving of some &euro;420 million for Ireland over the <Col N="1307"/>lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.</P>

	<P>In recent years, my Department has made <i>ex gratia</i> payments to a number of organisations directly involved in the delivery of animal care and welfare services to help towards their work. The amounts paid by my Department are as follows. In 2001, &euro;650,741 was allocated to 52 organisations, in 2002, &euro;500,000 was allocated to 67 organisations, in 2003, &euro;850,000 was allocated to 80 organisations and in 2004, &euro;1 million was allocated to 83 organisations.</P>
        <P>I am very pleased to be in a position to be able to help these largely voluntary organisations which do so much good work throughout the country in delivering animal care and welfare services. The assistance provided has made a real difference to the bodies concerned in sustaining their efforts over the years. I recognise that such funding will never be enough to defray the full costs to these bodies of meeting all the demands made on them and that they will continue to need the support of the public if they are to maintain their operations at effective levels.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The CSO 1999-2000 household budget survey indicates that approximately 60% of farm household income comes from off-farm sources. This indicates that many farm families do not solely rely on farm income for their livelihood and off-farm employment has become increasingly common for farm families. Interestingly, much of this off-farm employment is related to agriculture and the agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>Analysis conducted for the agri-vision 2015 committee show that of the 136,000 farms in 2002, 38,700 farms were classified as being economically viable with 19,000 of viable farms being part-time farms that is with the farmer and-or spouse having an off-farm income, 37,000 were classed as non-viable farms and 60,000 as transitional.</P>
        <P>If the current trends were to continue to 2015 there would be approximately 105,000 farms with <Col N="1308"/>approximately 30,000 viable farms of which 20,000 would be part-time, 37,000 non-viable farms and 38,000 transitional farms.</P>
        <P>However, when the impact of decoupling, demographics and macro-economic trends are taken into consideration, the composition of the 105,000 farms projected for 2015 alters with a greater number of viable farms projected. The analysis estimated that there would be 40,000 viable farms of which 31,500 would be part-time, 45,000 non-viable farms and 20,000 transitional farms.</P>
        <P>These results show that the policy changes, in particular decoupling, would enable larger numbers of farmers to remain viable, but there would also be an increase in the number of part-time farmers. The 2015 committee emphasised that the changes in farm numbers are based on expected reactions of many thousands of farm families to changes in the policy and economic environment, and that they do not, in any sense, constitute a prescription.</P>

The detailed implementation of this framework is the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level and is likely to conclude at the WTO ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy and represents a satisfactory outcome from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view. My priorities for the further negotiations are to ensure that: the phasing out of all forms of export subsidies will be applied in parallel, as provided for under the framework agreement, and that the phasing-out period will be as long as possible; and Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market as a result of the level of tariff protection that will apply on imports from third countries. My overriding objective will be to ensure that the terms of a new agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>

	<P>I advise the Deputy that there were two separate incidents in the four week period from 18 October to 11 November 2004, in which traces of terrestrial animal bone were found in samples of imported feed material. The affected feed material and associated compound feed was subsequently impounded, recalled, where necessary, and detained by my Department.</P>
        <P>The first incident refers to two consignments of sugar beet pulp, totalling around 4,160 tonnes, which were imported into Dundalk port from Germany, via Holland, on 18 and 22 of October 2004. Testing carried out by the competent authorities in other member states discovered similar problems with imports of this material. Officials in my Department examined and accepted a proposal submitted by the importer to dispose of the contaminated material and associated compound feed. In March of this year, the contaminated sugar beet pulp material was despatched under the supervision of Department officials to Holland for destruction by means of incineration at a power generation plant in that country. The dispatch of the associated compound feedingstuffs to Holland is scheduled to happen in the next couple of weeks, and again it will be under the supervision of officials of my Department.</P>
        <P>The second incident refers to a consignment of maize gluten, totalling around 6,515 tonnes, imported from the USA and part discharged at Foynes on 9 November and part in Ringaskiddy on 11 November. The original feed material and the associated compound feed has been recalled and is currently held in a number of secure stores. The importer in this case sought a judicial review in the High Court of the powers used to issue the instructions to impound and recall the affected material. The judge ruled in favour of the importer. However, on the advice of senior counsel and considering the implications of the ruling for the current EU controls on processed animal proteins, my Department has lodged an appeal of the judgment with the Supreme Court and will ask its counsel to prepare papers which will I hope result in a reference being made to the European Court of Justice on the interpretation of EU legislation and its effect.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, and without prejudice to liability the importer has submitted a proposal to my Department for disposal of the contaminated material, which involves the export of the material for incineration at a power generation plant. Officials of my Department have examined and accepted the proposal and it is anticipated that the export of the material will be carried out shortly under strict supervision.</P>

	<P>My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it has proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision has been made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>As participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming had retired before the start of the reference period in 2000, they are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, a concession agreed with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming.</P>
        <P>Participants in the current early retirement scheme, who would have farmed during part or all of the reference period, can activate entitlements and lease them to their existing transferee. If the transferee does not want the entitlements, the transferor &mdash; retired farmer &mdash; has until 2007 within which to lease or transfer the entitlements, with land, to another farmer. My Department has recently written to these retired farmers advising them on how to activate entitlements.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 105 together.</P>
        <P>The Health and Safety Authority is the State authority charged with overall responsibility for promotion and enforcement of workplace health and safety. The authority has a proactive inspection and enforcement programme, Programme of Work 2005, which focuses on high risk sectors, including agriculture, and aims to achieve an improvement in farm safety, and an increase in the percentage of farms with safety statements.</P>
        <P>In launching the farm safety week last month, I noted that the trend of death and injuries of children on our farms is, thankfully, falling due to key initiatives taken by the Health and Safety Authority in the recent past. The four key themes for farm safety week were: safety for the elderly on farms; completion of the farm safety self-assessment document; tractor maintenance; and machine guarding, especially power take off, PTO, shafts.</P>
        <P>However, it is clear to me that the primary responsibility for safety on the farm rests personally with each and every farmer and it is ultimately only at farm level that the actions can be taken which will avoid injuries and deaths in the future.</P>

	<P>Since the introduction of milk pro<Col N="1312"/>duction partnerships, MPPs, in 2002 the regulations have been reviewed regularly to ensure the balance between the special treatment afforded to partnerships and the restrictions on their formation is appropriate to the circumstances of the sector. I am satisfied this objective has been met.</P>
        <P>While the number of standard MPPs is still quite low, I am satisfied the partnership format will make a very significant contribution to the sector by allowing dairy farmers operate at a viable level and to have a satisfactory balance between work and family life.</P>
        <P>There are now 250 new entrant-parent MPPs operating and this format is giving young trained farmers a worthwhile stake in the family enterprise. This will enhance the prospects of their continuing on with a career in dairying in the longer term which is vital to the whole industry.</P>
        <P>In regard to 2005, I have increased the off-farm income limits for both standard and new entrant-parent MPPs and have streamlined the application process by removing the pre-partnership land transfer rule and easing the pre-partnership production rule. In this year&rsquo;s milk quota restructuring scheme, I changed the quota access conditions for new entrant-parent MPPs. Now all but the largest producers will be able to form such partnerships with an eligible son or daughter but the new entrant ceases to have priority access to quota when the combined quota of the parent and new entrant reaches 500,000 litres. This will make the system fairer and further enhance the impressive contribution that the new entrant-parent format has made to the sector. I will continue to examine the partnership model and explore further options for its development to ensure that the format is used to the maximum advantage of the dairy sector.</P>

	<P>The most recent figures available from the CSO show that there were 77,900 full-time farmers, as defined by the CSO, in 2003 a drop of 20,400 since 1997. Over the same period the number of part-time farmers increased by 7,900 to 57,200. The agri-vision 2015 committee indicated in its report that it believed the trend to part-time farming using a somewhat different definition than the CSO will continue.</P>
        <P>The ongoing trend towards part-time farming reflects a combination of factors, including the increased availability of off-farm employment. <Col N="1313"/>Many smaller farmers are finding that combining farming with off-farm employment is an effective way to ensure their viability on the land. At the same time, full-time farmers are looking to the new flexibility offered to them under decoupling to develop and intensify their commercial farm enterprises.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 89 together.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has an ongoing programme of research investigating the potential risks and benefits associated with the growing of GM crops in Ireland including, <i>inter alia</i>, the economic implications. Preliminary research completed by it to date indicates that the cultivation of certain crops with certain modifications may provide a financial incentive to the individual Irish farmer. While strands of this research parallel recently completed work in other countries, it does not specifically address the costs associated with the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops. The general conclusion of recent Danish and UK research on the economic impact of co-existence on farm profitability is that the costs of complying with the required thresholds for crops of maize, potatoes, cereals, oilseed rape and sugar beet vary from zero to 9% above the costs of growing conventional crops. However, it should be noted that costs described were based on estimates.</P>
        <P>To establish greater clarity in the matter, as far as Irish conditions are concerned, I have asked Teagasc to explore the possibility of carrying out an evaluation of the possible national economic implications for the agri-food industry from the possible use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. Teagasc has now set up an internal working group of economists, agronomists and animal scientists to address this question in more detail and it plans to publish the results of the analysis in due course.</P>
        <P>In regard to tracing a consignment, EU legislation, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in 2003, requires that all GM products have to be properly labelled and be accompanied by the appropriate documentation to facilitate full traceability.</P>

	<P>Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. My Department is represented on the bioenergy strategy group established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources to consider policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the proportion of energy from biomass in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. My Department is represented on that group. As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, in December 2004. This report provides comprehensive details on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market.</P>
        <P>The possibility of producing bioethanol from sugar beet was mooted recently in the context of the closure of the Carlow sugar factory but Irish Sugar Limited has indicated that it intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. Arrangements are being made to transport the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to Mallow.</P>
        <P>Under the single payment scheme operated by my Department aid is available at a rate of &euro;45 per hectare per year for areas sown with energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on his holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of products considered to be biofuels and for electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.</P>
        <P>A maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for which aid for energy crops can be granted has been established in the European Union. According to figures provided by the EU Commission, in excess of 303,000 hectares was <Col N="1315"/>sown with energy crops in 2004, of which 439 hectares were Irish. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme. I am having the energy crops scheme and a number of other areas such as wood biomass considered by my Department to determine how their bioenergy potential can be promoted.</P>

	<P>Implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In October last, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December, the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or with the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which had been delivered in March, 2004.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April. I understand that a revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, will be sent to the Commission very shortly. Ireland has already submitted proposals for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive, designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 121 together.</P>
        <P>Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet nor is there a quota at farm level. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Limited, which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Limited places annual contracts with farmers to grow a specified tonnage of sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.</P>
        <P>The question of ownership of the sugar quota has never been an issue in the past because the EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. However, the status of the quota has become the subject of debate since the Commission raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility in the context of the proposed reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, are strongly opposed to the idea of quota mobility but if it is maintained in the Commission&rsquo;s legislative proposals, due to be published around June, then the Commission will propose appropriate rules to deal with the new situation. I have sought the advice of the Attorney General in that context but my objective will be to ensure that the status quo is maintained and that cross-border mobility of quota is not allowed.</P>
        <P>The decision by Greencore to close its plant in Carlow and to consolidate all of its sugar manufacturing in Mallow was a commercial decision taken by the board on 12 January 2005. The company advised my Department two days in advance of the board meeting that a proposal concerning the future of its two processing plants and involving the likely closure of the Carlow plant would be put to the board for decision.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has consistently supported the live export trade as an essential market outlet for Irish farmers. My Department&rsquo;s function in the transport of animals by sea is to approve vessels for the carriage of livestock by working closely with applicant companies to ensure that the conditions aboard such vessels are consistent with national and EU animal welfare requirements. Within this framework, 18 dedicated livestock vessels and three roll on roll off vessels have been approved for the carriage of <Col N="1317"/>cattle since 1995. The actual provision of such services is a commercial matter.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that, following the ending of the P&amp;O service in December 2004, the live cattle export trade to continental Europe resumed in February 2005 on the ferry service between Rosslare and Cherbourg. The number of cattle exported live from Ireland in 2005 up to the beginning of April, is 43,243, compared with 25,452 in the same period of 2004.</P>
        <P>Exports of live cattle to third country markets take place with the aid of EU export refunds. As recently as last week, I opposed the position taken by some EU member states at the Agriculture Council with regard to eliminating such refunds. I remain committed to the continuation of a viable live export trade. This requires the retention of export subsidies for the time being. In the case of all exports of live animals, the implementation of appropriate welfare safeguards is an essential requirement.</P>

	<P>The agreement on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 26 June 2003 provided a financial envelope to each member state. This envelope represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three year reference period 2000-02 calculated at 2002 rates of payment. The outcome of the agreement, which will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society and more defensible in a WTO context, was a balanced one which addressed Ireland&rsquo;s principal objectives. Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.</P>
        <P>Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as degression, to meet future financing needs. One of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal. The removal of this particular provision meant a saving of some &euro;420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review, from 2007 onwards, the financial situation annually if budget deficits arise.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to payments under the single payment scheme is that the European Council Regulation 1782/2003 governing the <Col N="1320"/>scheme stipulates that payments shall be made once a year within the period from 1 December of the year of application to 30 June of the following year. The regulation also provides for the payment of advances in circumstances to be decided by the EU Commission subject to the budgetary situation.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible for any member state to decide on different payment dates to those specified in the European Council regulation or to those which, may be specified by the EU Commission if certain circumstances arise. Since the rules governing the single payment scheme are prescribed under European Council and Commission regulations, my Department has no option but to adhere to them.</P>

	<P>The food institutional research measure, FIRM, is a public good research programme in the food sector. The main objectives of the programme are to provide a base of information and expertise in generic technologies that supports innovation and product development in the food industry, and assists in assuring consumer protection by ensuring that product development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality issues. The research is carried out at suitable institutions that can demonstrate the necessary research capabilities, including universities, institutes of technology and Teagasc food centres.</P>
        <P>The areas targeted under the programme include: development of technologies to build a more competitive, innovative, consumer-focused and sustainable food production and marketing sector; development of the scientific knowledge to underpin effective food safety practices at all stages in the food chain; consumer foods technology; innovation in functional foods; cheese diversification; production of new food ingredients; nutrition; and new technologies for added-value meat products.</P>
        <P>The FIRM programme has contributed to the formation of recognised centres of excellence in food research in Ireland. A number of research teams have been created at the various institutions and the capability and critical mass that has been developed, together with the associated knowledge base, represents a major resource for industry. In addition, the public good food research programmes have been instrumental in the development of a number of food products which contribute to the health and nutritional intake of the consumer. The outcomes of the <Col N="1321"/>research are disseminated widely for the benefit of the industry as a whole.</P>
        <P>Progress under the measure has been very satisfactory with 110 projects awarded funding following general calls in 2000 and 2004 and a tar<Col N="1322"/>geted call in 2001. A further targeted call issued at the end of March 2005 inviting proposals under the food safety and beverages themes.</P>

        <P>A settlement was reached with the plaintiff on 6 December 2004. The settlement was agreed on the basis of legal advice from State Counsel and with the sanction of the office of the Attorney General. It was without admission of liability by the defendants.

        <P>Bord Bia will shortly commission a promotion of new season lamb on the Irish market, which will be extended over the months of May and June. It will also undertake a campaign on the French market over the coming months, aimed at maintaining and increasing market share for Irish lamb there. Initiatives such as these play an important role in maintaining and developing markets at home and abroad for Irish lamb. Whereas my Department is concerned that farmers receive a fair price for their produce, it has no function in the determination of market prices.</P>

	<P>The farmers markets concept has experienced significant growth in recent years with more than 80 separate markets operating under various arrangements in 22 locations throughout the country. My Department recognises the potential of farmers markets and actively supports efforts to promote the concept on a sustainable basis.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia, which operates under the aegis of my Department, has launched a number of initiatives in this area. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, the board recently launched A Guide to Farmers Markets in Ireland. The guide identifies <Col N="1323"/>the benefits of farmers markets for producers, consumers and local economies, lists the location of markets and trading days and offers clear advice on what makes for a successful farmers market. Bord Bia also provides general advice and information to people who have an active interest in setting up farmers markets. Further scope for developing farmer markets has been identified in the speciality-artisan food sector and Bord Bia is working with small food producers to develop this route to market.</P>
        <P>The Food at Farmleigh model has been a resounding success and I was very pleased to see that Bord Bia hosted a food market in Farmleigh on Mayday with the participation of 28 of Ireland&rsquo;s finest speciality and artisan producers who offered a range of farmhouse cheeses, smoked salmon-eel-mackerel, preserves, cakes and biscuits, confectionery and charcuterie.</P>
        <P>My Department has raised with Office of Public Works, OPW, the possibility of extending the successful Food at Farmleigh model style markets to other appropriate OPW sites. Bord Bia and OPW officials have begun discussion on how best to advance this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In October last, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December, the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or with the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which had been delivered in March 2004.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April. I understand that a revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, will be sent to the Commission very shortly. Ireland has already submitted proposals for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive, designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. They were developed by my Department and Teagasc in consultation with the Department of the Envir<Col N="1324"/>onment, Heritage and Local Government. The Commission has stated that it will not consider the application for a derogation until the action programme itself is agreed and in place but I am hopeful for a favourable outcome.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. Effective promotion and marketing of beef by Bord Bia and the industry has ensured a presence for top quality Irish beef in all the key European markets. This includes supply arrangements with multiples and the main retailers in the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>The overall approach in the marketing of Irish beef is to build continually on its reputation as a high quality and safety assured product based on a natural, extensive and well controlled cattle production sector at farm level. The new beef quality assurance scheme, EN45011, is now operational and Bord Bia will shortly promote the scheme to encourage the widest possible farmer uptake.</P>
        <P>A strong interest in Irish beef has been generated by building its reputation through the media, by chefs endorsements and the creation of demand from premium chefs-restaurants in each of these markets. The main goal of our marketing strategy is to increase retail market penetration and to invest in growing Irish beef awareness. This is being achieved by building relationships with key customers, product promotions and image building of the brand.</P>
        <P>The reform of the CAP means farmers will enjoy greater freedom to grow and develop their enterprises producing for consumer requirements supported by the single farm payment. A targeted approach based on quality production represents the best and most profitable way forward for the Irish industry. This is particularly the case in the post-decoupling context when the market will be the sole determinant of the nature and scale of output from the sector. In such a context, there will be a need for even greater emphasis on good breeding policies, payment related to quality and sophisticated and integrated supply and purchasing systems.</P>
        <P>Regarding third country trade, important markets such as Russia, Algeria and Egypt have re-opened for Irish beef while the Lebanon is open for live exports. Access to the Algerian market has now been broadened to include <Col N="1325"/>frozen beef in addition to fresh and chilled product. A delegation from my Department and Bord Bia recently visited Egypt and along with embassy officials held positive discussions with the Egyptian authorities with a view to relaxing the conditions under which exports to that country can take place. It is hoped to finalise a protocol with Egypt on these new conditions later this year. I have obtained the agreement of the European Commission to the continuation of the special export refund for Egypt which will also greatly assist trade during the year.</P>
        <P>I am committed to opening all international markets to Irish beef and my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve that aim.</P>

	<P>MRSA, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, is an antibiotic resistant bacterium, the presence of which in humans was noted over 35 years ago and which has been a feature of antibiotic resistance in human therapy since. During the past two years, the presence of the bacterium has been noted in animals, in particular, dogs and horses. It is thought that the route of infection has been from pet owners and veterinary practitioners.</P>
        <P>I am aware that earlier this year, Veterinary Ireland circulated its members advising them of the problem, of how to deal with cases and of procedures to be adopted to minimise risk of transmission in their practices. Veterinary Ireland has also asked practitioners to inform animal owners of the risks which can arise from contact with companion animals infected with the bacterium. I fully support this initiative.</P>

	<P>As I announced on 16 March last, I am making arrangements within my Department to facilitate the use of certain animal by-products in composting and biogas plants. These arrangements are being introduced primarily in the context of EU legislation that allows the digestate produced in such plants to be spread on non-pastureland. In coming to a decision on this, I have had regard to the declining numbers of BSE cases here and the need to provide productive outlets <Col N="1326"/>for the disposal of certain animal by-products where this does not pose a risk to public or animal health. The relevant national legislation is currently being amended to facilitate this.</P>

	<P>In general, the rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance under the single payment scheme is 1% of those farmers to whom the relevant statutory management requirement or good agricultural and environmental conditions apply. However, at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the animal identification and registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant EU regulations.</P>
        <P>In addition to cross-compliance checks, it is a requirement to carry out standard eligibility checks to verify that the actual area claimed in the single payment application form corresponds with the area held by the farmer and to ensure that there are no overlapping or duplication of parcels claimed.</P>
        <P>The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross-compliance are in place for many years now. Producers are generally familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland.</P>
        <P>My Department prepared a consultative document on cross-compliance in October 2004 and invited views from interested organisations. Department officials met the main farming organisations in December 2004 to discuss their submissions. An information booklet on cross-compliance has been issued to all farmers and it sets out the principle features of cross-compliance both in terms of the standards that must be met by farmers and the control arrangements that will be necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of countrywide farmer information meetings organised by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc, took place in early April. These meetings focused not only on cross-compliance but also addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>In implementing the single payment scheme, I am aiming to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross-compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 or so inspections, which were carried under the old regime, will be significantly reduced to some 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers.</P><Col N="1327"/>
        <P>The EU regulations governing the cross-compliance sanctions system sets out a range of percentage reductions. For infringement of a legal standard, a 3% reduction is proposed but this could be reduced to 1% or increased to 5% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement. If the non-compliance were repeated a multiplier of three must be applied. In the case of intentional infringement, a 20% reduction is proposed but this could be reduced to 15% or increased to 100% depending on the extent, severity and permanence of the infringement.</P>
        <P>My Department has recently been engaged in intensive negotiations with the farming bodies on the implementation of cross-compliance under the single payment scheme in the context of drawing up a new protocol on the delivery of all of my Department&rsquo;s schemes and services to farmers.</P>
        <P>My Department regards the following principles as being central to the implementation of a sanctions system under the single payment scheme: procedures are fair, equitable, proportional and transparent; the system is standardised to the maximum extent possible across all areas of the country; and the client&rsquo;s rights are protected.</P>
        <P>To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to put in place mechanisms that will take due account of whether any non-compliance found is: on its own minor in nature; negligent; or intentional. During the negotiations on the protocol, my Department tabled a paper outlining its proposals including a system of weightings to be applied for infringements of the statutory management requirements with due tolerances for minor infringements which, on their own, are regarded as inadvertent breaches capable of occurring in practical farm situations. The system has become know as the penalty points system. While some of the farming organisations were initially reluctant to accept the Department&rsquo;s proposals it is premature to suggest that agreement cannot be reached.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been a number of positive developments in the area of food labelling, most of which emanated from the report of the food labelling group which was established in June 2002. The group reported in December of that year with a series of recommendations. The recommendations were accepted. As food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area, involving a number of Departments and agencies, an interdepartmental-agency group was <Col N="1328"/>established to progress the implementation of the report.</P>
        <P>Good progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations in the labelling report. There were a total of 21 recommendations, many of which are beyond the remit of my Department and some of which were to be activated only after others had been completed.</P>
        <P>The two main issues that emanated from the recommendations of the labelling group were centralising enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin. Enforcement of all of the food labelling regulations has now been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This will not only streamline the enforcement measures but it will also provide a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. The centralisation of food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, in both the Department of Health and Children and my Department achieves another recommendation of the food labelling group. There was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers&rsquo; wishes in this area. The consumer liaison panel has carried out this research, the results of which were presented in December 2003.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of 2004, two regulations on the labelling of poultry meat were introduced. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat, loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second, requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultrymeat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer.</P>
        <P>EU regulations provide for a detailed labelling system for beef to be applied at retail sale, which is over and above the general labelling provisions. These regulations do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level. It is my intention to proceed with a legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef served on such premises. The legal options allowing for this development are being examined at present. An internal committee has been established in my Department to consider the options.</P>
        <P>On the food labelling issue in general, I must emphasise that my primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and, indeed, there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels. I hope to achieve this through the implementation in as full a manner as possible of the recommend<Col N="1329"/>ations of the food labelling group. I have also indicated my views on labelling of foodstuffs in the Council of Agriculture Ministers and have, along with a number of member states, asked the Commission to examine how best food labelling should be handled at EU level in order to best protect the interests of the consumer.</P>
        <P>There have been significant developments on food labelling and I am satisfied that other issues of concern are being actively addressed. Today&rsquo;s consumers should be in a position to make food consumption choices which best suit their circumstances and preferences, and an appropriate labelling system is a key element in bringing this about. It is also important to keep in touch with developments in the EU to ensure that any regulations adopted for the Community appropriately address our concerns.</P>

	<P>The classification of all of County Monaghan as a more severely handicapped disadvantaged area has cleared all the hurdles in Brussels, as was announced last week by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith.</P>
        <P>I am extremely pleased at this news which meets a commitment made to the social partners in Sustaining Progress. The agreement of the European Commission to my Department&rsquo;s proposals means that some 750 farmers in the 322 townlands involved in County Monaghan will receive the higher &euro;88.88 per hectare more severely handicapped rate of payment from 2005 on as compared with the lower &euro;76.18 less severely handicapped rate per hectare which they have been receiving up to now.</P>
        <P>These 750 beneficiaries farming around 12,500 hectares will receive between them an additional &euro;160,000 each year as a result. Assuming they are eligible for compensatory allowances, all they have to do this year to qualify for the higher payment rate is complete their single payment application form in exactly the same way as they would have completed it if they were still only going to receive payments at the lower rate.</P>

      </Qst><Col N="1330"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The price paid for milk is a commercial matter between milk producers and purchasers. The manufactured milk prices are determined by a number of factors, including the international market for dairy products, the product mix and the efficiency of the processor as well as the overall operation of the EU price support mechanisms.</P>
        <P>My role, as Minister for Agriculture and Food, is to ensure that the areas within my scope of influence such as the EU market management measures are implemented in a manner which enables the dairy sector remain competitive and thereby continue to develop and support farmers&rsquo; incomes. It is reassuring to note that milk producer prices in Ireland have remained stable for several years.</P>
        <P>As part of the reform of the mid-term review of the Common Agriculture Policy producers have been compensated to the tune of &euro;60 million for reductions in intervention prices of butter and skim milk powder. Compensation for these support price reductions takes the form of a direct payment to farmers amounting to approximately 1.2 cent per litre at present rising to 2.4 cent per litre as a decoupled payment later this year. The first intervention price cuts for butter amounting to 7% and skim milk powder, SMP, amounting to 5% took place on 1 July 2004 without any adverse effect on producer prices.</P>
        <P>While stability is being maintained in milk prices, undoubtedly the changing nature of EU support for dairying will require a more market-oriented approach by the dairy sector in the future. This focus will, in particular, require a lessening of dependence on intervention and a renewed emphasis on competitiveness and increased efficiencies at all levels of the industry.</P>
        <P>On a more general note on production at farm level, producers will also have to look at increasing the scale of their operations, reducing costs where possible, and improving the quality of the milk they produce. While the mid-term reform of the CAP has ensured the extension of the quota regime until 2014-15, it is imperative now, more than ever, to assist those who wish to expand their operations within this new environment. My decision to decouple the dairy premium from 2005, which has been positively received within the dairy sector, should help those who wish to expand. Also, the milk quota restructuring scheme which I announced at the end of last year, and which set a stepped down quota price for two years should also help producers, who wish to expand, gain access to available quota at a reasonable price.</P>
        <P>The future development of the dairy sector and, in particular, price stability to milk producers, remains a priority for me. It must be recognised, however, that we are operating in a more global economic environment where many external forces come into play. I will do my utmost to encourage the dairy sector to make the <Col N="1331"/>necessary changes, both at producer and processor level to strengthen and improve its position in the increasingly competitive international markets in which it operates.</P>

	<P>Implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The nitrates action programme may have implications for the intensive farming sector, particularly in terms of the utilisation of the manure produced by intensive pig and poultry units. Accordingly, I have asked my officials to examine various aspects of intensive production in the context of the action programme, including feeding regimes and the storage, treatment and utilisation of manure. I have also asked them to look at the REPS specifications to see how far manure could be accommodated, in place of artificial fertiliser, within the REPS nutrient management regime.</P>
        <P>It remains my objective, and it is also the objective of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to reach agreement on an action programme that meets the objectives of the nitrates directive in terms of safeguarding water quality while also minimising the burden of compliance that the agreement will place on farmers and safeguarding the future of the commercial farming sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has already provided incentives to encourage organic farming which are substantial in proportion to the size of the sector. Through the rural environment protection scheme, almost &euro;4 million was paid directly to organic farmers in 2004. Since REPS began in 1994, it has delivered some &euro;31 million to the sector. Under the current scheme, an organic farmer with 55 hectares is eligible for an annual payment in REPS 3 of &euro;18,505 a year for the first two years, and &euro;13,555 each year for the rest of his or her time in the scheme. As a further incentive to encourage conventional farmers to venture into organic production, REPS now allows them to convert part of the farm instead of the entire holding as previously.</P>
        <P>My Department also operates the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, which supports investment both on-farm and off-farm. For on-farm investments, grant aid can be given for 40% of the cost up to a maximum grant of over &euro;50,000. For off-farm investments, the maximum grant is more than &euro;500,000.</P>
        <P>In addition, my Department has implemented all the main recommendations of the organic development committee&rsquo;s report published in April 2002, including the establishment of a national steering group. This group, made up of a broad range of stakeholder, has met on nine occasions and continues to monitor the implementation of the other recommendations of the organic development committee.</P>
        <P>The decoupling of farm payments establishes a new policy framework in which farmers will have the freedom to farm in response to market demands. In this more market-oriented scenario, there is real scope for organic production to expand with the help of the financial incentives that I have outlined already. I strongly urge farmers to give it serious thought.</P>
        <P>Ultimately, however, it is the producer and the consumer between them who will determine the size of the Irish organic sector. I do not accept that Ireland&rsquo;s clean green image is in need of rescue or that it depends on the level of organic farming in the country. By the end of the year, I expect that we will have 50,000 farmers in REPS, farming to a standard that goes beyond good farming practice. The bulk of the remaining farmers will be in the single payment scheme and will be under an obligation to keep their land in good agricultural and environmental condition. In these circumstances, I foresee no difficulty in preserving and further enhancing the image of Irish food.</P>

	<P>I made arrangements last month to expedite balancing payments to farmers affected by the special beef premium quota excess based on an estimated overshoot reduction. Over the past two weeks, some &euro;80 million has been paid to special beef, suckler cow and slaughter premium applicants with the vast bulk of this going to farmers with more than 25 special beef premium animals.</P>
        <P>I have also raised the matter of the overshoot with the European Commission pointing out that it was never the intention of the mid-term reform of the CAP that farmers would be disadvantaged in the transition to the single payment scheme. As the extent of the special beef premium quota excess is linked to the move to full decoupling of direct payments in 2005, I have asked the Commission to address the problem as a matter of urgency.</P>

	<P>In 2004, 126 cases of BSE were confirmed compared with 182 in 2003 and 333 in 2002. There have been 25 cases to date in 2005 which represents a decrease of 57% on the number of cases discovered in the same period in 2004, 59. The majority of these cases were in animals born prior to the introduction here of the additional controls in 1996 and 1997. The shift in age profile in BSE cases as well as a reduction in case numbers indicates that the additional controls have been effective in significantly reducing the exposure of animals born after 1997 to the infectious agent. It is expected that the incidence of disease will continue to decline as cows born prior to 1998 leave the system.</P>
        <P>Investigations are carried out into the feeding regimes of all herds in which BSE is identified and in particular in herds in which cases born after the feed controls were re-enforced are confirmed. Within the context of the overall picture, the diagnosis of BSE in a small number of animals born after 1997 was to be expected. To date, 11 animals born after 1997, four in 1998 and seven in 1999, have been diagnosed with BSE. In addition, ten cases were confirmed in 1997 born animals but some of these were born before all the enhanced measures were fully in place. My Department had foreseen the likelihood that individual cases would from time to time arise which may relate to circumstances specific to the farms in question and which do not conform with the general trend as the incidence of the disease in the national herd recedes. There is, however, no basis for suspecting that these cases are indicative of either a systemic failure in controls or of a reversal of or deviation from the overall positive trend in relation to BSE in Ireland.</P>

        <Quest>the measures she intends to take to address the problems experienced by farmers in the Shannon Callows, as a result of current proposals which do not allow them to split their lands for grant aid purposes between REPS funding and funding allocated under the SAC and SPA designation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The designation of land under the EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon Callows area is <Col N="1337"/>a matter, in the first instance, for that Department, and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are not yet concluded.</P>
        <P>As far as REPS is concerned, I have already introduced arrangements designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon Callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the directives, may now also apply to the national parks and wildlife service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, they had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both. Since farmers in the Shannon Callows are thus provided with a means by which they are guaranteed full compensation, it is difficult to see how there could be justification for even more advantageous arrangements.</P>
        <P>This further concession was additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments under REPS measure A of &euro;242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares, and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of &euro;100 per hectare on particular sites in the Callows which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland, and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.</P>
        <P>REPS is a highly successful agri-environment measure and is acknowledged as such by the European Commission. One of the features of REPS which the Commission has commended is the fact that the whole farm is subjected to the full range of basic undertakings. This model has served Irish farmers well since the introduction of REPS in 1994 and it is not my intention to depart from the whole farm approach to accommodate a situation which I have already addressed adequately.</P>

        <P>Last November, the decentralisation implementation group published its report to the Minister for Finance identifying the organisations to move in the first phase of the decentralisation programme and included the decentralisation of 392 Department of Agriculture and Food staff from Dublin to Portlaoise. A further report from the decentralisation implementation group is expected shortly to deal with locations not covered in last November&rsquo;s report.</P>
        <P>Following the Government&rsquo;s announcement in budget 2004, my Department established a decentralisation implementation committee, chaired by an Assistant Secretary General, to plan and control the process. Tangible progress has been made on the decentralisation of my Department to Portlaoise already, with some 50 staff having been assigned there in July 2004.</P>
        <P>In accordance with recommendations made in the decentralisation implementation group report of November 2004, my Department submitted a revised implementation plan to the decentralisation implementation group on 14 February 2005 which sets out the sequence and proposed timescale in which work areas of my Department will be moved to Portlaoise.

	<P>Both Ministers of State at my Department have met groups set up to advance the interests of retired farmers. Officials of my Department have also had meetings with them on several occasions. The group referred to had an opportunity to present its case to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food and the committee has recently produced its report. My officials are examining the report and I will respond formally to the committee in due course. Most of the issues raised by the group were also put to the European Commission in the form of a complaint about the way my Department had introduced and implemented the scheme of early <Col N="1339"/>retirement from farming and I note that the Commission rejected the complaint.</P>
        <P>Certain of the group&rsquo;s concerns related to the implications for retired farmers of the introduction of the new single payment scheme. My Department has been aware, from an early stage in the negotiations leading to the introduction of the single payment scheme, of the possible implications for retired farmers who had leased their holdings. In so far as it has proved possible in the context of the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, and following lengthy discussions with the European Commission, provision has been made under the rules of the single payment scheme to address some of the concerns of retired farmers.</P>
        <P>As participants in the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming had retired before the start of the reference period in 2000, they are not in a position to claim entitlements under the single payment scheme. However, a concession agreed with the European Commission will allow family members who take over a holding that was leased to third parties during the reference period to have access to entitlements from the national reserve. This will benefit the family members of retired farmers who decide to take up farming.</P>
        <P>Participants in the current early retirement scheme, who would have farmed during part or all of the reference period, can activate entitlements and lease them to their existing transferee. If the transferee does not want the entitlements, the transferor &mdash; retired farmer &mdash; has until 2007 within which to lease or transfer the entitlements, with land, to another farmer. My Department has recently written to these retired farmers advising them on how to activate entitlements.</P>

	<P>The 2004 enterprise strategy group report to the T&aacute;naiste entitled, Ahead of the Curve, focused on marketing as one of two development axes for Irish industry, the other being technology. Promotion and marketing is becoming ever more critical as the Irish agri-food sector enters a period of great change with future production decisions becoming more market led and influenced by decoupling policy under the Luxembourg Agreement, EU enlargement and a new WTO round. A clearly focused strategic marketing and promotion policy is essential to assist the food industry here in exploiting market opportunities.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia plays a leading role in supporting the food industry in the development and consolidation of export markets. It is widely acknowledged as doing a very effective job and its success in promoting Ireland as a food island is <Col N="1340"/>evidenced by the record results for 2004, when the value of food exports crossed the &euro;7 billion mark for the first time.</P>
        <P>In the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004, public expenditure of &euro;28.69 million was allocated to funding the food marketing and promotion measure of the national development plan. The measure is administered by Bord Bia and covers grant assistance to companies to improve its individual marketing capabilities and the board&rsquo;s generic market development activities. These activities include marketing promotion and advertising, market research studies and information-publications, development of marketing skills, quality and training.</P>
        <P>The organisation has recently undertaken an independent strategic review of its future direction. This included wide-ranging consultation, internally and externally, and I expect to receive a report on the outcome in the near future. This review will enable Bord Bia to remain focused on its mission, which in turn will help secure a more diverse, competitive and export orientated food industry.</P>

	<P>The review and appraisal of Ireland&rsquo;s forestry development strategy undertaken by Peter Bacon and Associates supports a planting target of 20,000 hectares per annum, as set out in the programme for Government.

	<P>It is estimated that there are in excess of 450,000 cattle in the national herd which were born before 1996. It is difficult to put an accurate value on such animals since their value to farmers is measured in terms of the calves and milk produced on an annual basis rather than by reference to what they would command at the market or in the factory. However, based on recent values of BSE suspects in this age category, the value of such animals would range from &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 per animal. Taking the lower figure, the value of all pre-1996 born animals left in the population would be at least &euro;225 million. Trends observed over recent years indicate that approximately 165 cases of BSE &mdash; range 112-210 &mdash; are expected to be diagnosed in Ireland between 2005-10. Using that figure and the average cost of compensation for herd depopulation in 2004, the projected gross cost of compensation of herd depopulation as a result of BSE from 2005 to 2010 would be approximately &euro;18.6 million. It should be emphasised that these are very tentative estimates based on certain assumptions and do not include slaughter, rendering, transport, disposal, etc., costs.</P>
        <P>In March 2002, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland produced a report from its BSE sub-committee looking at strategies to reduce the incidence of BSE in Ireland, and whether these add value in terms of consumer protection over the existing control measures. The findings in that report were that provided all existing controls and regulations are strictly complied with, there was no added food safety value in a cull of older cattle in pre-clinical stages of the disease.</P>

	<P>Avian influenza is a serious, highly contagious viral disease of poultry which can also spread to other animals and occasionally to humans. EU legislation to control avian influenza is laid down in Directive 92/40/EEC. In brief, this directive requires that all suspected cases of avian influenza must be investigated and appropriate measures taken in case of confirmation of highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI.

	<P>EU legislation, jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, on the cultivation of GM crops specifically prohibits the unilateral declaration of a GM free country. There are, however, methods available to restrict the growing of GM crops within regions of a country. These include the concept of voluntarily developed GM free regions &mdash; a concept being explored by a number of regional communities and authorities throughout the Community and one which could be examined by communities within this country. Another option is to seek a derogation from the Commission that, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, co-existence is not possible in certain regions in respect of certain named crops. The cultivation of these crops can then be legitimately prohibited if the case made is accepted by the Commission.</P><Col N="1344"/>
        <P>The legislative framework on GMOs adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers, and which is binding on all members states, provides for a series of controls along the whole supply chain which ensures that only food which meets the highest possible levels of safety is produced and marketed in this country.</P>

	<P>Teagasc, the agriculture and food development authority, was established under the Agriculture (Research, Training and Advice) Act 1988. Its function under the Act is to provide research, training and advisory services for the agrifood sector. Teagasc is governed by an 11 member authority. The chairman and five ordinary members are appointed by the Minister and the remaining five members are appointed by the Minister following nominations from designated organisations &mdash; IFA, ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and Teagasc unions.</P>
        <P>Teagasc has approximately 1,300 permanent staff, comprising advisers, teachers and research scientists with appropriate supporting services. These are complemented by some 250 contract staff, as well as teaching staff in the private agricultural and horticultural colleges. Teagasc staff carry out their functions from more than 90 locations.</P>
        <P>Teagasc&rsquo;s operating budget for 2005 amounts to more than &euro;155 million. Advisory services make up the biggest budget item, 35% of expenditure, followed by production research, 32%, training programmes, 19%, and food research, 13%. My Department&rsquo;s provision to Teagasc for capital and non-capital purposes in 2005 amounts <Col N="1345"/>to &euro;123 million. The amount for non-capital purposes is &euro;118.5 million and for capital development purposes the allocation is &euro;4.5 million. By any standards these are substantial resources and are a clear indication of the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to supporting Teagasc activities.</P>
        <P>It is the responsibility of Teagasc to prioritise activities and to allocate its funding accordingly. This it has done over the years in accordance with the needs of clients, EU and Government policy and industry needs. I am satisfied that in doing so, it has provided a first class service to Irish farmers.</P>
        <P>In the short term, Teagasc will have to reconfigure its programmes in response to the fundamental changes in agriculture arising out of the new CAP support framework. The authority is, however, already well accustomed to tailoring its programmes to meet the changing requirements of the agri-food sector. Its annual programme of activities is developed in consultation with the key stakeholders in the sector many of whom are represented on the authority. Recently, it has undertaken more strategic planning initiatives, the Teagasc 2000 review and the three year strategy required under the strategic management initiative. A new review of its training and education programmes has recently got under way.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that Teagasc is well placed to face the future and to continue to provide the innovation and technology transfer for the sustainable development of agriculture, the food industry and rural communities in the years ahead.</P>

As Minister, I hold a special share in Greencore plc.

	<P>European Council Regulation 1782/2003 governing the single payment scheme provides that each member state must set up a national reserve using between 1% and 3% of every individual farmers entitlements. A single payment advisory group comprising representatives from the farming organisations, Teagasc and officials from my Department was set up to advise on the national reserve. A 3% provisional reduction for the national reserve is reflected in the certificates of provisional entitlements that have already issued to some 140,000 farmers. I have decided that in the event of the sum of individual payment entitlements for Irish farmers exceeding our financial ceiling, thus necessitating a linear percentage reduction for all farmers, such linear percentage reduction would be accommodated within the 3% provisional reduction already applied for the national reserve.</P>
        <P>The Council regulation also provides for a reduction for modulation of 3% in 2005 rising by a further 1% in each of the years 2006 and 2007. The 3% deduction for modulation has also been reflected in the provisional statements of entitlements, which have already issued. However, a refund of this money will be made in respect of the first &euro;5,000 of the single payment in each case. It is estimated that 46% of Irish farmers will in effect, not be subject to modulation at all.</P>

	<P>The Deputy is aware that the High Court, in respect of a judicial review of the seizure and detention by my officials of certain corn gluten imported into this country, recently ruled in favour of the company referred to on two counts. First, the authorised officers, appointed by the Minister, did not have the necessary powers, under the Irish legislation quoted, to impound the feed material and instruct its recall from the market and, second, the Minister could not prove that the presence of bone fragments in the corn gluten, identified by reference to the analytical methods approved by the EU and applied across the EU, indicated the presence of processed animal protein, PAPs.</P>
        <P>This judgment has been appealed to the Supreme Court and officials in my Department are in consultation with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office to examine ways to strengthen the existing <Col N="1347"/>national legislation pertaining to inspection and seizure powers. Secondary legislation in this regard will be introduced by me very shortly.

        <P>I have also raised the matter of the overshoot with the European Commission pointing out that it was never the intention of the mid-term reform of the Common Agricultural Policy that farmers would be disadvantaged in the transition to the single payment scheme.

	<P>The Joint Oireachtas Committee which examined the Barron report into the 1974 bombings last year recommended the establishment of a commission of investigation to examine matters relevant to this jurisdiction including specific aspects of the Garda investigation at the time and missing documentation. The Government has established a commission of investigation in accordance with that recommendation with Mr. Patrick MacEntee, SC, as sole member. It is a matter for the commission of investigation to determine how it will operate, including with regard to access to relevant documentation, in accordance with its terms of reference and its powers under the relevant legislation.</P>

	<P>The health contribution levy was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on 6 April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and proceeds are paid to the Minister for Health and Children in aid of the vote for health. Subject to certain exemptions, the levy is applicable to all persons over the age of 16 with reckonable income. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income.</P><Col N="1350"/>
        <P>According to Regulation (EC) 1408/71, a person employed in one member state who resides in another member state and who returns to his state of residence at least once a week, is classed as a frontier worker. Under Article 20 of the regulation:</P>
        <P LI="1">A frontier worker may. . . .obtain benefits in the territory of the competent state. Such benefits shall be provided by the competent institution in accordance with the provisions of the legislation of that State, as though the person concerned were resident in that State.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This provision is designed to ensure that the frontier worker can obtain all health services in both the member state of employment and the member state of residence, in both cases at the cost of the competent institution.</P>
        <P>In the case of a frontier worker employed in Ireland and resident in Northern Ireland, the competent state is Ireland and the competent institution is the Health Service Executive. Thus, under the regulation, such a person is entitled to obtain health care both in Northern Ireland or in Ireland, but in both cases the competent state &mdash; Ireland &mdash; and the competent institution &mdash; the Health Service Executive &mdash; are responsible for the costs. Under the bilateral agreement on reimbursement of health care costs that exists between Ireland and the UK and as provided for in Regulation (EC) 574/72, Ireland reimburses the UK for the cost of health care provided to those persons resident in Northern Ireland or any other part of the United Kingdom who are employed in Ireland and who therefore receive health services in the UK, under Regulation (EC) 1408/71, on behalf of and at the cost of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Therefore, when a person resident in Northern Ireland is employed in this State, he or she is liable to health contributions on the same basis as any other individual employed in the State unless he or she is exempt from the payment of health contributions on any of the grounds provided for in the legislation.</P>

	<P>An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, Registrar General, is responsible for the registration of all life events, including births. Oifig an Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir has received correspondence from a person in Dublin 9 concerning a submission to amend the provisions of the Civil Registration Act 2004. The submission is mainly concerned with the issues of re-registration in cases involving unmarried parents and the child&rsquo;s surname details that may be re-registered.</P>
        <P>Section 23 of the 2004 Act provides that where registration has occurred without the father&rsquo;s details in cases where the parents were not married to each other at the date of the birth or at any time during the previous ten months, re-registration of a person as father of a child can occur only at the joint request of the mother and the person acknowledging himself to be the father of the child, or at the request of the mother on production by her of a declaration as to the putative father&rsquo;s identity and his statutory declaration acknowledging fatherhood, or at the request of the putative father on production of his declaration acknowledging fatherhood and the mother&rsquo;s statutory declaration of confirmation, or at the request of the mother or putative father in writing on production of a certified copy of any court order in respect of proceedings relating to section 45 of the Status of Children Act 1987 naming the father of the child.</P>
        <P>Provisions relating to surname details are contained in the Registration of Births Act 1996, as amended by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous <Col N="1352"/>Provisions) Act 2002. The procedures dealing with the registration or re-registration of the child&rsquo;s surname are: births registered on or after 1 October 1997 with both parents details included on the birth entry cannot be re-registered and the surname assigned cannot be changed; for births registered on or after 1 October 1997 with the mother&rsquo;s details and surname only, the surname assigned may be changed on re-registration if both parents consent; for births registered before 1 October 1997 the surname assigned on re-registration can be the mother&rsquo;s or father&rsquo;s as they appear in the register, or of both. Once assigned the surname cannot be changed at a later date.</P>
        <P>Births re-registered between 1 October 1997 and 15 October 2002 where the parents were obliged to re-register with the mother&rsquo;s surname may be re-registered for a second time to change the surname if both parents consent. The consent of both parents in issues involving re-registration and child&rsquo;s surname details is a fundamental principle of the legislation. In cases where consent is not given by either party, An tArd-Chl&aacute;raitheoir has no legislative authority to arbitrate or decide upon the surname details to be registered as such judgements are appropriate to the courts of law.</P>
        <P>The actual forename and surname used in connection with a child is not a matter for the registration service. It is a matter for a parent or parents to decide on the name by which a child is known. A person&rsquo;s legal name is that by which the person is known and a person acquires the right to it by use and repute.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Under EU rules, only authorised GM foods, or foods containing ingredients thereof, can be imported and placed on the market. Ireland applies EU legislation on genetically modified, GM, foods. The following GM foods are authorised for sale on the Irish market: vegetable oil from oil seed rape; vegetable oil from cotton seed; maize products; soya products.</P>
        <P>These products are normally used as food ingredients and the following are the food types in which the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, has identified GM ingredients: vegetable casserole, gluten-free reduced sugar rusks, soya protein mince, soya protein chunks, soya biscuits and cakes, soya bran, soya flour, infant formula, soya cream, soya yogurt, soya drink, soya dessert, lecithin granules derived from soya bean and maize meal, tortilla chips, taco shells, breadcrumbs for chicken and burger and corn snacks derived from maize.</P>
        <P>However, the above list does not mean that there are not other food types on the market with GM maize or soya ingredients. Further authorisations of GM foods will only occur following full independent safety assessment by the European Food Safety Authority and are subject to the latest European regulations with regard to traceability and labelling.</P>
        <P>Two regulations which govern the labelling of food products containing genetically modified <Col N="1354"/>organisms, GMOs, 1829/2003 and 1830/2003, became applicable in April of last year. These regulations have amended the rules on the labelling of foods produced from GMOs to require labelling irrespective of whether DNA or protein of GM origin is present in the final product. Consequently, highly refined or processed food such as starch, sugar and oil products which may not have any residual DNA or protein require labelling if derived from GMOs. The regulations include a traceability system to verify the origin of the food. Labels have to indicate either, &ldquo;This product contains genetically modified organisms&rdquo; or &ldquo;... produced from genetically modified (name of organism)&rdquo;. These regulations, which operators are required to comply with, are effective since April 2004.</P>
        <P>Trace levels of GMOs in conventional food and feed can and do arise during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing. This is not particular to GMOs but can occur in the production of food, feed and seed with the result that it is difficult to achieve products that are 100% pure. Against this background, the EU&rsquo;s objective is to ensure legal certainty and establish certain thresholds above which conventional food and feed have to be labelled as consisting of, or containing, or being produced from a GMO. Under current legislation the presence of GM material in conventional food does not have to be labelled if it is below 0.9%, previously 1%, and if it can be shown to be adventitious and technically unavoidable.</P>
        <P>The FSAI is the competent authority in Ireland for the enforcement of EU legislation regarding the genetic modification of foodstuffs. The FSAI carries out checks in the marketplace to ensure compliance with relevant legislation.</P>

	<P>I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the family on their tragic loss. As the Deputy may be aware, the Medical Council is the independent authority charged with primary responsibility for the registration and regulation of medical practitioners in the State. The function of the Medical Council is to protect the public through implementing appropriate controls on the medical profession. Doctors practising medicine in Ireland should be registered with the Medical Council.</P>
        <P>The surgical procedure in question was undertaken outside of this country and the relevant authorities in the State concerned are investigating the circumstances in this particular case. It is not appropriate or feasible for an authority or body in this country to have jurisdiction over a doctor practising in another country.</P>
        <P>Persons who avail of the services of doctors performing cosmetic procedures, whether in this country or abroad, should endeavour to seek the services of reputable institutions. When invasive procedures are being arranged in so-called cosmetic clinics, persons would be strongly advised to check that the services are provided by a medical practitioner who is appropriately registered with the Medical Council in this country or the appropriate regulatory body in the jurisdiction where the procedure is to be performed. In addition, before agreeing to undergo any procedure, persons should ascertain the level of follow-up medical support which will be available to them after the surgery has been completed.</P>
        <P>It is an offence under the Medical Practitioners Act for a doctor to falsely represent himself or herself to be a registered medical practitioner when he or she is not registered. Registration is required to sign medical certificates and to issue prescriptions for certain categories of drugs. In addition, doctors are not entitled to recover in legal proceedings, fees charged for the provision of medical or surgical advice or treatment given when they were not registered.</P>
        <P>I have met a delegation from the Medical Council to discuss a number of matters relevant to the current and future system of regulation of the medical profession in Ireland. Among the issues discussed was that of cosmetic surgical procedures and the requirement for appropriate follow-up medical care for patients who undergo these procedures. The delegation outlined to me the council&rsquo;s concerns regarding the operation of cosmetic surgery clinics in Ireland. My Department is currently actively examining ways to address the issues raised.</P>
        <P>With regard to promotion of the particular doctor&rsquo;s services through advertising, my Depart<Col N="1357"/>ment has no role in relation to the restriction of advertising applicable in this or any other jurisdiction. In relation to advertising by medical practitioners and the provision of ethical advice generally, the Medical Council produces a guide to ethical conduct and behaviour in accordance with section 69(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act. The most recent edition of the guide was published in 2004 and includes guidelines on advertising and the media and practice announcements. The council is in a position to consider alleged breaches of the guide in respect of doctors who are registered with it. However, the council has no authority to deal with complaints against doctors whose names are not entered on its register.</P>

	<P>The supports which the Government put in place in 2004 with the objective of keeping the cost of professional indemnity cover for consultants&rsquo; private practice at an affordable <Col N="1361"/>level remain. These supports mean that most consultants need only purchase indemnity cover for the first &euro;1 million of the cost of any one claim against them. In the case of consultant obstetricians the limit is set at &euro;500,000. In addition the aggregate annual exposure of any individual consultant obstetrician is set at &euro;1.5 million. Beyond these limits the State, through the clinical indemnity scheme, will assume liability for qualifying personal injury claims. In accordance with a Labour Court recommendation issued at the end of 2004, these limits will be reviewed later this year. I am satisfied that these measures have achieved the objective of keeping indemnity cover affordable for consultants in private practice.</P>

	<P>As far as my Department is aware only one organisation, the Medical Protection Society, is at present offering professional indemnity cover to consultant obstetricians in full or part-time private practice. The only other provider of this type of cover, the Medical Defence Union, has not offered it to obstetricians since 2003. It is obviously not ideal that doctors should have to rely on a sole provider of such a vital service. However, the supports which the Government has put in place to keep the cost of this cover at an affordable level are available to both mutual defence organisations and any commercial insurers interested in entering this market. It is regrettable that no other organisation has, to date, chosen to avail of them. There is no evidence to suggest that the absence of competition in this highly specialised market is leading to the charging of excessive subscription rates. A condition of availing of the supports put in place by the Government is that the subscriptions charged are reasonable and are agreed with my Department.</P>

        <Quest>if, in relation to the special arrangements that were concluded by her Department in 2001 and 2002 for the continuation of obstetric services, the State has assessed the contingent liability involved arising from the assurances and guarantees provided by the State to consultants or the indemnity organisation involved; if the State has made any payments in respect of such guarantees; if the State has been <Col N="1362"/>notified of any claims likely to involve payments under the guarantees; if the agreements are still in force; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The agreements entered into in 2001 and 2002 with the Medical Protection Society were necessary at the time to avert a serious threat to the continuity of obstetric services in public and private hospitals. The period covered by these arrangements is from 1 March 2001 to 1 February 2004. As very few claims have yet emerged from this period it is difficult to come up with an accurate estimate of the value of the claims which will ultimately have to be paid. It must be borne in mind that the consultants covered by the arrangements will be co-defendants with other doctors and hospitals in these claims. The apportionment of liability, and the consequent share of the costs to be borne by the consultants, will vary from case to case. In addition, the State will benefit from the transfer of the funds established under the agreements.</P>
        <P>Using some simplifying assumptions about the number of likely successful claims, likely average cost of settlements and share of liability the total cost to the State of settling these claims could range from &euro;70 million to &euro;90 million at present day values. This cost will be offset by the value of the funds to be transferred to the State. The State has made no payments to date on foot of these arrangements. My Department has been notified of a total of 21 claims which may fall to be covered by the agreements. It is difficult to say at this stage how many of these will involve the making of any payment. The funds to be transferred to the State under the agreements will be the first source used to finance the cost of settling these claims. The agreements effectively terminated on 1 February 2004 when claims against consultants were included in the clinical indemnity scheme. Discussions are continuing with the Medical Protection Society on the arrangements for the formal transfer of the balance of the funds to the State.</P>

	<P>There are currently no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions for the long-term illness scheme, LTI. Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long-term illness scheme. The conditions are: mental handi<Col N="1363"/>cap; mental illness, for people under 16 only; phenylketonuria; cystic fibrosis; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; diabetes mellitus; diabetes insipidus; haemophilia; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; muscular dystrophies; Parkinsonism; conditions arising from thalidomide; and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.</P>
        <P>Other schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief officer of the relevant Health Service Executive area. In determining eligibility, the chief officer has regard to the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances. Income guidelines are used to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person&rsquo;s income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief officer considers that the person&rsquo;s medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
        <P>Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than &euro;85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</P>

	<P>The mobility allowance is a monthly payment administered by the Health Service Executive, which provides financial support to severely disabled people who are unable to walk or use public transport and is intended to enable them to benefit from a change in surroundings, for example, by financing the occasional taxi journey.</P>
        <P>To be eligible to receive the mobility allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years &mdash; however, an allowance, once granted, will be continued after the age of 66 as long as the other criteria for eligibility are met; be living at home or maintained by a health board in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons; and be in a condition to benefit from a change in surroundings.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant Health Service Executive area to decide whether the medical criteria are satisfied in each case. Applicants must also undergo a means test to decide eligibility. The administering of a means test for the purpose of eligibility to the mobility allowance is in line with the qualifying conditions laid down by the Department of Social and Family Affairs for eligibility to the allowances paid by that Department. My Department currently has no plans to review this qualifying criteria.</P>

	<P>Under the Health (Amendment) Act 1986, the Health Service Executive may impose charges on all patients for treatment arising out of injuries sustained in road traffic accidents where compensation is subsequently payable. The Act does not withdraw eligibility for public hospital services from road traffic accident victims, but allows health boards to recover the costs of all services provided to the them. Following enactment of the legislation my Department directed that charges be calculated on the basis of the hospital&rsquo;s average daily cost. Following legal challenge, the Supreme Court, in its judgment on 11 July 2001, ruled that this costing approach is reasonable, proper and<i> intra vires</i> the Health (Amendment) Act 1986.</P>
        <P>Letters were issued by my Department to the health boards outlining the judgment and directing them to charge the average daily cost in all road traffic accident cases. While bills are generally issued in all road traffic accident cases they are only settled where compensation is received and then forwarded to hospitals. Compensation may be significantly reduced in cases where contributory negligence is established. In the event of a person failing to obtain a compensation award, that person will only be liable for the normal statutory and maintenance charges, where applicable.</P>
        <P>The administration of the charging system is a matter for the Health Service Executive and my Department has no function in this regard.</P>

	<P>Food labelling by its nature encompasses a particularly broad spectrum and in these circumstances officials in my Department are in regular communication with officials in other Departments and agencies to ensure a balanced and co-ordinated approach to labelling issues both at national and international level.</P>
        <P>Consumers should be in a position to make food consumption choices which best suit their circumstances and preferences and an appropriate labelling system is a key element to enable this informed choice. In this regard the Deputy may note that I have recently signed a statutory instrument to effect the transposition of EU Directive 2003/89/EC which will facilitate a real improvement in food labelling. The new regulation abolishes the 25% compound ingredient listing exemption and makes it compulsory to list all ingredients in a food with the exception of a small number of particular cases. In addition, from 25 November next it will be compulsory to list on the labelling specified allergens whenever they or ingredients originating from them are used in foods, including alcoholic drinks. This will ensure that consumers suffering from food allergies and intolerances or those who wish to avoid eating certain ingredients for any other reason can identify those ingredients they may need or wish to eliminate from their diet.</P>
        <P>At European level the Commission proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims is nearing completion of First Reading. The pro<Col N="1370"/>posal specifies conditions for the use of nutrition and health claims made on foods and aims to ensure consumers receive accurate and meaningful information while allowing food producers to use serious and scientifically substantiated claims as a marketing tool.</P>
        <P>At national level discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food on the question of the introduction of national measures to require the country of origin to be displayed in respect of beef served in the restaurant and catering sector. We are considering the options available in terms of the legal mechanisms to give effect to such labelling. However, as it will be necessary to consult with the European Commission regarding the proposed measures, I am not in a position to give an indication as to when country of origin labelling will be introduced to this sector.</P>

        <P>The HSE service plan for 2005 was recently approved by me and, as required by relevant legislation, laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The detailed capital funding programme for hospitals for 2005 is being finalised in the context of the capital investment framework 2005-09. This process will be concluded in the near future and the HSE will then be in a position to progress its capital programme in line with overall funding resources available for 2005 or beyond. A decision on the appointment of a design team for the proposed oncology-haematology unit at Waterford Regional Hospital will be made in the context of the agreed capital framework for the executive.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 185 and 186 together.</P>
        <P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf health and personal social services. This includes responsibility for infection control including the control of MRSA. Accordingly, my Department has requested the director of the National Hospitals Office to investigate the matters raised regarding the number of hospitals in respect of which there have been reports of incidences of MRSA in each of the past three years, the extent to which an investigation took place into the cause in each case and the subsequent action taken and to reply direct to the Deputy in this regard.</P>
        <P>MRSA, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, is a resistant form of staphylococcus aureus. The health protection surveillance centre, HPSC, collects data on MRSA bacteraemia, also known as bloodstream infection or &ldquo;blood poisoning&rdquo;, as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, EARSS. In 2002, 445 cases of MRSA bacteraemia were notified to the HPSC while 477 cases were notified in 2003. Provisional figures for 2004 indicate that 533 cases of MRSA bacteraemia were notified last year. However, it should be borne in mind that the number of laboratories notifying cases increased in 2004 and thus a direct comparison between these years is probably not valid as it may just reflect the increased number of participating laboratories.</P>
        <P>To address the issue of antimicrobial resistance, including MRSA, the strategy for the control of antimicrobial resistance in Ireland, SARI, was launched in June 2001. Since then, approximately &euro;20.5 million in funding has been made available by my Department under the strategy, of which approximately &euro;4.5 million has been allocated in the current year. This SARI funding is in addition to normal hospital funding arrangements on infection control.</P>
        <P>In 1995 a Department of Health committee comprising representatives from my Department, consultant microbiologists, specialists in public health medicine, general practice and a representative from the association of infection control nurses produced a set of guidelines for the management of MRSA in acute hospital wards, including specialist units. The implementation and operation of these guidelines in acute hospitals is a matter for those hospitals in the first instance. These guidelines have been widely circulated and include an information leaflet for patients.</P>
        <P>The infection control sub-committee of the national SARI committee recently prepared draft guidelines on the control of MRSA in hospitals and community health care settings. The key recommendations cover such areas as environ<Col N="1377"/>mental cleanliness, bed occupancy levels, isolation facilities, hand hygiene, appropriate antibiotic use and protocols for the screening and detection of MRSA. These draft guidelines, based on the best evidence available internationally, are a key component in the response to MRSA in Ireland. The recommendations, when signed off by the National Hospitals Office of the HSE, will replace guidelines issued by this Department in 1995 on MRSA.</P>
        <P>At national level, MRSA bacteraemia has been included since 1 January 2004 in the revised list of notifiable diseases under the infectious diseases regulations. As such laboratories are now legally required to report cases of serious MRSA infection to the departments of public health and the HPSC. The reporting process for MRSA bacteraemia remains the same for now, that is, direct reporting to the HPSC via the EARSS protocol which is done on a quarterly basis. As MRSA bacteraemia is a laboratory diagnosed disease, notification is done per clinical laboratory rather than on a hospital by hospital basis.</P>
        <P>Effective infection control measures, including environmental cleanliness and hand hygiene, are central to the control of hospital acquired infections, including drug resistant organisms such as MRSA. The HSE and hospital managers have corporate responsibility for infection control. Infection control, including hand hygiene, is a key component in the control of MRSA. The SARI infection control sub-committee released national guidelines for hand hygiene in health care settings during 2004, which have been widely circulated by the HPSC and are available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website, <i>www.hspc.ie</i>. The ten point plan for accident and emergency which I announced in November 2004 includes provision for dedicated cleaning services and recognises the importance of hospital cleanliness. The National Hospitals Office of the Health Service Executive has identified the auditing and targeting of infection control initiatives and the enhancement of cleanliness of hospitals as priorities in its service plan for 2005.</P>

        <askee>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</askee>
        <Quest>the way in which the Mental Health Commission deals with complaints; the criteria it uses when investigating complaints against mental health service providers; and its role in involving the families of patients.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Mental Health Commission that, in general, it receives complaints directly from patients or from their families and-or relatives. The Mental Health Commission also receives complaints through third parties, including elected representatives. Complaints can be broadly divided into two main categories: clinical and non-clinical.</P><Col N="1378"/>
        <P>I understand that in responding to these complaints, the Mental Health Commission is guided by a number of principles and relevant legislative provisions. The patient&rsquo;s best interest is a primary consideration. This includes the patient&rsquo;s right to confidentiality. In some instances, therefore, complaints received from families cannot be dealt with if the patient declines to give his or her consent to information being shared with another party. If a patient detained under the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act 1945 writes to the Inspector of Mental Health Services seeking a review of the detention order, the inspector makes contact with the treating consultant psychiatrist and seeks documentation on the detention. The inspector then advises the patient of the status of the documentation and detention order. The Mental Health Act 2001, when fully commenced, will introduce a new independent review system for people admitted involuntarily to psychiatric units or hospitals.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Mental Health Commission that the provision of additional information and enhanced communication between the patient, family and service providers can often address the complaints submitted to it. The commission is finalising a model for the handling of complaints by service providers within the mental health services. When the model is finalised discussions will take place between the commission and all the service providers to facilitate the introduction of a comprehensive complaints system within the individual agencies.</P>

	<P>Arrangements with the central authorities in relation to inter-country adoption are primarily a matter for the Adoption Board. The board has remained in regular contact with the Belorussian authorities since inter-country adoptions were suspended in October 2004 and has had a number of very positive meetings with the Belorussian ambassador to Ireland since then. At the most recent meeting on 30 April 2005, the ambassador confirmed that the Belorussian authorities will be focusing their efforts on providing for domestic adoption placements and on fostering arrangements within Belarus, as is required under the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. The number of children eligible for inter-country adoption will considerably reduce as a result and foreign citizens will have to wait for long periods to adopt a child in the Republic of Belarus. The authorities <Col N="1383"/>in Belarus are compiling a register of children eligible for inter-country adoption. To date they have been unable to clarify how long this is going to take.</P>

	<P>As the competent authority for the regulation of medicinal products in Ireland, the Irish Medicines Board assesses the safety, quality and efficacy of medicinal products. The matter raised by the Deputy is one which falls within the IMB&rsquo;s remit.</P>
        <P>The use of antidepressants in children and adolescents has been the subject of continuous review at both national and EU level for some time and the IMB has actively participated in this review. With regard to the classes of antidepressants referred to by the Deputy, the board is aware of the recommendation of the European Medicines Agency and supports it. These products are not licensed for use in the treatment of depression in children in Ireland. Doctors can prescribe these products for individual patients if they feel they may be of benefit but they are advised to exercise caution. Alternative treatments for childhood depression, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, may be prescribed by child psychiatrists.</P>

	<P>The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland, commonly called PEACE II, is the programme to which the Deputy refers. The aim of this unique EU programme is to promote reconciliation and help to build a more peaceful and stable society in Northern Ireland and the six southern bordering counties, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth. It has a strong bottom-up and cross-Border focus; a minimum of 15% of funds are allocated to cross-Border activities in the public, private and community sectors. PEACE II also concentrates on those areas, groups and sectors which have suffered most from the Troubles. Projects must demonstrate capacity to promote reconciliation and peace-building.</P>
        <P>The PEACE II programme has five priorities economic renewal, social integration, inclusion and reconciliation, locally-based regeneration and development strategies, outward and forward looking regions and cross-Border co-operation.</P>
        <P>PEACE I ran from 1994 to 1999 and the duration of PEACE II was supposed to be from 2000 to 2004. However, following a joint initiative from the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister the European Council announced its support in June 2004 for an extension of the programme for a further two years to 2006. This extension will bring it in line with other structural fund programmes. The Border region received &euro;106 million between 2000 and 2004 and this was matched with &euro;35 million by the Irish Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The EU also provides approximately &euro;15 million each year to the International Fund for Ireland, IFI, which was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986 to promote economic and social advance and to promote contact, dialogue and reconciliation between Nationalists and Unionists throughout Ireland. The IFI also receives funding from the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</P>

	<P>Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995, which requires mortgage lenders to arrange mortgage protection insurance, provides for an exemption from this requirement in respect of certain loans, including in subsection 2(<i>b</i>), &ldquo;loans to persons who belong to a class of persons which would not be acceptable to an insurer, or which would only be acceptable to an insurer at a premium significantly higher than that payable by borrowers generally,&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer will be chargeable to capital gains tax on her share of the gain, unless she is entitled to retirement relief.</P>
        <P>On the transfer of an asset from one spouse to another the spouse acquiring the asset is deemed to have acquired it at the same time and for the same consideration as the other spouse. Accordingly, the chargeable gain is computed by reference to the original cost.</P>
        <P>Under section 598 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, an individual who is 55 years or over may obtain retirement relief from capital gains tax on the sale of &ldquo;qualifying assets&rdquo;. &ldquo;Qualifying assets&rdquo; include land used for the purposes of farming carried on by an individual which he/she has owned for a period of at least ten years ending on the date of the sale and which he/she has used for farming throughout that ten year period. As the taxpayer is regarded as having acquired her interest in the land 18 years ago it will treated as a &ldquo;qualifying asset&rdquo; providing she has farmed it throughout the period of ten years ending with its sale.</P>
        <P>Full retirement relief is available where the proceeds from the disposal do not exceed &euro;500,000. In that case, no tax is charged on the gains arising. If the proceeds exceed &euro;500,000, marginal relief may apply. It should be noted that this limit is an aggregate limit &mdash; the relief is limited to an aggregate consideration of &euro;500,000 for all disposals of qualifying assets made after the individual has reached 55 years of age. If the disposal of the property is to a child, and the individual meets the above conditions, the gain is exempt from capital gains tax irrespective of the amount of the proceeds.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>There has never been a tax incentive scheme targeted exclusively at the restoration of derelict buildings in general. However, there are provisions under the area-based tax incentive schemes such as the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, the rural renewal scheme and the countrywide refurbishment scheme for tax relief in respect of refurbishment and conversion expenditure incurred on certain properties. There is no <Col N="1390"/>requirement under these schemes that qualifying properties must be derelict.</P>
        <P>In the 2005 budget I directed my Department, together with the Revenue Commissioners, to undertake a thorough evaluation of the effects of all relevant tax incentive reliefs including certain area-based schemes. I also confirmed in the budget that the termination dates laid down previously in the 2004 Finance Act in respect of a number of area-based tax incentive schemes would remain unchanged.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 provides for the imposition of an annual derelict sites levy in respect of urban land registered by the relevant local authority for the purposes of the Act. The amount of this levy is 3% of the market value of the urban land concerned and remains payable until such time as the land ceases to be derelict. Revenues from the derelict sites levy may be applied by a local authority for the purpose of their functions generally and may be directed to the purchase of lands at the discretion of the local authority. I am satisfied this levy, consistently applied and rigorously enforced, constitutes a sufficient financial incentive to property owners to eliminate dereliction. Consequently, I have no proposals to introduce a tax incentive scheme for the restoration of derelict buildings.</P>

        <P>The first meeting took place on 8 February 2005. At this meeting Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann stated that Portlaoise was the preferred site of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, from a technical and efficiency point of <Col N="1394"/>view, for a rail depot to transport beet to Mallow. Subsequent meetings took place at the proposed site of the rail depot in Portlaoise, which were attended by the area manager and senior engineer from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. In a subsequent letter to me, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann outlined that subject to certain conditions, it would be possible to run six trains per day from Portlaoise to Mallow, each with a capacity of 560 tonnes. However on the insistence of Irish Sugar and with the agreement of the Irish Farmers Association it was decided to locate the depot at Milford on the Waterford rail line.</P>

	<P>The Government is committed to a viable and sustainable rural post office network providing a range of services to meet consumer needs as set out in the programme for Government. This commitment is illustrated by the Government injection of &euro;12.7 million into the network in 2003 to facilitate modernisation measures. The Government has strongly supported An Post initiatives such as the channelling of new utility and banking services through the network. In addition, An Post has introduced the new service delivery models to improve access to and take-up of post office services.</P>
        <P>This network is geared towards customer demand in both urban and rural locations. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of the network, there is a clear recognition of the social benefits of a nationwide service. The network must be adaptable to changing circumstances and trends but the core objective of the Government and An Post continues to be the retention of access to post offices services in as many locations as possible in the manner which best meets consumer needs, whether services are provided via post office, postal agencies or the postpoint network. The main business developments in 2004 <Col N="1395"/>are the collection of Garda fines scheduled for 2005; Barclaycard credit card payments; 800,000 new bill payment transactions for the ESB; Tele 2 bill payments; and Dublin City Council commercial bin tags payments.</P>
        <P>The automated network accounts for over 95% of An Post&rsquo;s counter business. This means that the 1,000 automated offices transact 95% of counter business while 475 non-automated offices undertake 5% of business. Nevertheless, An Post is now moving to undertake a pilot project which would see ten manual post offices automated to gauge the effect on business. Furthermore, An Post will undertake a fundamental reappraisal of the post office network. The objective of this exercise is to build on the existing strengths in terms of nationwide network, strong brand recognition and high footfall and to devise a suite of products and services to meet current and future needs of post office customers. This strategy will provide the road map for future service delivery throughout the network.</P>
        <P>The level of remuneration for postmasters-postmistresses is a contractual matter between An Post and the individuals concerned. Contracts in place between An Post and members of the Irish Postmasters Union are of a commercial nature and are based in some cases on the level of transactions carried out by individual offices. The issue of social welfare payments being paid through the post office network is a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>

	<P>The authority to implement pension increases was delegated to An Post, subject to certain conditions, as this activity was considered part of the day-to-day operations of the company. This allowed the company to implement pension increases following pay increases to employees. However, decisions outside the scope of the original delegated authority still require the consent of the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance.</P>
        <P>Following a proposal from the board of An Post to amend the existing pension increase terms of An Post, in this instance, my Department and the Department of Finance undertook a review of the situation. While I fully empathise with An Post pensioners for the position they find themselves in owing to the failure of An Post management and unions to reach agreement on implementation of the recovery strategy, the wider <Col N="1396"/>overall policy issues raised by the proposal from An Post also need to be considered.</P>

	<P>Sustainable Energy Ireland, established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements initiatives on renewable energy and energy efficiency, including research, on behalf of my Department. Its renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme aims to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy technologies that are close to market and also to assess and develop potentially successful technologies. The programme provides support for renewable energy product research, development and demonstration, market demonstration of new technologies, resource studies and public good research activities.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland has through its renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme commissioned and funded the publication of two major studies in the form of atlases which between them quantify and locate the wave energy and offshore wind energy resources for Ireland. Sustainable Energy Ireland has also part-funded five demonstration-feasibility projects in the wave and offshore wind energy sectors. These include the development of an engineering specification for 1 MW wave energy pilot plant; scale modelling and wave tank testing programme; assessment of inshore Atlan<Col N="1397"/>tic wave regime; assessment of tidal and marine current energy resources in Ireland; impacts of tidal and wave energy on an all-Ireland electricity system.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland commitments in this sector amount to &euro;445,000. It is estimated expenditure in this field will be &euro;194,000 in 2005. In addition to the work being carried out by Sustainable Energy Ireland, technical and research development capabilities in ocean energy are being expanded through a new &euro;1 million contract over three years between the Marine Institute and the hydraulics and maritime research centre in UCC to develop a centre of excellence for wave energy study. The new contract will allow UCC to build up a technical support team in its wave tank facility which provides test facilities for device developers. A protocol for device developments has also been developed with a view to providing a recognised benchmark for ocean energy device standards. This is now being used by device developers and by agencies or financiers who wish to evaluate proposed devices for support.</P>
        <P>The Marine Institute has recently applied to the Department for foreshore permission to develop a site in Galway Bay which can be used to assist developers in testing large-scale devices. It is expected that this application will be published for public consultation in the coming weeks. In tandem with these developments Sustainable Energy Ireland and the Marine Institute have commissioned a study by Peter Bacon and Associates on the economic benefits of wave development and it is expected that this study will be published shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 2002 the Commission for Energy Regulation has been responsible for determination of the level of public service order granted for Bellacorrick peat station by virtue of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 (Public Service Obligations) Order (Amended) 2002, (S.I. 217 of 2002). The Commission for Energy Regulation is obliged under that order, from its commencement date of 23 May 2002, to approve the ESB&rsquo;s estimated additional costs incurred in complying with the public service obligation imposed on the ESB by my Department. It also apportions those costs, recoverable from all final customers of electricity, based on the proportion of maximum demand attributed to each category of accounts such as domestic, small-medium, and large.</P>
        <P>The aim of the order is to ensure that Ireland has reasonable self-sufficiency in electricity generation capacity by ensuring that a percentage of the State&rsquo;s generation capacity is fired on indigenous peat to help protect the environment by promoting the use of renewable energy sources.</P>
        <P>The public service obligation order requires the board, in its capacity as public electricity supplier to purchase electricity generated from peat and renewable, sustainable or alternative forms of energy. The amount of the levy, which is not a subsidy, is the excess of the board&rsquo;s allowed costs for bought-in and owned peat fired generation and alternative energy requirements over the best new entrant price for electricity. The levy includes an economic return on investment, where relevant, and any other revenue accruing to the board associated directly with peat-fired generation and alternative energy requirements generation schemes.</P>
        <P>The commission&rsquo;s decision on the public service obligation charges for 2005 &mdash; CER/04/269 &mdash; contained, for the first time, a detailed breakdown of the allocation of the levy between the peat stations, peaking capacity and alternative energy requirements-supported plant. This included &euro;1.060 million for Bellacorrick peat station for an estimated four-month operation. This was based on an installed capacity of 20 MW and 38 GW. The 2006 public service obligation calculation will reconcile any changes based on the actual operation of the plant. I am advised by the Commission for Energy Regulation, as the responsible authority in the matter, that a breakdown of the public service obligation charges for preceding years from 2002 onwards has not been published.</P>

	<P>The authority to implement pension increases was delegated to An Post, subject to certain conditions, as this activity was considered part of the day-to-day operations of the company. This allowed the company to implement pension increases following pay increases to employees. However, decisions outside the scope of the original delegated authority still require the consent of the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Finance.</P>
        <P>Following a proposal from the board of An Post to amend the company&rsquo;s existing pension increase terms in this instance, my Department and the Department of Finance undertook a review of the situation. While I fully empathise with An Post pensioners for the position in which they find themselves due to the failure of An Post management and unions to reach agreement on implementation of the recovery strategy, the wider overall policy issues raised by the proposal from An Post must also be considered.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 and 240 together.</P>
        <P>The overall management of the national fish counter programme has been primarily the responsibility of the Marine Institute which has operated directly, or by sub-contracting where necessary, to maintain the objectives of the programme.</P>
        <P>The cost of installing the counter at Mocollop on the River Blackwater came to under &euro;89,000. This funding was provided under the final tranche of the national development plan tourism angling measure in 1999. According to the Marine Institute, both this and the counter on the River Suir are hydro-acoustic counters which use echo location. They were two of four purchased in the late 1990s, to use as the basis for an experimental programme on large rivers, which pose particular difficulties with regards to directly quantifying fish runs.</P><Col N="1401"/>
        <P>These counters functioned well during testing and received clear acoustic signals. However, this type of counter requires additional technical refinement to calibrate to ensure verifiable salmon counts and to differentiate between various species of fish. This work has not yet been completed and, as a result, both of these counters are being held in storage by the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>The resistivity counter at Clondulane weir on the River Blackwater is a partial counter, providing an index of fish ascending the fish pass at the weir. According to the Marine Institute, this counter was fully functional during the latter half of 2004 and provided a total count of 8,185 ascending and 756 descending fish. However, in November 2004, a non-critical fault within the counter was detected and, as a result, a replacement counter was installed. The original unit was returned to the manufacturers for repair. No data was lost from the counter as a result of this fault.</P>
        <P>Since taking up office as Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have emphasised that I expect the regional fisheries boards and the Marine Institute to collaborate in managing the fish counter programme in the most effective and efficient way possible. In order to achieve this, I have directed the Department to review the arrangements in respect of the operational, data management and quality assurance issues for the national fish counter management programme. I expect this review to be completed so that an enhanced national management programme, including the calibration of the hydro-acoustic counters, will be established within the available resources. It will be carried out by the regional fisheries boards, in partnership with the Marine Institute, from 2005.</P>

        <Quest>if it was his Department or the Office of Public Works that expressed a preference in 2004 for a denil pass rather than a pond pass as was the plan in 2001 for the work to be undertaken on the Lacken Weir, Kilkenny; the reasoning behind the decision taken; if the cost implications were considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>While I am aware of the difficulties arising from the works undertaken on the weir on the River Nore in Kilkenny city, this project was undertaken on behalf of, and is, therefore, the responsibility of, the Office of Public Works. The OPW and the consulting engineers involved consulted the engineering division in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in Autumn 2003 on the proposed fish pass options to be facilitated in the project. Based on the data given to the Department&rsquo;s engineers by the consulting engineers on <Col N="1402"/>upstream and downstream water levels during average daily flow conditions, it was recommended that a denil pass be included in Lacken Weir rather than the previously proposed pool pass. The cost implications of the change from a pool pass to a denil pass were not considered significant in the overall cost of the works.</P>
        <P>It now transpires that the data provided by the consulting engineers in respect of these water levels was incorrect and that the downstream water level at the entrance to the constructed pass has been found to be lower than required for the normal operation of a denil pass. As a result, the fish pass installed impacted adversely at certain times on the passage of migrating salmon up river earlier this year.</P>
        <P>When this matter was discovered, both the regional fisheries board and the engineering division of the Department offered technical expertise to address the problem. The Southern Regional Fisheries Board, in co-operation with the engineers in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Office Of Public Works, has installed a temporary extension to the fish pass to ameliorate the situation and allow for the passage of fish up river.</P>
        <P>The engineering division of the Department has designed a permanent remedial scheme, expected to be put in place during low water in the summer months. The cost of the remedial works will be borne by either the Office Of Public Works or its consultant engineers.</P>

	<P>The Government and An Post share the objective of maintaining a viable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled by the network. Notwithstanding the commercial remit of An Post, the Government recognises the social benefits of maintaining the nationwide post office network. Accordingly, An Post development strategies for the network continue to take full account of these social benefits.</P>
        <P>While this is an operational matter for the board and management of An Post, and one in which I have no direct function, I have urged An Post to develop a forward looking strategy for the <Col N="1403"/>post office network. That network has been the subject of a number of studies and reviews in recent years. Many of the recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented, with particular regard to winning new business, including extra banking and new utility business.</P>
        <P>It is widely recognised the best strategy to sustain the post office network is for An Post to continue adapting to customer needs, with a view to retaining existing customers, while also developing services to attract new customers.

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003 was to establish a special fund to encourage private and public broadcasters to include additional programming of a particular character in their programme schedules. The Act provided that the 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee should be paid into the fund from 2003 onwards. At the end of April 2005, almost &euro;20.5 million had been paid into the fund. The legislation, enacted in December 2003, provided that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland would have responsibility for drawing up schemes through which the fund could be accessed. During the course of 2004, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland developed and published a draft scheme and consulted widely on it. However, before the scheme can become operational, two formal approvals are required.</P>
        <P>Under section 2(1) of the Act, the commission is required to submit a draft scheme to me for approval. The draft scheme was formally submit<Col N="1404"/>ted for approval to the Department by the commission in December 2004. EU Regulations 659/1999 and 794/2004 require Ireland to formally notify the EU Commission of all aid schemes to ensure compatibility with EU state aid and competition rules. To this end, a copy of the draft scheme was sent to the Commission in mid-January to seek their initial views. Towards the end of March, the Commission indicated that it did not see any major problems with the scheme.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, my Department proceeded to formally notify the Commission. Under the procedural regulations, the EU Commission has two months to make a decision, although this period may be extended with the consent of the member state concerned. I await the outcome of the Commission&rsquo;s deliberations.</P>

        <Quest>the reason Ireland voted at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva against a draft resolution on the question of detainees in Guantanamo Bay submitted by Cuba on 14 April 2005, despite the fact that the European Parliament adopted a resolution on 28 October 2004 calling for an impartial and independent investigation of the allegations of torture; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has, on a number of occasions, made known its concerns to the US Government regarding the treatment and status of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. It shares the view of the European Parliament that these detainees should be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Government also recognises the danger posed by terrorist networks such as al-Qaeda. Together with our EU partners, we remain committed to countering all forms of terrorism while upholding the highest standards of international human rights and humanitarian law.</P>
        <P>The draft resolution on the detainees in Guantanamo Bay, to which the Deputy refers, was tabled at the Commission on Human Rights, CHR, by the delegation from Cuba on 14 April 2005. The draft resolution was defeated in a vote taken on 21 April 2005, with all EU partners who are members of the commission, including Ireland, voting against, following full and detailed consideration of the issue. The draft resolution was opposed by 22 commission members and supported by eight.</P>
        <P>The reasons that Ireland and its partners voted against this draft resolution were given in a statement explaining our vote which was delivered by the Netherlands on behalf of the EU Presidency. This reiterated the EU&rsquo;s condemnation of all acts of terrorism, while emphasising its commitment to human rights and international humanitarian law standards for the Guantanamo detainees. The statement noted that resolutions on the protection of human rights, in the context of the fight against terrorism and of arbitrary detention, already addressed the fundamental issues underlying the Cuban draft resolution. These resolutions are strongly supported in the Commission on Human Rights by the EU.</P>
        <P>As regards a request in the draft resolution for the United States to co-operate with the special procedures of the commission, which in effect are special rapporteurs and independent experts on the issues in question, the EU statement recalled the fundamental importance it attaches to full co-<Col N="1406"/>operation by all states with these mechanisms. It noted with satisfaction that the United States has already started discussions on the modalities for a visit by special procedures to Guantanamo Bay and indicated that the EU would welcome an early visit. The EU statement also noted that some countries, including Cuba, refuse to allow such visits to their own territories and prisons and called on these countries to change their attitude. In this regard, the EU statement observed that introducing a resolution calling on the United States to act in manner which Cuba refused to do, risks damage to the work and credibility of the commission.</P>
        <P>I understand that the United States has facilitated regular visits by the international committee of the Red Cross to Guantanamo Bay. In this regard, the ICRC does not have access to prisons maintained by the Cuban Government. I would welcome an early decision by the United States Government to facilitate a visit by special procedures of the CHR to Guantanamo Bay.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>his plans regarding the recommendations made by the task force on policy regarding emigrants; the funding required to implement such recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The task force on policy regarding emigrants produced a very good report with wide-ranging conclusions, covering the full range of emigrant needs. Its recommendations were far-reaching and varied and the implementation of some of these will be, by necessity, on a phased basis over a number of years. Considerable progress has already been made, with action under way on over two thirds of its recommendations. A great many of the recommendations in the report relate to issues of continuing importance which will require ongoing action from all partners, in Government and the voluntary sector, in Ireland and abroad.</P>
        <P>Funding for emigrant services has been rising significantly in recent years. Since 1997, funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and grants from the DION fund for emigrant welfare in Britain, have increased by some 850%. I was delighted to secure &euro;8.27 million for 2005, an increase of 63% on the 2004 amount. The task force report, which provides a valuable framework for progress, stresses that help should go first and foremost to the vulnerable, the elderly and the marginalised. The increased funding being made available by my Department this year, the vast majority of which will again be directed to organisations providing frontline services to these vulnerable emigrants, will make a huge qualitative and quantitative difference. These organisations are active across the range of critical areas identified by the task force including <Col N="1407"/>pre-departure services and frontline advice and counselling to our community living abroad.</P>
        <P>The Irish abroad unit is promoting progress on initiatives which build on the task force report. Officials of the unit have had a wide range of meetings in Ireland with Departments and agencies that have a role in the provision of services to emigrants. They have also had meetings with organisations that provide frontline services to Irish people throughout Britain and the US, including with groups supporting Irish people identified by the task force as being in need of special attention and assistance, such as older emigrants, travellers and undocumented Irish people in the US. Close and ongoing exchanges of this type ensure that those in the voluntary sector engaged in the provision of services to our emigrants have an effective channel of communication to the Government. In this way, we can ensure that the needs of our emigrants continue to be accorded the highest priority and that our response is effective and is developed further in the period ahead.</P>

	<P>The allocation for 2005 provides for an increase of &euro;70 million in Government spending on official development assistance this year. This will bring total Government aid to the developing world to approximately &euro;545 million in 2005, the highest allocation in the 30-year history of the aid programme. The Government has also agreed to provide further increases of &euro;65 million in each of the years 2006 and 2007. These substantial increases mean that over the three years from 2005 to 2007, &euro;1.8 billion will be spent by Ireland on development assistance.</P>
        <P>The Government remains strongly committed to achieving the UN target for expenditure on ODA. The issue of how best to meet the target, and in what timeframe, is under ongoing review. As a matter of record the Taoiseach has not made a pledge to achieve the target of 0.7% by 2012. In fact the 2012 date is my personal preference for when we should try to achieve the target. Clearly, any decision on a new target date would be a matter for the Cabinet.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 to 258, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The economic partnership agreements, EPAs, which are to enter into force by 1 January 2008, are an integral element of the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states and the European Union.</P>
        <P>The EPAs are intended first and foremost as instruments for development to foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy, with due regard for their own political choices and their own development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication. They combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework, while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states. I cannot see this approach as constituting a dilution of African sovereignty regarding its economic future. It seems to me that it addresses the particular concern of Ireland and other member states that development and poverty reduction should be the principle objectives of the EPAs.</P>
        <P>As far as the impacts of liberalisation of trade are concerned, I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Article 37(7) of the Cotonou Agreement, which states that the negotiations on the EPAs</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">. . . shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries, and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the lib<Col N="1410"/>eralisation process. Negotiations will, therefore, be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Under European Union regulations, it is the European Commission which conducts the EPA negotiations between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of the member states. The Commission provides the Council with regular updates on the progress of the negotiations. While Ireland, like other member states, does not participate in the ongoing EPA negotiations, we are satisfied that the Commission is discharging its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and in a manner which is sensitive to the particular concerns of the ACP States. As in all trade negotiations, the EPA discussions have brought to light differences of approach between the parties in a number of areas. It is to be hoped that, as the talks progress, these divergences can be resolved in accordance with the principles and objectives underlying the negotiations. Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has primary responsibility for trade policy. An officer of that Department represents Ireland at meetings of the 133 committee, which normally meets once a month at the level of full members. An officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs also attends meetings of the 133 committee on a regular basis. Given the importance for Ireland of trade and trade relations with other countries, including those which are programme countries for Ireland&rsquo;s development cooperation programme, there is regular and on-going contact with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Food, in preparing for meetings of the 133 committee and on questions relating to trade in general. Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>All of the programme countries in Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral aid programme &mdash; Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Timor Leste &mdash; are ACP states. In each of these countries, Ireland works in close co-operation with its partner government, other donors, the private sector and civil society to ensure coherence in our approach across a range of sectors. Among the issues discussed are the impact of EU policies, including EPAs, and the wider question of integration of LDCs into the international trading system. This approach will help build the economic infrastructure in these least developed countries, LDCs, which will lead to employment generation and ultimately to long-term sus<Col N="1411"/>tainable development. The level of detail being sought by Deputy Upton in relation to employment in particular industries in sub-Saharan Africa and other related details are not available to me.</P>
        <P>In common with most other countries in the southern Africa region, South Africa is Mozambique&rsquo;s main foreign investor, and strong trade links have developed between the two countries in recent years. It would not be appropriate for me to express a view on which specific industries in Mozambique, or indeed any other third country, could sustain competition from South Africa. Part of our overall engagement with the private sector in sub-Saharan Africa involves working to create a better climate for enterprise development and economic growth and involves efforts aimed at creating a more enabling international environment and improving coherence on trade and agriculture domestically.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 263 and 264 together.</P>
        <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not track the movement of fuel prices at the pumps. The policy of the Government in respect of oil products generally is to promote competition and consumer choice. There is no price control on these products and in common with most other goods and services, price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy. It is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur and my Department encourages consumers to raise price concerns directly with retailers.</P>
        <P>While fuel may not be subject to price control, the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997, which is enforced by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, requires persons selling diesel and petrol products to specify the price per litre being charged and to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner. The order enables consumers to readily compare prices and purchase their fuel on the basis of an informed choice. If it is the case that prices for petrol are affected by agreements between petrol companies or retailers or by an abuse of a dominant position, the Competition Authority is there to enforce competition law. Any suspected infringements of competition law should be brought to the attention of the Competition Authority.</P>

	<P>The National Minimum Wage Act came into effect in April 2000. Prior to the introduction of the legislation, the national minimum wage commission was appointed by the Government to advise on the introduction of a national minimum wage. The commission examined a number of issues including the social implications of a national minimum wage and the determination, implementation and enforcement of a minimum wage. It recommended that employees under the age of 18 should be entitled to 70% of the national minimum wage. This percentage was recommended to strike a balance between ensuring that young employees are not exploited and ensuring that the rate of pay does not encourage students to leave full-time education.</P>
        <P>This recommendation was endorsed by the interdepartmental group on implementation of a national minimum wage which felt that a reduced rate for those under 18 raised important issues for national education and employment policies and required particularly careful consideration. In its report it stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The group is of the view that, having regard to the fact that there will always be a certain group of young people entering full time employment before the age of 18, that this group is among the most vulnerable in society and there is need to cater for them in the context of a national minimum wage. Nevertheless, it is also clear that the introduction of a national minimum wage has two possible effects on this group &mdash; a possible increase in the supply of such workers attracted by the minimum wage rate to leave education earlier than they would otherwise have done, and a possible reduction in demand for such workers by raising their price to beyond a level which employers were prepared to pay.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The sub-minimum rate for those under 18 was therefore recommended by the national minimum wage commission, endorsed by the interdepartmental group on the implementation of a national minimum wage and was subsequently implemented in the minimum wage legislation.</P>

	<P el="0">Community employment, CE, is intended as a labour market work experience programme of pre-determined duration. Participants who leave the programme are replaced on an ongoing basis and thus redundancy does not <Col N="1415"/>arise in such cases because the programme position continues to exist. In circumstances where a project closes down, the participants, with their agreement, may transfer to another F&Aacute;S-sponsored project to complete their term on CE.</P>
        <P>Redundancy is, in the first instance, an issue between the employer and employee. In the exceptional circumstances where redundancy arises, due to the closing down of the project, CE participants may claim statutory redundancy provided they have worked continuously for at least 104 weeks with the same employer. Such claims are made directly to the employer who sponsors the project in the first instance. I am informed by F&Aacute;S that during the years 2002 and 2003 the number of participants who were paid statutory redundancy was in the order of 120. The figure for 2004 is estimated by F&Aacute;S at being substantially less, particularly as the overall level of places provided on CE increased by approximately 2000 during that year. Finally, I regret the delay in providing the Deputy with the information.</P>

	<P>IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland, including its regions and areas. Ultimately, decisions regarding where to locate, including what areas or sites to visit as potential locations are taken by investors. In 2004 two companies visited the Kerry region, one an ICT company which visited Killarney and Tralee and the other an international services company that visited Killarney. To date, neither company has decided to locate in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition to targeting potential new projects, IDA Ireland is also working with its existing base of companies in the region with a view to supporting such companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities, which strengthen their presence in the region. During 2004, three expansion projects were announced in Kerry, the details of which are as follows. Dollinger (Ireland) Limited is to be the global centre for production of its compressed air products range. This &euro;1.1 million investment will create over 70 new jobs over the next four years and has resulted in Dollinger re-locating to larger premises. Liebherr Container Cranes Limited is to recruit six highly skilled R&amp;D personnel for a new R&amp;D specialised team. The team, which will <Col N="1416"/>be of strategic importance to the parent company and will enhance the facility&rsquo;s role as the centre of control for Liebherr&rsquo;s container crane products, will develop products from concept through to product launch. In addition, any intellectual property developed will be the property of the Irish company. Fujisawa, one of the world&rsquo;s top 30 pharmaceutical companies, announced that it had invested &euro;17 million in the expansion of its Irish operation in County Kerry. The company has a total employment of 280 people and has constructed a 27,000 sq. ft. extension to provide additional production space for the new operation.</P>
        <P>At the end of 2004 there were 2,022 people in permanent employment in 21 IDA-supported companies in County Kerry. I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland will bear fruit in terms of maximising sustainable investment and jobs for the people of Kerry.</P>

	<P>Shannon Development is the agency responsible for regional economic development in the mid-west region. Plans for the factory site in question are an operational issue for the company and not one in which I have any direct function. However, I understand that Shannon Development have been in contact with the consortium of ex-workers and the liquidator.</P>
        <P>It is of the utmost importance that all efforts be made to ensure that the workers who became unemployed through the liquidation of Fitzpack Ltd. are assisted in finding new employment in the region. Shannon Development, as the regional economic development agency, has a role to play in this regard. However, it also has to observe other rules and requirements, such as public procurement requirements and act in an open and transparent manner, when it is dealing in State assets, which is essential in the good operation of any State body. In the circumstances, I have no plans to appoint a facilitator.</P>
        <P>It is understood from Shannon Development that it is proceeding with the process of placing the factory building and land within its curtilage on the open market. Consulting engineers have been engaged to advise on what portion of the lands in the vicinity of the building are required in order to ensure that adequate access and services are available for use of the factory. The final decision on the method of disposal to be used &mdash; public auction, public tender or private treaty &mdash; will be made on the advice of the professional property agents who will be appointed to handle the marketing and sale of the premises. The marketing process is likely to commence shortly and continue through June.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 to 274, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>EPAs are, first and foremost, instruments for development that will foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP States into the world economy. Substantive negotiations are currently underway between the EU and ACP states in this regard. As trade is a Union competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP States on behalf of member states on the basis of an agreed mandate. The Commission provides the Council with updates on the progress of the negotiations.</P>
        <P>I have read with interest the recent position paper that sets out the UK view on how best the commitment to put development at the heart of the EPA negotiations can be best delivered. I agree with the basic thrust of an approach to the EPAs which ensure that the needs and concerns of developing countries are taken adequately into consideration during the substantive phase of these negotiations. Indeed, more recently, in the context of the further progression of EPA negotiations, Commissioner Mandelson has indicated that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review, with a new review mechanism to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations that the development dimension is put first. I fully support this approach by the commissioner.</P><Col N="1419"/>
        <P>Ireland is actively following the developments in the EPA negotiations process and will continue to do so. In so far as the discussions within the EU Council, including the Article 133 committee, are concerned, Ireland will have full regard to the content of the UK paper. In all of these discussions, we will be insisting that the Commission discharge its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and in a manner which is sensitive to the particular concerns of ACP states.</P>

        <P>Some of the information regarding issues raised by the Deputy in his questions is available on the PIAB&rsquo;s website at <i>www.piab.ie</i> and is updated regularly. In this regard, the latest figures available on the number of applications to PIAB for assessment of quantum indicate that, at 21 April 2005, 19,099 calls had been received, 898,206 website hits had been recorded and a total of 7,196 applications for assessment had been made. These are broken down as follows: 1,879 employer liability applications; 2,204 public liability applications; and 3,113 motor accident applications.</P>
        <P>However, many details requested by the Deputy relate to operational matters for which the chief executive officer of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board holds responsibility. Further information is, however, currently being collated by the PIAB and will be made available to me shortly. I will ask the PIAB to make this information available to the Deputy. I also understand that the PIAB will be releasing this information publicly.</P>
        <P>Regarding the funding of the PIAB, the Exchequer has provided funds of &euro;5.5 million for the set up and running costs of the PIAB in the years 2003 and 2004. A further &euro;2.5 million has been provided for in the Department&rsquo;s 2005 Estimates. The PIAB is expected to be self funding by year end 2005.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the statutory obligations relating to all applications received by the PIAB have been met. My understanding is that data relating to the first 25 assessments will be released to the public shortly. These awards have been made within nine months of the relevant respondents consenting to assessment, as required by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.</P>
        <P>With regard to volumes, the PIAB expects to assess in the region of 10,000 cases per annum when fully operational. The PIAB started handling all personal injury cases in the country from 22 July 2004. As it approaches its first anniversary next July, it will be on target with current applications standing at 7,196. This is all the more significant bearing in mind that the natural flow of claims into the PIAB was slowed by the acceleration of approximately 16,000 cases into the litigation route prior to the PIAB commencing oper<Col N="1422"/>ations. I am very pleased with the operation of the PIAB to date.</P>

	<P>Rent supplements are provided through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Rent supplements are subject to a means test and are normally calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution &mdash; currently &euro;13 per week &mdash; which a recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.</P>
        <P>In addition to this minimum weekly contribution, each recipient is also required to contribute any additional assessable means he or she has over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate towards his or her rent. Up to &euro;60 of additional weekly income is disregarded in the rent supplement means test in respect of participation in approved training courses, to ensure that a person gains overall as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</P>
        <P>The Dublin and mid-Leinster area of the executive has advised that the amount of rent supplement in payment to the person concerned was reduced to take account of an increase in the level of her assessable household income. In addition to her one-parent family payment, the person concerned is now in receipt of a weekly training allowance of &euro;148.80. Taking account of this additional income, and allowing the appropriate &euro;60 disregard, the person concerned is in receipt of the correct amount of rent supplement for her circumstances. Her income before rent supplement is &euro;316.90 per week and she is also in receipt of an additional &euro;60.70 per week in rent supplement.</P>

	<P>The group concerned applied to the family support agency, FSA, for inclusion in the family and community services resource centre, <Col N="1423"/>FRC, programme in June 2004. FSA officials visited this group in March 2005. A report on the meeting was prepared which included an overall assessment of the application. This will be submitted for consideration to a committee established by the board of the agency, and with expertise in this area, which has responsibility for assessing applications for inclusion in the programme. The next meeting of this committee is scheduled to take place on 7 June 2005 and this group&rsquo;s application will be considered at that meeting.</P>
        <P>The committee&rsquo;s evaluation will then be subject to ratification by the FSA board, which, if positive, will then be submitted for my approval. At this stage the board will notify the group of the outcome.</P>

	<P>Family resource centres are funded under the family and community services resource centre, FRC, programme which is administered by the family support agency. The aim of the FRC programme is essentially to help combat disadvantage by improving the function of the family unit. The emphasis in the centres is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned. Family resource centres involve people from marginalised and most vulnerable groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.</P>
        <P>In 2005, I have made almost &euro;25 million available to the family support agency to fulfil its strategic priorities. These include the expansion of the national family mediation service, the continuing development of the scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services and the ongoing promotion and development of the family and community services resource centre, FRC, programme, to which I specifically allocated over &euro;10.5 million for the current year.</P>
        <P>This amount includes a specific allocation of &euro;200,000 toward capital grants to projects in the programme. This is the first year that a grant for capital funding has been allocated to the programme. Annual core funding to projects in the programme includes an amount towards the rental costs of premises.</P>
        <P>There are currently 77 family resource centres in receipt of core funding, with another 12 centres to be brought into the programme during this year. I fully expect that the target of 100 centres by the end of 2006, set under the national <Col N="1424"/>development plan, will be achieved by the family support agency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>In August 1986, Craig Gardner Consultants were commissioned to examine the major payment systems in my Department with a view to establishing where they were most at risk and to advise on cost effective measures to keep these risks to a minimum. The consultants submitted three reports containing a number of recommendations covering operational and organisational arrangements and about protecting the schemes from abuse. The final report was submitted in November 1987.</P>
        <P>The main recommendations covered internal working arrangements and the manner in which services were delivered. In particular, the consultants recommended a greater emphasis on local service and control, the examination of identity issues and the introduction of new payment methods. Since then the Department has gone through a major reorganisation which has allowed for a more focused approach to fraud and control. This reorganisation included the establishment in 1991 of a regional structure, a dedicated control division in 1992 and the setting up of separate control units in each of my Department&rsquo;s scheme sections. There has also been an increase in the number of staff involved in control work generally.</P>
        <P>Throughout the 1980s the rapid introduction of information technology facilitated the move from manual to computerised systems to support the administration of the Department&rsquo;s schemes and the elimination of cash payments in local offices. This allowed my Department to take a more focused, co-ordinated and effective approach to control of schemes by enabling data from a variety of sources to be cross checked and potential irregularities isolated and investigated.</P>
        <P>The services operated by the network of local and branch offices have expanded significantly since the Craig Gardner reports. Claims for pre-retirement allowance and farm assist are processed locally and currently the one-parent family payment scheme is being localised. A facility is also available to register and to certify ongoing entitlement to claims for disability benefit. In addition, all applications for personal public <Col N="1425"/>services numbers, formerly the revenue and social insurance number, are processed through the network of local and branch offices. A comprehensive information service is also provided in these locations for customers.</P>
        <P>There has also been an increased emphasis on liaison and co-operation with external organisations to support my Department&rsquo;s control activities. In this context, my Department has put an extensive legal framework in place to support the sharing of data with other prescribed organisations for the purposes of controlling the entitlement and payment of benefits. Information is obtained and acted upon on an ongoing basis from a range of organisations including the Revenue Commissioners, F&Aacute;S, the Health Service Executive and other Government Departments. For example, commencement of employment data received from the Revenue Commissioners and details of full-time registered day time students from third level institutions is matched against social welfare databases to identify cases where there is a possible overlap between the employment or college attendance period and the social welfare payment. Cases identified with open claims are referred to the relevant areas for investigation.</P>
        <P>In addition, there is regular contact between my Department and the social security authorities in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. The level of co-operation between my Department and all these organisations is kept under continuous review with a view to enhancing it where appropriate.</P>
        <P>Another initiative involved the setting up of a joint investigation unit, comprising inspectors from my Department&rsquo;s special investigation unit and the Revenue Commissioners, to use their combined legal powers to ensure that employers comply with their PAYE-PRSI obligations and to identify customers working and claiming benefit. My Department&rsquo;s control strategy, published in 2003, is based on a four pronged approach to the control of schemes, namely, prevention of fraud and error at the initial claim stage, early detection through effective review of claims in payment, measures to deter fraud and the pursuit and recovery of overpayments.</P>
        <P>The introduction of systematic risk analysis of major schemes is a key element of the approach to tackling fraud and abuse. Furthermore, surveys of schemes are undertaken to establish baseline levels of fraud and abuse and my Department is committed to undertaking at least two such surveys annually. All cases of fraud are considered for prosecution. A policy on prosecution was published in early 2003 which has resulted in increased numbers of cases being prosecuted. In 2004, 503 cases were submitted for prosecution compared with 405 and 245 respectively in respect of the previous two years.</P>

	<P>The following anti-fraud initiatives were enacted in the last ten years. Section 22 of the Social Welfare Act 1998 amended the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 to provide that persons who fail to provide information to the Minister about persons or class of persons, as may be prescribed, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
        <P>Section 26 of the Social Welfare Act 1999 amended section 212 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 by conferring more specific powers on social welfare inspectors regarding inspection and taking copies of records found on inspection of premises, removing and retaining such records and securing records for later inspection. Social welfare inspectors were also given power to summon the occupier of the premises, or an employer on the premises, to attend at an office of the Minister or other premises for clarification of any questions consequent on inspection, by notice in writing. A social welfare inspector may be accompanied by Garda when performing any power conferred under that section and, if accompanied by Garda, may stop any vehicle suspected to be used in course of employment or self employment and may question and make inquiries of any person in the vehicle or require him to produce any employment records in his possession.</P>
        <P>Section 28 of the Social Welfare Act 1999 amended section 224 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 to allow a prosecution for a summary offence under that Act to be brought at the suit of the Health Service Executive and the Collector General. It also provided that civil proceedings under that Act may be taken by or against the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
        <P>Section 17 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005 amended section 224(<i>a</i>) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 to extend the period under which a prosecution may be taken from six to 18 months, commencing on the date on which evidence sufficient to justify the institution of that prosecution comes into the possession of the Minister. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Control Provisions) Regulations 1997, S.I. No. 155 of 1997, consolidated existing regulations and introduced an extension of the notification of commencement of employment requirement to the meat processing industry. They also extended to PLC students the requirements applying to some institutes of higher education to provide information to the Minister at the start of each academic year in respect of each person registered as a student at that institution.</P>
        <P>The amendment contained in section 22 of the 1998 Act was used to extend these provisions to private colleges or schools which do not receive funding or validation from the Department of Education and Science or other bodies. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Control <Col N="1427"/>Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations 1998, S.I. No. 468 of 1998, refer. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Control Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations 2001, S.I. No. 327 of 2001, extended the obligation on employers to maintain on-site records to the construction industry. These measures were designed to facilitate the detection of potential fraud and abuse.</P>
        <P>While the specific nature of the fraud or abuse detected is recorded in all cases in terms of the outcome of investigations, records are not maintained in such a way as to provide the information sought by the Deputy.</P>

        <Quest> the number of employers who have been compelled to repay benefits, pensions, allowances, assistance or supplements, in accordance with section 219 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, fraudulently obtained as a result of an employer&rsquo;s failure to maintain records as required by the Act, each year since the provision was enacted; and the amount repaid in each year.</Quest>

	<P>The aim of my Department&rsquo;s control policy is to prevent fraud and abuse. A key aspect of control policy is deterrence and effective debt management is seen as an integral part of the deterrent approach.</P>
        <P>Use of section 219 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1993 as a method of overpayment recovery, in appropriate cases, is one element of my Department&rsquo;s debt management policy. Under this section, where an employer fails to maintain proper and complete wage records detailing the employment details of it&rsquo;s employees and where, due to that failure, an employee receives a benefit, pension, assistance or allowance payment to which he/she would not otherwise be entitled, the employer is liable to repay the full amount of that benefit, pension, assistance or allowance.</P>
        <P>Based on available records, the number of employers in respect of whom overpayments have been assessed under section 219 and the amounts paid from 1999 onwards are detailed in the table. Details of payments made by employers under section 219 prior to this are not available. </P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of a public service card was one of a number of objectives set for the Reach agency at the launch of the Reach initiative in 1999 and 2000. The objectives included the establishment and use of the personal public service, PPS, number as the common customer identifier and the development and acceptance of the public service card as the citizen&rsquo;s key to services.</P>
        <P>Reach pursued the public service card objective through a programme of research and analysis of international best practice in the use of cards and, following preliminary consultations with Government Departments, developed a rationale for furthering the development and deployment of a public service card in the Irish public services context. The rationale provided foundation material for the Government approval in 2004 to develop the current SAFE initiative, which is jointly managed by client identity services in my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>During this period, the Reach agency was also mandated to develop and implement the public services broker. The refocusing of Reach&rsquo;s priorities in that time facilitated the development of the complex and significant broker project, the first phase of which is to go live shortly. Reach continues to work with client identity services to build and extend identity services to support access to services through the public services broker.</P>
        <P>Reach has participated in the steering group established to progress the SAFE initiative, which is developing a set of business principles to form a standard for a public service card. The SAFE initiative has recently completed the initial phase of its work and proposals will shortly be prepared for Government relating to this which will also address future phases of work, including convergence issues and a communication and consultation programme.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 to 292, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In 1991, responsibility for the allocation of RSI numbers, which were subsequently renamed personal public service, PPS, numbers in 1998, transferred from the Revenue Commissioners to my Department. In 1991, it was proposed by my Department and agreed with the Department of Finance to replace the cardboard registration card with the more modern social services card. This card, which shows the client&rsquo;s name and PPS number on the front, has a magnetic stripe on the back which contains the PPS number, sex and date of birth of the client.</P>
        <P>The number of social services cards issued in each year since 1992 is set out in appendix 1. On its introduction it was intended that the card would be used as a permanent and durable record of a person&rsquo;s PPS number. The card was also to provide customers with secure access to electronic information transfer, EIT, payments via the post office network. These are the only uses to which the card has been put since its introduction. The social services card does not formally support any other uses.</P>
        <P>The number of customers using the social services card for the EIT method of payment is set out in appendix 2. The yearly numbers of EIT transactions made using the social services card is set out in appendix 3. No discussions with other Government Departments have taken place specifically on the types of usage that might be appropriate for the social services card since 1992. However, discussions have taken place on the more substantive issue of an integrated approach to public service delivery, including the role a card could play as a means to facilitate this integration.</P>
        <P>Work has also taken place on the development of the legal and operational basis for the unique identifier, the PPS number, and on the progression of the initiative in the context of the e-government modernisation programme. In June 2004, the Government approved proposals for the development of a framework for public service cards using the personal public service, PPS, number as a unique identifier. An interdepartmental group is currently working on developing this framework, which is known as SAFE &mdash; standard authentication framework environment. The report on its first phase of work is currently being prepared. </P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 and 294 together.</P>
        <P>Current payment options for old age pensions include payment at post offices by means of a pension order book and direct payment to customers&rsquo; bank, building society or post office savings accounts. My objective is to ensure that a range of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually <Col N="1431"/>improved by providing access to the wide range of payment options and new services and facilities now available.</P>
        <P>I recently announced a comprehensive review of my Department&rsquo;s payment systems. The purpose of the review is to identify a system for the future that will respond most effectively to the individual needs of customers and deliver a service that is flexible and cost effective. This review will have regard to current trends and offerings in the financial services sector and the rapid advances in card based technologies. It will also take account of Government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The increased use of electronic systems and card based technologies opens up possibilities for improved service and greater efficiency in payment delivery generally in the future. I recently met with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is the Minister responsible for An Post, to discuss these possibilities and their future role in payment delivery in post offices.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> his plans to reform the rent allowance system, in particular contacts with other Government Departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to assist an eligible person who is unable to provide for his or her accommodation costs from his or her own resources and who does not have accommodation available from any other source.</P>
        <P>A significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements on a long-term basis over the years. In July 2004, the Government announced a new initiative to meet the long-term housing needs of rent supplement recipients. The new system will see local authorities assume responsibility for meeting long-term housing assistance needs, including the needs of those people on rent supplements for 18 months or longer. These needs will be met through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public private partnership type rental accommodation scheme. A total of &euro;19 million has been transferred from my Department&rsquo;s Vote to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Vote this year to help finance this initiative.</P>
        <P>The new arrangements are currently being implemented in seven local authorities. My Department and the Health Service Executive are actively assisting the local authorities and the <Col N="1432"/>Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this process. That Department has appointed programme managers to assist the lead authorities with the implementation of the new arrangements. Thereafter, these managers will be available to support other authorities during the implementation period. Regional and local implementation groups in the seven lead authority areas have been established to ensure effective ongoing liaison and co-operation locally between housing authorities, Health Service Executive areas and other agencies.</P>
        <P>It is expected that the lead local authorities will transfer the first eligible rent supplement recipients to the rental accommodation scheme in May 2005. The new arrangements will be initiated in all local authority areas by the end of 2005. Almost 30,000 households who have been in receipt of a rent supplement payment for 18 months or more and are likely to be supported under the new rental assistance arrangements in due course.</P>
        <P>The aim of the new system is to minimise ongoing dependence on rent supplement. The objective is to progress to a situation where suitable long-term accommodation is available for all who need it and where the rent supplement scheme is not necessary other than for short-term support. This is planned to be achieved within a period of three years from commencement of the new arrangements in each local authority and, in any event, no later than September 2008. Overall, the new rental assistance arrangements represent a major step forward in supporting people with long-term housing needs. All the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to make the system work successfully.</P>
        <P>The supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement scheme will continue to provide short-term income support for eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources. The role, efficiency and effectiveness of this supplement is being considered in the context of a comprehensive evaluation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme being carried out by my Department this year as part of its programme of expenditure reviews.</P>

        <Quest> if he will consider increasing the fuel allowance from &euro;9 to a more realistic amount.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their extra heating needs during the winter season. It is not intended to meet the full cost of fuel. A fuel allowance of &euro;9 per week, &euro;12.90 in designated urban smokeless fuel zones, is payable to eligible households <Col N="1433"/>for a 29-week period from end-September to mid-April each year.</P>
        <P>Significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. These rates are payable throughout the year and are intended to cover basic living costs, including cooking and heating, supplemented where applicable by the fuel allowance during the winter heating season. Many households also qualify for electricity or gas allowances throughout the year under the social welfare household benefits scheme. In addition, a heating supplement may be payable through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in cases of individual special need.</P>
        <P>I have no plans at present to increase the rate of fuel allowance. Any such change to the scheme would have to be considered in a budget context and in the light of other priorities.</P>

	<P>Under the treatment benefit scheme administered by my Department, persons insured under the Social Welfare Acts and their dependent spouses can avail of benefit in respect of a certain range of dental, optical and aural services subject to satisfying certain contribution conditions. To qualify for medical appliance benefit an insured person who reached 66 years before July 1992 is required to have: 208 weeks reckonable PRSI contributions paid since entry into insurable employment and 39 weeks reckonable insurance contributions paid or credited in either of the two complete tax years before reaching the age of 66 years. If the person does not qualify at age 66 years their contribution record is examined to check if they satisfied the contribution conditions at age 60.</P>
        <P>The relevant tax years for the person concerned are 1986-87 and 1987-88. According to the records of my Department, he satisfies the first condition. He does not satisfy the second condition as he has no contributions paid or credited during those tax years. The relevant tax year for the person concerned at age 60 is the 1981-82 tax year. He has no contributions paid during that year. He does not, therefore, qualify for medical appliance benefit.</P>
        <P>If the person concerned is the holder of a medical card he may be entitled to some assistance towards his costs under the scheme administered by the Health Service  Executive. Inquiries in this regard should be made at his local health services centre.</P>

	<P>My Department issues over half a million cheques every month and, as a general rule, there are no problems regarding their encashment. Occasionally, people experience difficulty in cashing their cheques, mainly because of inadequate identification. Such problems were resolved on a case by case basis.</P>
        <P>Cheques are but one of a range of payment methods offered to customers and would account for about 10% of total payments issued by my Department. While precise statistics are not available, it is estimated that about one third of social welfare customers in receipt of cheque payments cash them at retail outlets without any difficulty. The cashing of cheques by retail outlets is a matter between the customer and the retailer and it would not be appropriate for me to interfere in this relationship.</P>
        <P>Cheques issued by my Department are drawn on the Bank of Ireland and may be cashed at any bank branch on production of necessary identification. In addition, Bank of Ireland has an agreement with An Post whereby social welfare cheques may be cashed at any post office subject to satisfactory proof of identity. If a social welfare customer experiences any difficulties in cashing their cheques, they should bring the matter to the attention of my Department which will ensure that alternative payment arrangements are offered to them. These arrangements include payment at the customer&rsquo;s local post office or by direct payment into the customer&rsquo;s bank or building society account.</P>

	<P>Rent supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive. Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>In general, people in full-time education are excluded from receiving assistance, including rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. However, there is statutory provision for continued payment of rent supplement to eligible people, generally over age 21 years, who wish to resume full-time education in approved courses through the back to education allowance or VTOS schemes, subject to satisfying <Col N="1435"/>the other standard conditions of the rent supplement scheme.</P>
        <P>The Dublin and mid-Leinster area of the executive has advised that it became aware that the person concerned is a full-time student in the course of a routine review of her entitlements. As she is not participating in either the back to education allowance or VTOS schemes, she does not satisfy the statutory conditions for retention of rent supplement.</P>

	<P>The centre concerned is one of a number of organisations which are funded under my Department&rsquo;s scheme of grants for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights. Since its establishment in 1975, the centre has been funded exclusively by State agencies, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with my Department taking over direct funding in 1995. Annual funding has increased progressively over the years and my Department provided &euro;215,000 to the centre in 2004.</P>
        <P>I am fully cognisant of the valuable role which a community-based legal advice service such as the centre concerned can play in the delivery of <Col N="1436"/>a comprehensive and cost-effective legal advice service for citizens. However, I am satisfied that my Department is not, in the long term, the most appropriate source of funding for this service having regard to the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility for funding legal aid services. Social welfare queries dealt with by the centre in 2004 represented less than 5% of its annual business.</P>
        <P>I have, therefore, written to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, regarding future funding of the centre as an integral part of its legal aid services and I will be following this up with him as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I am increasing their funding for 2005 to &euro;360,000. This will allow for a breathing space between now and the end of the year during which a solid, long-term strategy can be assembled that will ensure the centre can continue its work into the future.</P>

	<P>Significant investment has been made to date under the national development plan, NDP, in acquiring new buses for Dublin Bus. In addition, significant Exchequer funding has been provided for a new depot for these buses. As a consequence, the capacity of the fleet has been increased by nearly 25% since 1999 and the company is now carrying approximately 150 million passengers per annum. Some 418 buses have been purchased by Dublin Bus since 1999 with the assistance of Exchequer and EU funds.</P>
        <P>In addition to the significant Exchequer investment in Dublin Bus in recent years, significant investment has been made under the NDP in other public transport modes such as Luas, the Maynooth and Kildare suburban rail lines and the DART.

	<P>The Government consultation paper, New Institutional Arrangements for Land-Use and Transport in the Greater Dublin Area, was published jointly by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise in April, 2001. The paper proposed the establishment of a new strategic land use and transportation planning authority for the greater Dublin area. Developments since the publication of this consultation document have caused a review of the proposals.</P>
        <P>The national spatial strategy was published in December 2002 and, arising from that strategy, the regional authorities have finalised regional planning guidelines under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000. These provide effective regional land use strategies consistent with the national spatial strategy. The Dublin and mid-east regional authorities have collaborated to produce a single set of guidelines for the greater Dublin area which were published on 8 July last. These guidelines recommend a number of specific actions required for the further development of transport in the region. The guidelines also recommend a number of policy principles that are to be pursued in that regard.</P>
        <P>The relevant agencies investing in transport in the region are now developing their plans in the light of the guidelines. In particular, the guidelines provide an important guidance to the Dublin Transportation Office in its input into all development plans and planning applications in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>In the light of the developments in the intervening period, I am of the view that the establishment of a greater Dublin land use transportation authority is not now a priority in seeking to improve the transport system for Dublin. However, I intend to keep this issue under review as we proceed with the preparation of the proposed ten year transport investment plan.</P>

        <P>My Department is providing funding of approximately &euro;1.2 million towards the company&rsquo;s fleet replacement programme for 2005. Given the demands on the multi-annual capital budget negotiated by my Department with the Department of Finance, prudent management requires that my Department is satisfied regarding the utilisation of existing resources before considering additional funding. In this context, the management of Dublin Bus is currently examining ways of maximising the utilisation of the bus fleet, in light of the significant investment made to date under the NDP in other modes such as Luas, suburban rail and the DART upgrade. I await the outcome of this review.</P>
        <P>A key element in improving public transport in the Dublin area has been the provision of quality bus corridors, QBCs. The QBCs are making a significant contribution in terms of greater patronage and increased bus speeds. So far, there are nine QBCs in operation in the Dublin area, Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, north Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown.</P>
        <P>It is proposed to complete a number of quality bus corridor projects in the course of 2005, accounting for a total of about 40 km in length. The sections of new QBCs that will be completed in 2005 depend on the outcome of public consultation and tendering processes. Funding for the QBCs is provided through the Department of Transport&rsquo;s traffic management grants scheme which is administered by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO. I have allocated &euro;40 million to the traffic management grants scheme for 2005 and I understand that the DTO steering committee has decided to allocate 85% of this amount <Col N="1441"/>for the design, development and implementation of bus priority schemes in 2005.</P>
        <P>Cycle facilities will be developed in conjunction with the implementation of bus priority schemes.

	<P>Developments at EU level will result in new heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, having to comply with higher standards in regard to the fields of vision of drivers. EU Directive 2003/97/EC, which harmonises the rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision, including mirrors and camera-monitors, on motor <Col N="1442"/>vehicles and of vehicles equipped with these devices, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for an extension of the field of vision so as to address the issue of blind spots. These enhanced requirements should lead to a reduction in fatalities and serious injuries involving pedestrians and cyclists due to the driver&rsquo;s inadequate field of vision. The directive requires all new HGVs entering into service from 26 January 2007 to meet the revised standards for field of vision set in the directive.</P>
        <P>The directive was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Entry into Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, which were made on 20 December 2004. Subject to practical engineering constraints and the agreement of the European Commission, it is my intention to require existing vehicles of the types covered by the directive to be retrofitted with the necessary mirrors and/or cameras and monitors.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place should be aware of the statutory requirements in road traffic law to drive with reasonable consideration for other persons and with due care and attention.</P>

        <Quest>the plans he has to ensure that penalty points are endorsed on the licence record of a person; if it is acceptable that it may take several months for the penalty to be recorded; if this is fair to the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Road Traffic Act 2002, which provides the legislative basis for the introduction and operation of the penalty points system, contains specific provisions governing application of such points on the licence record of an individual. Section 5 of the Act provides that where penalty points are to be endorsed on a record, a notification of that endorsement must be issued to the licence holder involved. The notice sets out in particular the basis for the endorsement of the points. Section 7 of the Act provides that, save in very limited and quite specific instances, the operative date for penalty points is 28 days from the date of the notice issued under section 5. This date is referred to in the Act as the appropriate date.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the 2002 Act, in regard to the appropriate date, recognise that as a result of the endorsement of penalty points a person may face the application of an automatic disqualification from driving. Section 3 of the Act establishes that where a person accumulates at least 12 penalty points, he or she will be disqualified for a period of six months. If penalty points were to be applied from the date of the commission of the offence in the first instance or from the date of the payment of the fixed charge, a person could be faced with the prospect that they would have already been disqualified in advance of any notification being sent to that effect. This would in turn create the <Col N="1443"/>situation that a person would be open to a charge of driving when disqualified where they had driven in the period between the commission of the original offence or the payment of the charge and the date of the notice.</P>
        <P>The penalty points system has been designed and structured to ensure that any person who is accused of the commission of a penalty point offence is afforded a significant time period to chose whether or not to allow the matter to proceed to court. Save in respect of eight of the 70 offences determined to be penalty point offences in the Act, the option of the payment of a fixed charge is afforded to the accused person. A person presented with a fixed charge notice is given a period of 56 days in which to make such a payment before the certainty of a court summons is applied. There is, therefore, a potentially significant period made available to a person to make a decision and all of the time lapses relating to the system that are established in the Act are set out in the fixed charge notice issued in respect of the alleged commission of the offence.</P>

	<P>I am more than willing to meet delegations concerning the Ulster Canal or any other issue to which a meeting can make a meaningful contribution. However, in view of the current care and maintenance mode in which the North-South bodies are operating, there is currently no possibility of advancing consideration of the possibility of proceeding with work on the Ulster canal. That being so, I do not feel that a meeting at this time would serve any useful purpose. However, I wrote to Monaghan County Council on the 24 March, 2005, stating that I am willing to review this decision on receipt of a clear perspective from it as to the precise purpose such a meeting would serve.</P>

	<P>The proposed redefinition of disadvantaged areas is one element of a EU Commission proposal on support for rural development in the 2007-13 period. The proposed redefinition responds to the European Court of Auditors&rsquo; criticism, endorsed by the European Parliament, of the current system. The suggested new methodology is based on natural conditions, notably soil and climatic factors. The socio-economic criteria that were taken into account to designate the current eligible areas would no longer apply.</P>
        <P>At meetings of the Council of Ministers, I stressed that this is an extremely important and sensitive issue. Other member states have adopted a similar position. The Commission has accepted that the proposal presents difficulties for member states. However, a revised compromise text circulated by the Presidency on 27 April did not propose any changes to the original text in so far as the disadvantaged areas are concerned. I will continue to seek a solution that is equitable and in Ireland&rsquo;s interests.</P>

	<P>I received the committee&rsquo;s report formally on 7 April and my officials are currently examining it. This report arises from an investigation by the committee of a complaint by a group representing retired farmers. Department officials provided a comprehensive formal written response to the complaint and attended a meeting of the committee in July 2003 to answer questions from members. The report covers a range of issues, including taxation, which is outside my <Col N="1448"/>remit. I will address the issues shortly in a formal response to the committee.</P>
        <P>I am naturally anxious that the early retirement scheme delivers maximum benefits to retired farmers. However this is an EU-funded scheme and I am constrained by the regulations under which it was introduced. I have to point out that the same group of retired farmers made an identical complaint to the European Commission, which did not uphold it. The Commission concluded, in other words, that my Department is administering the scheme correctly and in accordance with the governing EU regulations.</P>
        <P>The Department has recently conducted an expenditure review of the current early retirement scheme and copies were laid before the House on 13 April. The expenditure review process was established by the Department of Finance in 1997 in the context of the strategic management initiative. The purpose of the review of the early retirement scheme is to analyse systematically whether it is meeting its objectives and to inform future decisions regarding priorities on expenditure programmes. The Department&rsquo;s review includes a number of conclusions and recommendations that will help to inform my response to the report of the joint committee.</P>

	<P>Under the new single payment scheme, farmers receiving direct aid are required to respect the various statutory management requirements set down in EU legislation on the environment, food safety, animal health, and welfare, and plant health and to maintain the farm in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC. There will also be an obligation on the member state to ensure that there is no significant reduction in the amount of land under permanent pasture by reference to the total area under permanent pasture in 2003. These requirements are termed &ldquo;cross compliance&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The EU directives and regulations referred to in cross compliance are in place for many years. Producers are generally familiar with them and are complying with the standards set in implementing them in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Department prepared a consultative document on cross compliance in October, 2004 and invited views from interested organisations. Department officials met with the main farming organisations in December to discuss their submissions and these discussions have continued more recently in the context of the review of the protocol on direct payments.</P>
        <P>An information booklet on cross compliance has been issued to all farmers and sets out its principle features both in terms of the standards that must be met by farmers and the control <Col N="1449"/>arrangements that will be necessary. To coincide with the issue of the booklet, a series of countrywide farmer information meetings organised by my Department in conjunction with Teagasc, took place in early April. These meetings focused not only on cross compliance but also addressed the various other issues associated with the introduction of the single payment scheme.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>In implementing the single payment scheme, I am aiming to minimise the number of inspection visits and to move towards a situation where, in most cases, all eligibility and cross compliance checks will be carried out during a single farm visit. It is envisaged that the 22,000 or so inspections, which were carried out under the old regime, will be significantly reduced to some 10,000 under the single payment scheme. This approach should minimise the level of inconvenience to farmers. However, in certain instances more than one inspection of a holding may be unavoidable.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>In October last, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive. In December the Commission conveyed its view that the action programme was not complete and did not comply with the requirements of the directive or with the judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland, which had been delivered in March, 2004.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, my Department worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the preparation of an initial response to the Commission. This response was sent on 20 April. I understand that a revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, will be sent to the Commission shortly. Ireland has already submitted proposals for a derogation from the general limits laid down in the nitrates directive, designed to allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg. of organic nitrogen per hectare.</P>
        <P>As regards Sustaining Progress, the Government has already delivered fully on its undertakings in respect of the nitrates directive. A revised REPS was introduced in July 2004 which <Col N="1450"/>delivered average increases in payments of 28%. I am pleased to note that demand for the new scheme is very strong and that participation is about to reach an all-time record with every sign of continued growth.</P>
        <P>Improvements in the on-farm investment schemes were also introduced in line with undertakings in Sustaining Progress. The vast majority of Irish farmers can now avail of grant-aid as the ceiling for eligibility under the schemes has been raised from 200 to 450 income units &mdash; equivalent to an income of &euro;114,300. The investment ceilings have also been raised from &euro;50,790 to &euro;75,000 in the case of farm waste management works. A standardised grant rate of 40% now applies for most investments, twice that which would have been available to many farmers previously. In addition, increases have already been applied to the standard costs used to calculate grant aid, providing a solid basis for farmers to continue their efforts to improve standards in farming.</P>
        <P>The scheme of capital allowances for expenditure on farm pollution control has been extended to the end of 2006 and my colleague, the Minister for Finance announced in his budget on 1 December 2004 that the writing down period of special tax relief for expenditure on farm pollution control measures will be reduced from seven to three years in order to assist farmers to comply with the nitrates action programme.</P>

	<P>Promotion and development of renewable energy in Ireland are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>My Department is represented on the bioenergy strategy group established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural resources to consider policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the proportion of energy from biomass in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In addition, an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland. My Department is represented on that group. As part of the group&rsquo;s work, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, in December 2004. This report provides comprehensive details <Col N="1451"/>on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market.</P>
        <P>The possibility of producing bioethanol from sugar beet was mooted recently in the context of the closure of the Carlow sugar factory but Irish Sugar Ltd. has indicated that it intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which will be upgraded. Arrangements are being made to transport the sugar beet from the Carlow catchment area to Mallow. Under the single payment scheme operated by my Department aid is available at a rate of &euro;45 per hectare per year for areas sown with energy crops. The aid is granted in respect of areas where production is covered by a contract between the farmer and a processor, except in the case of processing undertaken by the farmer on his holding. Agricultural raw materials, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme provided the crops are intended primarily for use in the production of products considered to be biofuels and for electric and thermal energy produced from biomass.</P>
        <P>A maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for which aid for energy crops can be granted has been established in the European Union. According to figures provided by the EU Commission, in excess of 303,000 hectares was sown with energy crops in 2004, of which 439 hectares were Irish. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>The energy crops scheme and a number of other areas such as wood biomass will be considered by my Department to determine how their bioenergy potential can be promoted.</P>

	<P>Under the EU regulations governing the single payment scheme, farmers, who inherited holdings during or since the reference years from those who had entitlements established for them, may also inherit those entitlements. The farmers concerned should each complete an inheritance form in order to get the entitlements registered in their own names.</P>
        <P>The completed form together with supporting legal documentation should be sent to my Department&rsquo;s single payment office at Government Buildings, Portlaoise. To date, the Department has received some 13,919 applications in respect of the inheritance-only and the inheritance and new entrant combined measures and a further 2,341 applications were received in respect of the new entrant-only measure. To date, 13,292 applicants have been notified of the final decision in respect of their applications, while a further 1,1757 applicants have been requested to submit the required legal documentation such as grant of probate, letters of administration etc. to support their applications.</P>
        <P>Farmers who sold their milk quota into the milk quota restructuring scheme between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003 and who converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under the livestock or arable aid schemes would have been payable in respect of the years 2000 to 2002, may apply to the national reserve under category C for an allocation of entitlements. Application forms have been available for the national reserve since mid- December 2004 and the closing date for receipt of completed applications is 16 May 2005. Farmers who have already applied under the inheritance measure and whose case is under query may apply to the national reserve if they meet the eligibility conditions for the reserve. It is not necessary to know the outcome of the inheritance application before one applies to the national reserve under category C as it will be the extent to which the farmer has converted his enterprise which will be assessed.</P><Col N="1453"/>
        <P>The Department is at present processing some 16,500 national reserve applications already received. In view of the number of applications received and the documentation which must be obtained from some farmers, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the number or value of entitlements which will be allocated from the reserve.</P>
        <P>EU Council Regulation 1782/2003 introducing the single payment scheme stipulates that entitlements may only be based on the three reference years of 2000, 2001 and 2002. It also allows for the use of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in the case of hardship. The regulation does not provide for using any year subsequent to 2002 in the calculation of the single payment.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the Department has no option but to adhere to the regulations governing the scheme.</P>

        <P>I am extremely pleased at this news which meets a commitment made to the social partners in Sustaining Progress. The agreement of the European Commission to my Department&rsquo;s proposals means that some 750 farmers in the 322 townlands involved in County Monaghan will receive the higher &euro;88.88 per hectare more severely handicapped rate of payment from 2005 on as compared to the lower &euro;76.18 less severely handicapped rate per hectare which they have been receiving up to now.</P>
        <P>These 750 beneficiaries farming around 12,500 hectares will receive between them an additional &euro;160,000 each year as a result. Assuming they are eligible for compensatory allowances, all they have to do this year to qualify for the higher payment rate is complete their single payment application form in exactly the same way as they would have completed it if they were still only going to receive payments at the lower rate.</P>

	<P>Under EU Directive 2004/28, there is a general requirement that all medicines for food-producing animals must be brought under veterinary prescription control. However, taking account of difficulties Ireland and a small number of other member states had expressed about this prescriptive approach during negotiations on the legislation, provision has been made under the EU directive for exemptions to this general principle in accordance with criteria to be determined at EU level. The deadline for decisions on the exemptions is January 2007, pending which the EU legislation specifically provides that existing national distribution regimes may remain in place.</P>
        <P>My approach to the exemption provision is to seek at EU level to retain off-prescription status for those categories of medicines, such as wormers, which the Irish Medicines Board has determined on a scientific basis may be safely sold under existing controls without the need for a veterinary prescription. It remains to be seen whether this approach will be accepted by the Commission and other member states. However, I do not propose to pre-empt the outcome of this exercise by introducing a general legislative requirement that all medicines for food producing animals must be subject to a veterinary prescription.</P>

	<P>Milk quota regulations form part of European Union agriculture policy and, accordingly, the various Community regulations are transposed into Irish law by way of statutory instrument in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972. The last amendment to these regulations came into effect on 1 April, 2005 under the European Communities (Milk Quota) (Amendment) Regulations 2005, SI 177 of 2005. The purpose of this amendment, <i>inter alia</i>, was to allow for the transfer of quota within families without the transfer of land in certain circumstances. This exceptional provision facilitates the consolidation of quota within families, so improving the viability of existing enterprises. It also allows the retiring dairy producer to continue to farm the amount of lands needed to activate entitlements in the single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>I also provided that quota attached to lands purchased from 1 April 2005 must stay attached to those lands until 31 March 2009, the effect being that where quota lands are bought in the 2005-06 quota year, the quota must stay attached to lands for the same length of time as applied to quota lands bought in the 2004-05 quota year.</P>

	<P>A herd number is an administrative device used by my Department to identify and register owners or keepers of animals, particularly for the purposes of disease control and the implementation of the annual TB and brucellosis round tests. It has been the practice of my Department for some time when there are no bovine animals held under the herd number for a period to suspend the herd number so that testing under the bovine disease eradication programmes is not scheduled for such no-stock herds. Where a farmer who has maintained the eligibility conditions for a herd number wishes to restock the same holding with cattle within a short time, the herd number is re-activated on receipt of notification to the DVO by the farmer concerned.</P>
        <P>The suspension of the herd number from a bovine disease eradication perspective does not preclude the farmer from applying for other schemes if eligible for such and has no implications for ownership rights.</P>
        <P>The situation regarding the person indicated is that, in the course of checks on all untested herds due for test, the district veterinary office in Sligo received confirmation from the nominated private veterinary practitioner of the herd owner in question that he had no stock on his farm at the time. Accordingly, his herd number was suspended. A letter was sent to the herd owner on 4 March 2005 explaining that his herd number was being suspended as he had no cattle on his holding at present. He was advised that whenever he should decide to restock, he should make contact with the district veterinary office and his old herd number would be re-activated. He was further advised to contact any of the veterinary officials in the DVO should he require any clarification in relation to this matter. Data relating to the number of farmers, by region and year, from whom in such circumstances herd numbers have been withdrawn are not readily available.</P>

	<P>The objective of the European Council regulation which governs the current early retirement scheme is structural reform through the provision of a financial incentive to older farmers to retire early to facilitate their replacement by younger farmers who are considered more likely to improve the economic viability of the holding. The regulation sets down minimum requirements that must be met but enables individual member states to set additional conditions considered necessary to meet the objectives of the scheme. In designing the scheme, my Department considered that the focus should be on younger farmers and provided for a sliding upper age limit for prospective transferees starting at 45 years and reducing annually to 40 years for applications received in 2006. This age structure continues to be supported by the representatives of young farmers. I have no plans to change the age limits.</P>

The regulation sets down minimum requirements that must be met but enables individual member states to set additional conditions.</P>
        <P>The upper off-farm income limit for transferees is not a provision of the EU regulation. It was included in the current scheme to make it more likely that qualifying transferees would be younger farmers, with a greater commitment to farming, who are most likely to remain within the rural community and to continue in farming into the future. If the upper off-farm income limit were removed, it would increase the likelihood of holdings passing to transferees whose primary source of income was from non-farming and possibly urban activity and who would be less likely to retain a commitment to farming in the longer term. Their presence would in turn reduce the amount of land available to young farmers trying to make their future in farming.</P>

	<P>Botulism is not a notifiable disease <Col N="1461"/>under the Diseases of Animals Acts. However samples from animals may be submitted for testing to my Department&rsquo;s central veterinary laboratory or regional veterinary laboratories at the discretion of a private veterinary practitioner or on request by a herd owner through his or her private veterinary practitioner.</P>
        <P>Bovine botulism can be contracted by contact with contaminated decomposing organic material such as poultry litter which contains poultry carcass material and which has been spread on land grazed by cattle. The spreading of animal by-products, for example, litter containing poultry carcass material, on land is prohibited under Regulation EC No. 1774/2002. Manure from egg laying hens may be spread on pasture as there is no evidence that it presents a risk of botulism in cattle.</P>
        <P>While human beings may be affected by botulism, it should be noted that the specific toxins implicated in the conditions in humans are not those associated with the condition in cattle. The risk to human health from consumption of milk or meat from cattle on farms with cases of botulism, therefore, appears to be remote.</P>
        <P>In 2003, my Department wrote to dairy processors advising them about the condition and asking them to distribute to their producers an information-advisory note entitled Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land. Poultry processors were also circulated with a similar information-advisory note. Information Note on Botulism for Veterinary Practitioners and Instructions for Practitioners when dealing with Suspected Cases of Botulism on Farm were also circulated to private veterinary practitioners by district veterinary offices. Copies of the information referred to are available to farmers from district veterinary offices.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above, the Department&rsquo;s veterinary staff has held meetings with the industry to raise awareness on the issue. The poultry industry is well aware of the issues with regard to its obligations on the safe disposal of litter and carcass material in accordance with Regulation EC No. 1774/2002. Sections of the industry have been very proactive in dealing with this issue and have adopted good practice procedures. The veterinary inspectorate carries out annual inspections of waste disposal procedures on these farms, but diligence on the part of individual producers is required to ensure that good practice procedures are maintained. Indications so far this year suggest that there is a reduction in the reported incidence of the disease.</P>

	<P>Intensive negotiations concluded in August 2004 in agreement on a framework setting out the general outline and content of a new WTO agreement. The detailed implementation of this framework is the subject of ongoing negotiation at technical and political level and are likely to conclude at the next ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005.</P>
        <P>The main elements of the framework agreement from the EU and Irish perspectives are as follows. EU decoupled direct payments which are non-trade-distorting will qualify for inclusion in the WTO green box category of domestic supports and will, therefore, be exempt from reduction in the future. While the framework agreement provides for substantial improvements in market access, WTO members may self-select an appropriate number of sensitive products for special treatment in so far as tariff protection on imports is concerned. All forms of export supports, not just EU export refunds, will be reduced in parallel or subjected to disciplines, thereby ensuring EU exporters will not be at a competitive disadvantage on third country markets.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the framework agreement secured the benefits to EU and Irish farmers of the mid-term review of the CAP and represented a satisfactory outcome from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of pieces of legislation governing the labelling of meat and meat products. The general labelling regulations covering among other things all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. This legislation comes within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. My Department is responsible for policy regarding legislation on the labelling of specific products including beef and poultry meat.</P>
        <P>The labelling of beef is governed by EU regulations which were introduced in 2000. These require operators involved in the marketing of beef to label their product with a reference code to enable the beef to be traced back to the animal or group of animals from which it was derived; the approval number of the slaughterhouse and the country in which it is located; the approval number of the de-boning hall and the country in which it is located; and an indication of the origin of the animal from which the beef was derived.</P>
        <P>For the purpose of these regulations, marketing means all aspects of beef production and marketing up to and including retail sale. These labelling requirements, which are compulsory in all member states, apply to the marketing of beef within the community regardless of whether that beef was produced within the community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country and not all the above details are available, that beef must at a minimum be labelled as &ldquo;Origin: non-EC&rdquo; along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place.</P>
        <P>My Department introduced two regulations on the labelling of poultry meat at the beginning of last year. The first of these regulations requires poultry meat, both loose and pre-packaged, originating in a country outside the EU to bear an indication of the country of origin when offered for sale in a retail premises. The second requires information regarding class, price per unit weight, condition and slaughterhouse details in respect of loose poultry meat, that is, non-prepackaged, to be provided to the consumer. Heretofore, while these labelling indications have been compulsory for pre-packaged poultry meat, it had not been a <Col N="1466"/>requirement to provide this information for poultry meat sold loose.</P>
        <P>In addition to the above mentioned action, a working group within my Department is examining the labelling legislation for each of the meat sectors to identify any deficiencies, from a consumer viewpoint, in the labelling regulations for those commodities. Responsibility for the enforcement of all this legislation is now centralised with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and any instances of misleading labelling should be reported to that authority. I am satisfied that where it is shown that the regulations referred to above are not being complied with that the appropriate action to remedy the problem is being taken by the relevant agency.</P>

	<P>The prices received by producers and obtained in retail establishments are determined by the process of negotiation within the marketplace. The level of supply of a certain product, the degree of competitiveness within a sector and the level of consumer demand will all influence the final price received by the producer.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the prices received by retail outlets are dependent on a range of influences. The location of retailers, transport costs, the degree of processing and refinement of the product and other similar factors all have an impact upon the final pricing of foodstuffs. To find out more about this process, the consumer liaison panel has invited tenders to assess data sources on the price of food in Ireland. This has been done with a view to devising a model for monitoring food prices and the share of these prices absorbed at different stages of the supply chain. A research organisation has been chosen and their findings will be published in late 2005.</P>

	<P>The prepared consumer foods sector plays a significant role in the economy with annual output of &euro;2.6 billion, exports of &euro;1.3 billion and direct employment of 16,000. The sector is one of the fastest growing sub-sectors of the Irish food industry, with growth at about 10% per annum. The prepared consumer foods sector is comprised of almost 200 companies out of a total of 700 food processing enterprises in Ireland and 75% of exports go to the UK.</P><Col N="1467"/>
        <P>The key drivers in the sector include changes in consumer eating habits, a health focus, snacking products, cooking times, food service and new eating occasions such as in-car dining. The sector continues to develop high levels of growth based on market knowledge, customer led innovation and service. I am satisfied that the sector has kept pace with international developments and is well positioned to supply key blue chip customers in the UK.</P>
        <P>My Department and the food development agencies work closely with Irish food sector companies to assist them to develop, commercialise and market products that satisfy consumer demand and preferences across the main drivers of consumption. The food related provisions of the national development plan are focused on enhancing the competitiveness and innovative capability of the industry and ensuring market opportunities can be exploited.</P>

	<P>Preliminary indications are that potato plantings in 2005 will be slightly down on the 2004 figure of 12,600 hectares. Planting of the 2005 potato crop is ongoing. The annual national potato census takes place during the summer and results for 2005 will be published later in the year. The main varieties grown in 2004 were Rooster, which represented 54% of main crop production area, Kerr&rsquo;s Pink, British Queen and Record. The output value was &euro;85 million.</P>
        <P>The potato sector is one of the few agricultural commodity areas where the Common Market organisation does not operate and consequently production is market driven. The market for potatoes is price sensitive and recent years have seen significant volatility in terms of supplies and prices. Last year saw potato growers under considerable pressure as market returns declined considerably on the previous two years.</P>

	<P>Importation of meat and bonemeal or such products for any purpose to do with the farm animal and human food chain is prohibited. Under Community rules the importation of such products which have already been incorporated within pet foods and which are destined for meat eating animals is provided for subject to certain conditions. Data supplied by the Central Statistics Office indicate that the total quantity of pet food imported into this country from January to December 2004 was 40,621 tonnes.</P>
        <P>Importers of pet foods are required to register with my Department and give at least 24 hours&rsquo; notice of intention to import. In the case of pet food originating from an EU source, it must come from an approved establishment and be accompanied to its destination with a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the competent authority of the member state of origin. In the case of importation from third countries, it can only be imported under licence and must be presented to an authorised officer of my Department at a border inspection post. In such cases it must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment and be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance with the provisions of Community legislation.</P>

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In October 2004, Ireland submitted an action programme to the European Commission for further implementation of the nitrates directive.

This response was sent on 20 April. I understand that a revised action programme, on which my Department has been consulted, will be sent to the Commission very shortly. Ireland has also submitted proposals for derogation arrangements which would allow farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, at a higher level of intensity.</P>
        <P>Until agreement is reached with the European Commission on the terms of the action programme and the derogation arrangements, the full implications cannot be known with certainty. However, studies already undertaken by Teagasc indicate that the great majority of farmers are already operating below the general limit of 170 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum specified by the directive. A proportion of dairy specialist producers are operating above that level. However, the vast majority of these are operating below 250 kg per hectare, and the proposals already made to the Commission for derogation arrangements would accommodate such farmers.</P>
        <P>The nitrates action programme may have implications for the intensive farming sector, particularly in terms of the utilisation of the manure produced by intensive pig and poultry units, and accordingly I have asked my officials to examine how these may be mitigated. It remains my objective, and it is also the objective of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to reach agreement on an action programme that meets the objectives of the nitrates directive in terms of safeguarding water quality while also minimising the burden of compliance that the agreement will place on farmers and safeguarding the future of the commercial farming sector.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 374 together.</P>
        <P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU.</P>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. To be an approved third country, it must appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law; and have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; and traceability and labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states. The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Importers of animal products must be registered with my Department. They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years. Imported animal products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of <Col N="1471"/>production and, in the case of meat and meat extracts imported from third countries, a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.</P>
        <P>While there is free movement for trade within the EU, all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, or BIP, that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland, BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonised legislation, are being correctly applied. Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions, it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established, they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country, the Commission, in consultation with the standing committee on animal health and the food chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from EU countries or regions of countries may also be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously affect production and trade in animal products in the EU.</P>

        <Quest>the way in which she proposes to enhance the marketing of Irish beef and lamb at home and overseas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent years, the focus of the Irish beef and sheepmeat industry has been to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level. For beef this has meant shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. Effective promotion by Bord Bia and marketing by the industry has ensured a presence for top quality Irish beef and lamb in the key European markets. This includes supply arrangements with <Col N="1472"/>multiples and the main retailers in the UK, France, Italy and the Netherlands.</P>
        <P>The overall marketing approach is to build continually on the reputation of Irish meat as a high quality and safety assured product based on a natural, extensive and well controlled production sector at farm level. The new beef quality assurance scheme is now operational and Bord Bia will shortly be promoting the scheme to encourage the widest possible uptake. A strong interest in Irish beef and lamb has been generated by building its reputation through the media, by chefs&rsquo; endorsements and the creation of demand from premium chefs and restaurants in each of these markets. The main goal of our marketing strategy is to increase retail market penetration and to invest in growing awareness of Irish beef and lamb. This is being achieved by building relationships with key customers, product promotions and image building of the brand.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia will also shortly begin a promotion of new season lamb on the Irish market which will be extended over the months of May and June. The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy means farmers will enjoy greater freedom to grow and develop their enterprises producing for consumer requirements supported by the single farm payment. A targeted approach based on quality production represents the best and most profitable way forward for the Irish industry. This is particularly the case in the post-decoupling context when the market will be the sole determinant of the nature and scale of output from the sector. In such a context there will be a need for even greater emphasis on good breeding policies, payment related to quality and sophisticated and integrated supply and purchasing systems.</P>
        <P>Regarding third country trade, important markets such as Russia, Algeria and Egypt have re-opened for Irish beef while Lebanon is open for live exports. Access to the Algerian market has now been broadened to include frozen beef in addition to fresh and chilled product. A delegation from my Department and An Bord Bia recently visited Egypt and, along with embassy officials, held discussions with the Egyptian authorities with a view to relaxing the conditions under which exports to that country can take place. It is hoped to finalise a protocol with Egypt on these new conditions later this year. I have obtained the agreement of the European Commission to the continuation of the special export refund for Egypt which will also greatly assist trade during the year.</P>
        <P>France is the main export market for our lamb. While we export small quantities to other markets, Bord Bia&rsquo;s promotional activities are focused particularly on the valuable French market and it will be undertaking a campaign there in the coming months aimed at maintaining and increasing market share for Irish lamb. I am committed to opening and improving access to as <Col N="1473"/>many international markets as possible for Irish beef and lamb. My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia to achieve that aim.</P>

	<P>The general labelling regulations covering all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. European Directive 2000/13/EC on the labelling of foodstuffs requires prepackaged foodstuffs to carry information on the source or place of origin only where its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree on the origin of foodstuffs or their raw materials.</P>
        <P>The Community labelling requirements apply to all meat products and are compulsory in all member states. In addition, there are further labelling requirements that apply to beef sold at retail level regardless of whether that beef was produced within the Community or in a third country. Where beef is imported into the Community from a third country that beef must at a minimum be labelled as &ldquo;Origin: non-EC&rdquo; along with an indication of the third country in which slaughter took place. This detailed labelling system for beef sold at retail level, goes beyond the general labelling legislation provisions. While these EU regulations do not apply at restaurant and catering sector level, it is my intention to proceed with a national legal requirement that country of origin must be displayed in respect of beef sold in such premises and outlets. An internal committee has been established in my Department to consider the options.</P>
        <P>I believe consumers should be given maximum information on the origin of the food they are purchasing. I have joined with other member states in urging the Commission to examine EU labelling provisions to facilitate this.</P>

	<P>Payments under the 2004 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 November in line with the protocol commitments. Up to 99.4% of applicants have received their payments amounting to more than &euro;130 million. Payments under the four on-farm investment schemes, the farm waste <Col N="1474"/>management scheme, dairy hygiene scheme, installation aid scheme and alternative enterprises scheme, are up to date and in compliance with the protocol on direct payments to farmers.</P>
        <P>Payments to farmers in the rural environment protection scheme and to retired farmers in the scheme of early retirement from farming are processed in accordance with the targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers. The main forestry premium run took place successfully over the third week of April, making some 22,000 payments to the value of &euro;43 million. Payments under the 2004 disadvantaged areas compensatory allowances scheme commenced, as agreed with the farming bodies, on 19 September 2004. To date more than 98% of applicants have been paid their full entitlements amounting to more than &euro;234 million. Payments under the 2004 ewe supplementary premium scheme and ewe premium national envelope commenced on 16 October 2004 and 28 February 2005, respectively. To date 98.5% of applicants have received their full entitlements amounting to &euro;108 million. Payments under the 2004 extensification premium scheme normally commence in June. The advance payments under the slaughter premium scheme commenced on 16 October 2004. Balancing payments commenced on 20 April 2005 following the establishment of the quota position, as provided for under the protocol for direct payments. The advance payments under the special beef premium scheme commenced on 16 October 2004. Balancing payments commenced in early April to those applicants with up to 25 animals. Interim balancing payments, based on an estimate of the quota overshoot, began on 19 April 2005 to other applicants. These payments were made mindful of the position in which farmers found themselves, notwithstanding that the protocol for direct payments provides for the position regarding the quota to be established before the balancing payments are issued.</P>
        <P>The advance payments under the 2004 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 16 October 2004. Currently 98.8% of applicants have received advance payments amounting in total to &euro;143.8 million. Balancing payments commenced on 31 March 2005. To date a further &euro;84 million has been paid showing 91% of applicants fully paid at this time. Payments are still ongoing on a regular basis in line with targets set out under the protocol for direct payments to farmers.</P>

	<P>The deer population in Ireland stands at nearly 50,000 animals on some 300 units, producing almost 800 tonnes of venison annually. Deer numbers have increased by 10% since 1994. About 70% of production is exported to markets in Denmark, the UK and US. Fallow deer is exported to Denmark while red deer is supplied to the supermarket chains in Ireland and the UK and also to restaurants at home and in the US. There is severe competition from larger, lower cost producers abroad, especially Scotland and New Zealand, which influences price.</P>
        <P>Irish venison is a specialised high quality product that has established good quality markets at home and abroad. The structure of deer farming has altered over the last ten years. The average deer enterprise has increased in scale from six to ten hectares while the average breeding herd has risen almost twofold, from 48 to 88. While there may be fewer enterprises today, they are larger, more specialised and moving towards quality assured high value product outlets.</P>
        <P>The development of a quality assured venison scheme has improved the marketing potential of Irish venison, especially in supermarkets, and it is expected that this trend will continue. Approximately 100 deer farms are now quality assured.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The future development of the Irish dairy industry will depend on a number of factors including how it responds to the mid-term reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, how it reacts to the obligations imposed by the World Trade Organisation and how it avails of the increased marketing opportunities presented in the enlarged European Union and the wider global economy.</P>
        <P>The new intervention limits and reductions in intervention prices imposed by the MTR and <Col N="1476"/>preparations for the next round of the WTO reforms has focused the industry on the need to become less reliant on commodity products and to increase the added value nature of output. The Prospectus report commissioned by my Department and published in 2003 made clear recommendations on the response required from the dairy industry to meet international competitive challenges as well as the change in emphasis from market support to direct income support. The focus has to be firmly on increased efficiency and competitiveness at all levels of the industry. Response at individual company level to the issues raised by Prospectus are a matter for decision by the companies themselves.</P>
        <P>The past year has seen strong demand for dairy products on EU and international markets and this is likely to continue. However further reductions in support prices are due on 1 July as part of CAP reforms. It is vital that the period ahead is used by the dairy industry to position itself to meet the demands of a more competitive marketplace. I will continue to examine market developments to ensure that EU market management policies are managed sensitively and are utilised in a manner that will allow the industry to continue to grow, develop and increase its presence on competitive international markets.</P>

	<P>The first case of BSE in Ireland was diagnosed in 1989. In 1990 EU legislation was introduced which banned the feeding of meat and bonemeal to ruminant animals. These measures were significantly strengthened in the intervening years in the light of new information relating to the disease and the possible implications for human health. In 2001 all proteins derived from mammals was prohibited from being fed to all farmed animals.</P>
        <P>To ensure that this total ban was enforced effectively, my Department increased its level of sampling for processed animal proteins from 810 samples in 2000 to almost 3,500 in 2003, with that level maintained for 2004. This includes the sampling of all imported bulk consignments of feed materials along with extensive sampling of compound feeding stuffs and on-farm sampling. During 2003 and 2004, bone fragments have been detected in only four consignments out of a total of 7,000 samples. It is believed that these were as a result of cross-contamination rather than deliberate inclusion.</P><Col N="1477"/>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The year 2005 marks one of the most significant developments in the recent history of Irish farming as policy shifts from production supports to the decoupled single payment scheme. The new Common Agricultural Policy regime will allow Irish cereal farmers greater freedom to farm, giving many producers the opportunity to tailor their enterprises to meet consumer and market demand and to reflect their own strengths, individual preferences and aspirations. Improved efficiency of production at farm level will be important to maintain incomes and to ensure that the volume of output is maintained to support the processing sector. The maintenance of an efficient and viable cereals sector is of the utmost importance. In addition to providing an income for growers, it provides the livestock sector with an important source of feedstuffs. It is desirable to maintain the current level of production to avoid over-dependence on imported grain and I am satisfied that, subject to weather conditions, production will continue at the 2 million tonne average.</P>
        <P>Early indications show a drop in the sowing of winter cereals this year, with early estimates suggesting that winter sowings are back by up to 25% in some areas. This situation involved a combination of bad weather experienced during peak sowing time last autumn, uncertainty con<Col N="1478"/>cerning entitlements following decoupling, and farmers reconsidering their conacre options in the light of the new single payment scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department continues to operate a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing, recommended lists of varieties etc. In addition, Teagasc provides comprehensive research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereal producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world and I am satisfied the outlook for cereal growing in Ireland is quite positive and Irish cereal producers are well positioned to meet the competitive challenges ahead.</P>

        <P>I have recently approved a new statement of strategy for the Department of Agriculture and Food for 2005 to 2007, which is expected to be published in May or early June. Sixty-six divisions within the Department have prepared detailed work plans for this year, based on this strategy <Col N="1479"/>and the outcome from this work will be presented in the annual report of the Department. The 2004 annual report will be published shortly.</P>
        <P>The agri-vision 2015 committee provided a comprehensive analysis of what is required to enable the agri-food sector maintain and improve its competitiveness over the next ten years and contribute to a healthy and vibrant rural economy and environment. The proposals in that report are now being examined and an implementation plan is being prepared.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</P>
        <P>I understand that an application for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006 was submitted by the group in question to my Department some time ago.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, each application for funding undergoes a thorough assessment by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which has been engaged to carry out the day-to-day administration of the programme on my behalf. Following this assessment all applications are then considered by the programme appraisal committee, PAC, which is chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision regarding funding.</P>
        <P>This project proposal was one of a number submitted to develop child care services in Templemore. I understand that in this case the PAC was unable to recommend the project to me for funding as it did not adequately meet the criteria of the EOCP with regard to the levels of service provision being proposed. Specifically, it was considered that the planned project did not represent good value for money as it proposed a limited range of service types and operating hours, and did not propose to offer a full day care service. The service will provide two sessional services running from 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon and from 12.30 p.m. to 4.00 p.m., thus providing part time child care places only. The project which was selected for capital support under the EOCP last December offered a broader range of services for a larger number of children.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the child care directorate of my Department that the group referred to here has recently appealed my decision not to grant funding. ADM Limited will re-assesses the application in the light of this appeal and will take full account of any additional information which the group may wish to offer in support of its application and of local need. Following this re-assessment the outcome will be considered by the PAC, which will also take into account any of the additional information supplied that may be relevant, before making a recommendation to me regarding funding. The group concerned will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible. In the interim, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this application or to meet with the group.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that police certificates of character are issued solely for the purpose of obtaining a visa from non-national embassies and consulates. These certificates are issued locally by Garda superintendents.</P>
        <P>In tandem, the Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, carries out criminal record vetting in respect of prospective full-time employees of the Health Service Executive and in certain designated agencies funded by the executive.</P>
        <P>Although persons in the situation referred to by the Deputy cannot currently avail of this Garda vetting regime, it is envisaged that a phased extension of the vetting arrangements to relevant groups will take place. To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue.</P>
        <P>The working group submitted its final report in March 2004, and the report has since been published in electronic form on my Department&rsquo;s website. On the basis of this report, my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children, has announced the provision of additional staff resources for the GCVU to enable the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s vetting services to be extended.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement implements one of the key recommendations of the working group. The other practical recommendations are being brought forward by an implementation group chaired by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and comprising representatives of my Department; the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science, and Finance; the office of the Attorney General; and Mr. Paul Gilligan, CEO of the ISPCC.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that the extension of the services of the GCVU will commence in the course of this year, as soon as the necessary practical arrangements are in place, and public announcements will be made in this regard in due course.</P>

	<P>Garda youth diversion projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employment prospects. By doing so, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations. The number of projects has grown from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently, a process made possible, in part, by funding under the National Development Plan 2000 &mdash; 2006. The locations of new projects are decided upon by the Garda authorities in conjunction with my Department. There are currently three Garda youth diversion projects, KEY, JAY and YEW operating in the Tallaght area, which collectively cater for 134 participants and which received funding of &euro;333,074 in 2004. In addition, there is one sergeant and four garda juvenile liaison officers operating from Tallaght Garda station.</P>
        <P>I am committed to the continuing development and, as resources permit, the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects. Proposals made by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to my Department on establishing further projects are examined within the context of available resources. All applications relating to the establishment of further projects should follow the establishment process as set out in the Garda youth diversion project guidelines which I launched in 2003. The 11 establishment guidelines give a clear structure to the application process from the initial expression of interest to the final submission of the proposal and cover issues such as the pre-establishment phase, consultation, memorandum of understanding, legal structure, coordinator&rsquo;s job description and catchment area.</P>
        <P>A budget of &euro;5.471 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2005. It is expected that this amount will be required to meet the funding needs of the projects currently in operation. It is not envisaged that additional youth diversion projects will be established in the short term. However, the possibility of funding further <Col N="1484"/>projects in light of prevailing budgetary conditions remains, and in this context the application for the project referred to by the Deputy will be kept under review.</P>

	<P>The Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006 provides grant assistance towards the staffing costs of community based or not-for-profit child care services which have a clear focus on disadvantage and which can demonstrate that they are supporting disadvantaged parents to access employment, education or training.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the group in question was awarded staffing grant assistance of &euro;190,461, over three years, in August 2001. Staffing grants are normally made available for three years in the first instance. I approved the continuation of the existing levels of staffing grant assistance until 31 August 2005 for those groups whose first three-year funding elapsed and who showed, following a short reassessment, that they were continuing to deliver child care services in accordance with their targets.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Rathkeale community cr&egrave;che, I am told that its service is currently being assessed for continuation staffing funding by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which is engaged to administer the grants on my behalf. ADM has been in dialogue and in correspondence with the group and is awaiting the group&rsquo;s March 2005 quarterly return in order to advance this short assessment process. When ADM receives the necessary information, it will be considered by the EOCP appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, and the group will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the written reply I gave to Parliamentary Question No. 160, reference 9900/05, on Thursday, 24 March 2005.</P>
        <P>An application has been received in my Department from the person concerned seeking permission to remain in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish born child under the revised arrangements announced by me on 15 January 2005.</P>
        <P>Applications are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible and, in so far as is possible, in order of receipt. Given the number of applications being processed, it is expected that the processing of the application from the person concerned will be completed within the next few weeks. This scheme does not make any provision for persons granted permission to remain to be joined by family members from outside the State.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 10 February 2004.</P>
        <P>The average processing time for such applications is currently 24 months. On the basis of the current average processing time, therefore, it is likely that the application of the individual concerned will be finalised in early 2006.</P>
        <P>I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy as soon as I have reached a decision on this application.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this is an application under section 49, acquisition of title by virtue of long possession, of the Registration of Title Act 1964 which was lodged on 4 February 2004 &mdash; dealing No. D2004SM001110A refers.</P><Col N="1490"/>
        <P>I understand that due to their complicated nature applications under section 49 which require detailed examination of claims for registration as owners can take some time to process. Accordingly it is not possible to estimate a completion date at this stage. However, I assure the Deputy that this application is receiving attention in the Land Registry and will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>The Village Project is a com<Col N="1498"/>munity-based, day assessment service that offers a comprehensive assessment to young people from the Finglas, Ballymun and surrounding areas. Following a request from the Department of Education and Science, my Department commenced funding the Village Project on 1 January 2004. Prior to that, funding had been provided by the Minister for Education and Science. Since 1 January 2004, 21 males and 12 females have been assessed. As my Department, through the probation and welfare service, is now funding the Village Project, the project will, in future, cater mainly for children on whom a request has been made by the courts to the probation and welfare service for a probation officer&rsquo;s report. It may also provide an assessment service to referrals <Col N="1499"/>from other relevant State and community based services when resources allow. It will also be open to children who have had contact with the centre in the past to attend occasionally where this is considered to be in the best interest of the children concerned.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 413 to 419, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Roscommon and Strokestown Garda subdistricts are included in the Garda district of Roscommon. Elphin and Boyle Garda subdistricts are included in the Garda district of Boyle. Ballaghaderreen and Castlerea are in the Castlerea Garda district. Ballinasloe Garda district includes parts of County Roscommon and County Galway. Each of the ten headline offences listed in the following tables contains different individual offences and these can be found in more detail in the relevant Garda annual reports for the years in question. It is also important to note that the statistics provided for 2004 are provisional and are, therefore, subject to validation and change.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, I understand from the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of the Roscommon-Galway East Garda division as at 28 April 2005 was 252 &mdash; all ranks. The establishment of a full-time Garda station in the south Roscommon area would necessitate the deployment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties and that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.</P><Col N="1499"/>

        <P FLI="0">This expansion of the staffing resources of the traffic corps will occur in tandem with the overall expansion of the Garda force to 14,000 members over that period. All personnel assigned to the new traffic corps will have completed the standard training programme. It is important to remember that all garda&iacute; have responsibility, <i>inter alia</i>, to enforce road traffic laws as and when breaches of road traffic laws occur.</P>
        <P>Resources will be deployed in built-up areas, on non-urban regional and local roads, national roads and motorways, in order to achieve the six strategic objectives for road traffic policing iden<Col N="1504"/>tified in the strategic review of traffic policing, namely, contribute to reducing road fatalities and casualties; improve traffic flows; enforce road traffic legislation effectively and consistently; enforce road transport and haulage legislation effectively and consistently using available technologies; provide appropriate policing support and response to the national development plan provisions relating to traffic and transport; and provide a systematic and structured road traffic collision investigation service, and provide accurate, timely and sufficiently detailed information to key stakeholders.</P>
        <P>Vehicles dedicated to the Garda traffic corps and traffic duties are in a constant state of evolution in terms of their equipment and markings. The objective of the Garda fleet management section with regard to the provision of resources for traffic law enforcement is to ensure traffic units have at their disposal the most effective transport resources to safely manage the traffic on Irish roads. To date this year 24 vehicles have been allocated to traffic duties as part of the normal replacement program. Further replacements will take place during 2005.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 191 and 207 on 21 April last, in which I expressed my extreme disappointment at the rejection by staff of the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service. The proposal emerged following protracted negotiations at the Labour Relations Commission and an arbitration process and was recommended for acceptance by the national executive of the Prison Officers Association. I also outlined the steps that I am compelled to take to ensure the valuable resources at my disposal are used efficiently, wisely and effectively.</P>
        <P>As regards the question of resolving the dispute with the prison officers, the Deputy will be aware that I have utilised to the full all of the available industrial relations machinery in the State over a lengthy period, up to and including arbitration, in an effort to reach a mutually acceptable way forward. There is no further industrial relations forum to which the dispute can be taken. Prison officers have made their choice in the full knowledge of the consequences. I have no option but to proceed immediately with the agenda approved by Government to ensure the Prison Service is run as efficiently and cost effectively as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer the Deputy's attention to the Adjournment debates on 12 November and 19 November 2003 regarding measures to contain prison costs, including possible new management arrangements for the open prison in County Cavan which would not involve the Irish Prison Service. The rationale behind the proposal to have alternative arrangements for the operation of this prison is outlined therein. I fully support the work that open centres do and would prefer to see an enhanced role for them in the criminal justice system. I advocate more open regimes, <Col N="1506"/>rather than less. However, the unfortunate fact of life is that we are prevented by the millstone of excessive and unnecessary overtime in the Prison Service from doing the things for which people inside and outside the system have been calling for years.</P>
        <P>I have indicated on numerous occasions that I would allow this centre to continue to be operated by the Prison Service and staffed by prison officers, provided that it was done on a sensible, reasonable and effective basis. However the rejection by staff of the proposal for organisational change, which was recommended for acceptance by the Prison Officers&rsquo; Association, means that I have no option but to move to reduce costs by whatever means are practicable.</P>
        <P>The decision to withdraw the two open centres in Counties Cavan and Wicklow from the Prison Service and to introduce a facility for persons on temporary or early release from prison at both locations under new management will allow me to permanently redeploy the staff in these institutions to other prisons where they will contribute to the reduction in the overtime bill and ensure the needs of offenders continue to be met.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 20 fixed camera installation post sites in all, located on the N1, N2, N3, N4, M1 and M50. Three cameras are rotated between these posts. Four camera installation posts are non-operable as a result of vandalism. Two of these posts <Col N="1507"/>were damaged by fire and the other two knocked over and damaged. A contractor has been engaged to replace damaged equipment and reinstate and commission the posts. The work is expected to be completed in the very near future. Situations such as this are not satisfactory to me and in that regard I might mention that recently an assistant commissioner was appointed to oversee the various initiatives being taken by the force in relation to the effective management of road traffic issues. There is no distinction in the applicability of Irish law to drivers from within or outside the jurisdiction. I am not aware of a distinction in the applicability of laws of Northern Ireland to drivers from within or outside that jurisdiction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>No international human rights norms require the granting of Irish citizenship to Romanian citizens simply on the basis of their residence in the State. Even where a non-national has been granted refugee status, and is thus acknowledged as a person who is unable to seek the protection of his or her country of origin, the 1951 Geneva Convention imposes no obligation regarding the conferral of citizenship, notwithstanding the fact that it does impose obligations on the State to allow the person in question to reside here. The policy as outlined in my response to the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers has been the policy operated by successive Ministers for many years. As I indicated in that response, an exception is made in the case of refugees and stateless persons.</P>
        <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers is neither a refugee nor a stateless person. He entered the State in 1997 and applied for asylum. That application was unsuccessful as was the subsequent appeal. It was open at that stage to the person concerned to leave the State but he chose to stay and obtained permission to remain, as an exceptional measure, on 25 August 1999. Permission was granted, notwithstanding the fact <Col N="1508"/>that he was not self-sufficient and the form of permission granted exempted him from the employment permit requirement, thus placing him at an employment related advantage over many thousands of non-EEA national workers who entered the State under the employment permit regime and did not claim asylum.</P>
        <P>Records of applications which have been finalised are not maintained in a way which would show the number of individual decisions based on self-sufficiency. Even if they were, the legitimacy of access to State supports by the persons in question is not at issue here nor is permission to reside in the State, those being separate matters entirely from naturalisation. It cannot be that advantageous treatment given by organs of the State to members of our non-national community, whether in the form of back to work schemes, employment permit free conditions or otherwise, must rely on the subsequent naturalisation of the beneficiaries for their legitimacy as instruments of public policy. If advantageous schemes of the type to which I have referred have the desired effect, it will reduce the likelihood of a future naturalisation application being turned down on self-sufficiency grounds.</P>

	<P>Responsibility for the provision of spaces for young offenders committed to custody when they are under the age of 16 years lies with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. I have general responsibility for the provision of spaces for persons committed to custody once they are 16 years of age or over. However, while offenders under the age of 15 years cannot be committed to a prison under any circumstances, 15 year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to a prison falling under my area of responsi<Col N="1511"/>bility in exceptional circumstances. This can occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act 1908 that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he or she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act.</P>
        <P>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution is a closed institution reserved in law exclusively for male offenders aged 16 to 21 years and has bed capacity for 220 prisoners, a figure which has increased from one of 172 in the mid-1990s. In addition, each of the <Col N="1512"/>prisons in the State can accommodate persons aged 17 years and over. As the prison system must accommodate all those committed to its custody from the courts, it does not, therefore, operate on a waiting list system.</P>
        <P>With these provisions in mind, 19 male offenders aged 16 years of age were in custody on 3 May 2005. Each of these persons was detained in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution. In addition, 49 male offenders aged 17 years of age were in custody on that date. Their whereabouts are set out in the following table. On the same date no female juveniles were in the prison system.</P><Col N="1511"/>

	<P>The person concerned, an Angolan national, arrived in the State on 31 July 2003 and applied for asylum. His application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 15 February 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>.

A prefabricated building was erected on the site and some work will be required to this building in the near future.

Under the procedures then applicable, his application was refused by the asylum division and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Subsequently, he was informed by letter dated 28 January, 1999, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was given the option, to be exercised within 14 working days, of either voluntarily leaving the State before an order is made, or making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. This person&rsquo;s case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which deals with prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. I expect the case file to be passed to me for decision in due course.</P>

	<P>A key issue to be addressed in the installation of Finglas town centre CCTV system is the provision of suitable accommodation to house the monitoring equipment. It was initially hoped that this could be accommodated in Finglas Garda station. However, this station is not of an acceptable standard and I have already stated that immediate priority is being given to providing a new Garda station. A suitable site has been identified by the Office of Public Works on the Mellowes Road and I understand that the OPW is in negotiation to agree the terms for the purchase. In the interim, in addition to carrying out certain necessary refurbishment works to the station, the OPW is negotiating the lease of a premises to accommodate the monitoring of CCTV cameras in the Finglas area.</P>

	<P>In May 1999 an interdepartmental review group was tasked to examine the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86. In its report, published in June 2000, the group concluded:</P>
        <P LI="1" FLI="0">separate standards for off-line and on-line environments will only create serious problems for society in the longer term. However, liability issues in the internet gambling area are likely to be as complex as in other areas of internet activity. In an internet environment, special consideration would have to be given to both the liability and protection of the player. With internet operations, the provider may not be within the jurisdiction and may be providing a service which may be legal where the service is being hosted, but illegal where the service is being accessed. This is not an unusual phenomenon in internet services. The logistical not to speak of legal difficulties of dealing with this situation and of enforcing the law at player level are enormous. Attempts to fix liability at internet service provider level are also fraught with difficulties.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The range of illegal uses of the Internet and the enforcement difficulties associated with such use were also examined in the first report of the <Col N="1515"/>working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet published in 1998. While that report did not examine the specific problems associated with gambling on the Internet, many of the conclusions reached in the report are valid for the gambling area.</P>
        <P>Under a code of practice and ethics agreed by the Irish Internet service provider industry in 2002, material or services that are illegal under Irish law will not be carried on Irish servers, and if such is found they will be removed immediately under agreed protocols.</P>

	<P>A national DNA databank would be of great assistance to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the detection of crime and I support the introduction of such a database. It is my intention to draw up proposals for the establishment of a DNA database which would, having regard to constitutional requirements and the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights, permit as extensive a databank as possible. As I previously indicated to the House, the Law Reform Commission is examining the issues surrounding the establishment of a DNA databank. The commission has published a consultation paper on the subject and the final report is awaited. I look forward to examining the report and, in due course, bringing forward my proposals in this regard.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of Fethard Garda station as at 3 May 2005 was one sergeant and one garda. I am further advised that local Garda management is satisfied with the current policing arrangements in the Fethard sub-district.</P>
        <P>Regarding Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Fethard sub-district will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts <Col N="1520"/>and sub-districts throughout the country. Clearly the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing where they will have a real impact.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and four mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 116 pupils at 30 September 2003.</P>
        <P>In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher and two full-time resource teacher posts, one of whom is allocated on a temporary basis. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school referred to by the Deputy was 104 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>As outlined in primary circular 19/02, an independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made after the schedule for the 2005-06 school year has issued.</P>
        <P>A revised system for allocating resource teachers and learning support teachers was announced last year and a review of this system is taking place with particular reference to its impact on small and rural schools.

A decision on the application will be conveyed to the school as soon as the application has been considered.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created. This scheme has been superseded by a <Col N="1523"/>more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?><P>The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme does not provide for the linking of the grants to any particular pay scale and is flexible by nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The school referred to by the Deputy receives grant assistance towards the provision of secretarial and caretaking services under this scheme.</P>
        <P>The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school. The standard rate of grant was increased from &euro;102 to &euro;127 per pupil in 2004 and was further increased to &euro;133 per pupil this year. Accordingly, the school referred to received &euro;15,162 by way of grant assistance under the ancillary services grant scheme on the basis of the school&rsquo;s enrolments in 2005. My Department has no further funds at its disposal from which additional moneys can be made available to schools towards the cost of secretarial or caretaking services.</P>
        <P>The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial and caretaking services as resources permit. It is a matter for each school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit its particular needs. The question of increasing the rate of the ancillary services grant in future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector. The school has the services of one permanent resource teacher and a shared learning support teacher, which is 0.8 of a post.</P>

I understand that actions by the board resulted in 8,616 of these cases being closed by the end of <Col N="1527"/>December 2004 leaving 9,262 on hands in January 2005.</P>
        <P>I also understand that the board issued the first school attendance notices, SANs, to parents in March 2005. SANs are legal notices requiring the parent to send the child to a named school for a specified period of time. They are the first step in taking legal action against parents who have failed over time to co-operate with educational welfare officers to ensure that their children attend school and where the board considers that parents could do more to uphold their children&rsquo;s right to an education.</P>

	<P>The school planning section of my Department is assessing the rationalisation of national schools in County Tipperary, which includes the school to which the Deputy refers. My Department has requested the local inspector to provide long-term projections for both schools to establish the extent of accommodation which will be needed to facilitate the amalgamation. In addition, a technical inspection has been carried out on the existing buildings to determine which, if either, would be suitable to act as a host for the new school. A greenfield site solution will be necessary if a host does not emerge. The technical report will be available in my Department shortly.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, the project has been assessed in accordance with the agreed prioritisation criteria for large-scale projects and it has been assigned a band 1.4 rating, that is, rationalisation.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 478 and 480 together.</P>
        <P>Section 4 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 enables additional institutions, <Col N="1530"/>in which children were placed and resident and in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule to the Act.</P>
        <P>Since the enactment of the legislation, my Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Accordingly, consultations have taken place between my Department and other Departments which may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain the case for their inclusion under the Act.</P>
        <P>While inquiries have not yet been completed in respect of all institutions, I signed an order on 9 November 2004 which provided for the inclusion of 13 additional institutions in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>Further consultations are taking place on a number of institutions and I will consider the position of these institutions when this process has been completed. As part of that consultation process my Department is exploring with the trustees-management of some institutions the possibility of a contribution being made by them towards the redress scheme.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that any decision to include an additional institution will not be made conditional on a contribution being forthcoming and the question of obtaining legal advice on such a condition does not therefore arise. Nonetheless, it is desirable to explore the issue before a final decision is made.</P>

	<P>The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003.</P>
        <P>With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE, through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs. Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a post-primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil.</P>
        <P>The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some students are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and-or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. For example, a special class cater<Col N="1531"/>ing for children with a mild general learning disability would have a support rate equating with a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 11 to one. A class catering for children on the autistic spectrum would be supported at a pupil teacher ratio of six to one. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.</P>

	<P>My Department does not have detailed data on private sector recycling and recovery facilities. It is accepted, however, that while there is an ever-increasing number of recyclables collection facilities, a great deal of the actual recycling is carried out in other countries. In the case of municipal waste, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that some 69% of recycling took place abroad in 2003. A range of measures designed to promote recycling is already in place and the available data shows that these are having a significant impact.</P>
        <P>These measures include the progressive roll-out of segregated household collection of dry recyclables &mdash; kerbside green bin collection services &mdash; to more than 560,000 households, or some 42% of all households in the State. The number of bring banks has doubled since 1998 and now stands at approximately 1,700, with more being provided on an ongoing basis. The number of civic amenity sites has nearly doubled with approximately 60 in place. Some recycling centres are at earlier stages of development. The mandatory obligation under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003 on those placing packaging on the market to segregate specified packaging waste, including aluminium, fibreboard, glass, paper, plastic sheeting, steel and wood arising on their premises and have it collected by authorised operators for recycling is widely accepted to be contributing to a significant increase in the recycling rates for these materials in the commercial sector. The successful producer-responsibility initiatives for packaging waste, farm plastics and construction and demolition waste will be extended to other areas such as tyres, newsprint, end-of-life vehicles and electrical and electronic equipment. The development of markets for recyclable materials is to be taken forward under the aegis of a market development group which was established in July 2004.</P>
        <P>Biodegradable municipal waste is now to be targeted for major improvements in recycling and a national strategy on biodegradable waste to guide efforts in this area will be finalised later this year. The changeover to pay-by-use waste charging systems, which commenced in January, will enable householders to reduce their waste charges by increasing their recycling rates, thereby minimising the need for waste to be collected for disposal.</P><Col N="1536"/>
        <P>Significant progress has been made in increasing recycling levels in Ireland in recent years. The latest figures available on municipal waste generation, recovery and disposal are contained in the national waste database interim report for 2003, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2004. According to the report, the recycling rate in the municipal waste stream has advanced to 28.4% in 2003, up from 20.7% in 2002. I envisage that further improvements in our recycling efforts will continue to be made as a result of the ongoing implementation of the local and regional waste management plans.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, has over the years committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon. While the provision of Exchequer grant assistance for radon remediation works or radon detectors is not envisaged, effort will continue to be directed at improving information to householders to enable them to address monitoring or remedial requirements effectively and economically.</P>
        <P>During the years 1992 to 1999, the RPII carried out a national survey of radon in domestic dwellings aimed at assessing the extent of the radon problem in homes. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12-month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km by 10 km grid square throughout the country. The RPII&rsquo;s website contains a comprehensive map of the high radon areas in Ireland as well as the report of its national survey of radon in homes.</P>
        <P>In February 2002, my Department published a booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings &mdash; Corrective Options, advising designers, builders and home owners on remediation options for reducing radon in existing houses to or below the national reference level. Upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997, require all new houses which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998 to incorporate radon protection measures. My Department has recently published an updated edition of technical guidance document C &mdash; TGD-D &mdash; on part C of the building regulations, site preparation and resistance to moisture, incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005. This new guidance document is aimed at ensuring that the 1997 radon <Col N="1537"/>protection measures are carried out more effectively.</P>
        <P>In recent months, the RPII has undertaken several initiatives to further heighten awareness of radon in Ireland. In November 2004, the RPII hosted the third national radon forum in Dublin to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. Earlier this year, the RPII published a revised version of its booklet, Radon in Homes, and also published a booklet in October 2004, Understanding Radon Remediation; A Householders Guide. The RPII also plans to distribute an information poster on radon for display in libraries, medical centres and other public areas advising people to have their homes checked for radon. Both the RPII and my Department will continue to use all appropriate opportunities to raise public awareness of radon and to encourage householders with radon concentrations above the national reference level to undertake remediation works.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has encouraged local authorities to undertake public private partnerships for the delivery of social and affordable housing, providing that this route offers value for money. Most of the contracts entered into to date <Col N="1538"/>are in the form of partnering arrangements with developers to deliver social and or affordable housing on local authority lands with private housing also being permitted as part of the arrangement. In the case of affordable housing, the arrangement can involve the sale of the land with conditions attached regarding the affordable housing to be provided.</P>
        <P>As the mix of development can vary with some also including commercial or community facilities, information on the exact level of private funding is not obtained by the Department. Generally, these arrangements result in social and affordable housing being provided at much reduced or, in some instances, at no cost to the Exchequer and in an improved social mix. For example, the regeneration of Fatima Mansions is being pursued through a public private partnership arrangement involving the provision of 150 units of rented accommodation, 70 affordable units and approximately 300 private units. In this case, it is expected that the redevelopment will be Exchequer neutral on the basis that the land costs for the private units will fund the provision of social units as well as the provision of significant community facilities.</P>
        <P>Public private partnership arrangements are being developed within the sector with other forms of public private partnerships likely to play a role in the future. These include swapping land for housing units as part of the implementation of the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative and the provision of accommodation through new rental accommodation scheme.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s integrated strategy on homelessness was launched in 2000 and its homeless preventative strategy in 2002. Under the terms of the integrated strategy, homeless fora, representative of the statutory and voluntary homeless sectors, were established at local authority level and, under their aegis, homelessness action plans were adopted and are in the process of being implemented. These developments have resulted in the provision of a wide range of additional accommodation and services <Col N="1540"/>for homeless persons. People who sleep rough have been enabled to access emergency accommodation and homeless persons have been facilitated to move out of emergency accommodation into accommodation more suitable to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities, together with specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless ex-offenders, have been put in place.</P>
        <P>While the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons is the responsibility of local authorities, my Department recoups to them 90% of their expenditure in this area. Details of amounts recouped since the implementation of the integrated strategy are set out in the following table.</P><Col N="1539"/>

While it is a matter for individual local authorities to decide on the allocation of houses to single persons and other categories on their waiting lists in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities, my Department has advised local authorities of the need to provide a reasonable mix of dwellings suited to the different kinds of households already on waiting lists and to plan their future programmes taking account of the estimated size and type of households likely to be seeking housing in the future.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501 and 502 together.</P>
        <P>In July 2004, I announced significant improvements to the loan and income limits for shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. The eligibility limit for applying for these schemes is now &euro;36,800 for a single income household. In the case of a two-income household, both incomes are assessed in determining eligibility on the basis of a formula whereby two and a half times the main income and once the second income cannot exceed &euro;92,000.</P>
        <P>The maximum loan which may be advanced by local authorities for the acquisition of a house under these schemes is &euro;165,000. In the case of shared ownership loans, where appropriate up to above maximum may be advanced by a local authority in respect of the purchased equity in a house. As ownership is shared between the purchaser who buys at least 40% of the value of the house and the local authority from whom the purchaser rents the remaining share, the house price can in such cases be significantly in excess of the loan.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority to administer house purchase loans in its area having <Col N="1542"/>regard, as appropriate, to the housing needs and circumstances of its area. In determining the maximum mortgage loan in each case, local authorities should have regard to the purchaser&rsquo;s ability to repay by reference to their net household income. My Department continues to monitor the various housing schemes taking into account the movement in house prices, the effectiveness of various schemes in meeting the needs of the relevant target group and the availability of mortgage finance in the private sector.</P>

	<P>Land use and zoning decisions are generally local government functions in other jurisdictions. Subsidiarity in the taking of decisions at the lowest appropriate level is a principle which has been endorsed at inter<Col N="1543"/>national and national level. I consider, therefore, that efforts should continue to be directed at making local responsibility for zoning in Ireland operate to high standards of probity and efficiency; rather than to make all zoning decisions subject to central supervision and review. The key challenge is to ensure openness, probity, fairness and efficiency in the operation of the planning system.</P>
        <P>The Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Local Government Act 2001 introduced a number of measures in this regard. Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 introduced a comprehensive ethics regime for councillors and local government employees which came into effect on 1 January 2003. The regime includes annual declaration of interests, disclosure of interests as a matter arises and a public register of interests. The regime was further enhanced by the national codes of conduct for councillors and employees which issued last year.</P>
        <P>The Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments also has a mandate to issue recommendations in relation to such amendments to planning, local government, ethics in public office and any other relevant legislation as the tribunal considers appropriate having regard to its findings. I will consider any such recommendations when the tribunal makes its final report.</P>

Detailed cost estimates would mainly be a matter for the private sector waste industry to which the provision of much of this required infrastructure would fall.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant proportion of households already have kerbside collection of dry recyclables. At the end of 2003, the most recent period for which national data is available, 563,681 households had a dry recycl<Col N="1545"/>able collection, comprising more than 40% of households in the State, and this will have further increased in the intervening period. My Department is not in a position to estimate the cost of rolling out kerbside collection to all remaining households as collection costs vary significantly depending on location.</P>
        <P>I am pleased at the continuous improvements in the levels of recycling being achieved. Approximately 28% of municipal waste is now being diverted from landfill, which is a substantial improvement on the situation in 2001 when it stood at under 10%. Kerbside collection has a key part to play in this, but I also remain committed to enhancing the network of bring centres and civic amenity sites which often accept materials that cannot be put in a green bin and which all householders can use.</P>

	<P>The provision of appropriate heating systems is eligible for funding under both the disabled person&rsquo;s and essential repairs grant schemes. Decisions on the type and extent of work which may be grant aided in individual cases are matters for the local authorities who are responsible for the administration of the schemes.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by the Health Service Executive, provision of a suitable heating system appropriate to the needs of the elderly person in the context of the other improvements and repair works to a dwelling may also be funded. In addition, in July 2004, my Department introduced a new central heating programme to assist local authorities in providing central heating facilities in their rented dwelling which lack them. The scheme has been extended for a further period in 2005.</P>
        <P>The disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme, like other housing grant schemes operated by my Department, is intended to assist persons in the provision of additional accommodation or in carrying out works of adaptation, but is not designed to cover the full cost of works for all applicants. Local authorities may provide reconstruction loans to qualified applicants who have difficulty in obtaining finance to meet the balance of the cost.</P>
        <P>The administration of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme is a matter for the local authorities within the framework laid down in statutory regulations which, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate level of flexibility at local level. The basic requirements for obtaining a disabled person&rsquo;s grant are that the work for which it is sought is, in the opinion of the local authority, reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering a house more suitable for the accommodation of a disabled member of the household and that the terms of the disabled person&rsquo;s grant scheme, as adopted by the local authority, are complied with.</P>
