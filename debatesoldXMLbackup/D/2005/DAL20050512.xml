	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member. Yesterday, on the question, &ldquo;That Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in be suspended from the service of the D&aacute;il&rdquo;, a division was claimed and, in accordance with Standing Order 61, that division must take place now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, in view of the spiralling suicide rates, the urgent necessity for every person employed in the health service to be provided with a suicide information pack and appropriate specialist prevention training in the recognition of the signs and symptoms related to suicide and that these training and information packs be extended to all teachers, Garda and community group leaders and organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Government to devise an emergency transport plan for the Clondalkin, Lucan and Palmerstown areas in the wake of the go ahead being granted for the M50 widening scheme, including measures to tackle gridlock through traffic management measures, the speeding up of the works on the Dublin-Cork rail line and Heuston interconnector, early investment in electrification and investment in more buses and work towards an integrated cross-Liffey rail link and a Luas link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to immediately roll out the BreastCheck programme to all areas of the country, including the south east and south Tipperary in view of the 1,700 cases of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year and the approximate 640 women who die each year from breast cancer and to allow the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health to make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Government to front load the funding of the western rail corridor to ensure that Mayo is not deprived any longer of this essential railroad <Col N="620"/>infrastructure and can benefit from the western rail corridor from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the series of attacks on Jewish property in the Portobello area where racist graffiti consisting of swastikas and SS signs were sprayed on Jewish landmarks, the fact that this was the third such attack in recent months and the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Having considered the matters raised, I do not consider them to be in order under Standing Order 31.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 12<i>a</i>, motion regarding ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No 19, Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); No. 20, Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed) and No. 21, Land Bill 2004 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (resumed). It is proposed that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 12<i>a</i> shall be decided without debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is one proposal to put to the House, the motion regarding the ministerial rota for parliamentary questions. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children expect the Cabinet to deal with the issue of the terminal at Dublin Airport next week? I note the comments made by the chairman of the Competition Authority, Mr. John Fingleton, that Government intervention is the greatest barrier to competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Deputy Kenny have a question that is appropriate to the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Mr. Fingleton argued that the State should stop preventing people from entering markets. Does the Government intend to change the Competition Authority to deal with that restriction upon competition entering the market? With regard to the e-mail regarding the former Minister of Health and Children, Deputy M&iacute;cheal Martin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="621"/>
    
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The question arises on the Order of Business. Does the Government intend to amend the Public Service Management Act, 1997 in view of the fact that the Minister accepts no responsibility for the debacle foisted upon the Irish people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The House cannot discuss the possible content of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister does not accept any responsibility despite the fact that it is contained in the Public Service Management Act. I consider myself very lucky that he did not have to cast his vote this morning and vote against his colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has no plans to amend the Public Service Management Act. Our competition law has been greatly enhanced in recent years but must be kept under constant review. I hope the Government will be in a position shortly to make a decision regarding the terminal at Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste give the House an approximate figure for the anticipated payout under the redress scheme for long-stay charges? Approximately how much will be paid out this year? What investigation is going on inside the Department of Health and Children following the discovery that the critical file from the Attorney General was being squatted on by the previous Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s question does not arise on the Order of Business. There is no provision for Leaders&rsquo; Questions on Thursday mornings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The entire controversy pivots around the missing file from the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That may well be the case but the question does not arise on the Order of Business. Deputy Rabbitte must find another way of raising the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We now find that the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy M&iacute;cheal Martin, squatted on this file. I am seeking to ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a situation every morning whereby leaders of parties have an opportunity to submit a leader&rsquo;s question. The Chair is here to implement the Standing Orders and as the Chair has pointed out <Col N="622"/>repeatedly in the past, if Deputy Rabbitte wishes to change the Standing Orders, he should set about doing so and the Chair will be happy to implement the new Standing Orders. Standing Order 26 covers the Order of Business and the Chair cannot allow one Deputy to go outside that and insist that other Deputies obey it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Since 1919, it has been possible to ask a question as the leader of a party on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Standing Orders have been implemented by my predecessors since the foundation of the State. In recent years, Leaders&rsquo; Questions were established to facilitate what Deputy Rabbitte wishes to do now. We will not have this argument every morning of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>A senior civil servant at assistant principal level&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has ruled that Deputy Rabbitte is out of order. I call on Deputy Rabbitte to resume his seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is impossible to carry out our business in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not advisable to get into a confrontation with the Chair this morning. The Chair will be obliged to take the necessary action if Deputy Rabbitte persists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the cost, it depends on the level of take-up, particularly by estates but the lower figure that has been estimated by the Department is &euro;845 million. A figure of approximately &euro;1.2 billion or &euro;1.3 billion has been estimated by the Health Service Executive. It is in that ballpark, which is why I have used a figure of approximately &euro;1 billion which is somewhere between the two. I do not think the legislation will be passed until the autumn so I think the bulk of it will be paid next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any investigation going on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a major reorganisation of the Department. It has a new Secretary General. Considerable effort was spent trying to locate that famous file from the Attorney General but it has yet to be found. I do not have it in my possession.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Promised legislation will be published in due course, after which the Government is expected to take action on the terms of that legislation. Is there any point in anticipating the outcome of the decision concerning the Prisons Bill 2005, which accounts for the closure of Mountjoy Prison, considering that &euro;30 million has already <Col N="623"/>been spent on a site by the Government pending the legislation?</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.2-?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there any point in that legislation being treated seriously given that the Government has acted as if it is already an Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the T&aacute;naiste to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Prisons Bill 2005 is ordered for Second Stage. If the State did not need to get involved in public tendering, perhaps the Government could make private land deals and get land as cheaply as everyone else. We must go to the market and advertise, which happened in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>This was not normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It was normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s point, the Government has promised competition in bus services. Senator Mary O&rsquo;Rourke, when she was Minister, was to have produced legislation in 2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is in competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>She is in hot competition. This legislation is now listed as No. 79 on the programme with the statement that its date of publication is not possible to indicate at this stage. What has happened to the Government&rsquo;s views? I know the Senator had strong support for competition but it appears to have left the agenda.</P>
      <P>In a recent court case, &euro;2.2 million was awarded to an individual who was wrongly detained in a mental health institution. When will the tribunals that were promised by legislation be established to deal with cases wherein people feel they have been wrongly treated in mental health institutions? They are sorely overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, informs me the Bill will be introduced later this year.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy&rsquo;s view about the mental health tribunals. They have not been established because the consultants have not been prepared to participate. When we have a sufficient number of psychiatrists willing to participate on the panels, the work will begin immediately concerning the 600 people who were involuntarily detained. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, is working to try to make this a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste give the House a timeframe?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="624"/>
    
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>We need at least 50 to 60 psychiatrists to participate but do not yet have anywhere near that many. Work is ongoing to achieve this target over the next few weeks.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2005: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P Just="Left">Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have devoted a great deal of time to Second Stage which shows that politicians love to talk about the mechanics of politics. It is right that we should discuss the make-up of our constituencies but I hope we do not neglect the other more important issues of the day in this House.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of great interest to me in two respects, in my role as a Deputy representing Dublin North-Central and also a chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. My constituency is set to lose a seat if this Bill is passed as it stands. Although I deeply regret the fact that the people of Dublin North-Central will be forced to relinquish a public representative as the number of <Col N="629"/>seats in the constituency is reduced from four to three, I am happy in the knowledge that this will happen as the result of clear, methodical and pragmatic analysis.</P>
      <P>Dublin North-Central has a long history of boundary changes and adjustments in the number of its seats. Since it was established in 1947, Dublin North-Central has lost or gained a seat three times, switching from three to four seats at each revision. My constituents have accepted these alternations given that they were fair and justified. I know they will agree to the amendments currently proposed. The changes which are to be enacted stem from the advice given by an impartial panel and are necessary, in particular, because of the nature of our democracy.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been attacked by Members of the House as being &ldquo;flawed and undemocratic&rdquo;. I refer to comments made by Deputy Finian McGrath when speaking on Second Stage in the House on 27 April 2005. The Deputy also said the Bill shows a &ldquo;lack of respect for citizens&rdquo;. I argue that the case is precisely the opposite. The method of election here, of which all Members present are well aware, is proportional representation. This means that any election result is directly related to the size of the population. Therefore, to keep the system as democratic as possible, the Government must take responsive action, having regard to population changes.</P>
      <P>The Electoral Commission stated its intention to give particular attention to those constituencies &ldquo;with variances exceeding 5% from national average representation&rdquo;. As it stands, the percentage variance from the national average representation in Dublin North-Central is minus 11.89%. This Bill will address this huge disparity by bringing it to within 4% and will also allow bordering constituencies to be brought further into line with the national average such that Dublin North-Central, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-West &mdash; I note the presence of one of the Deputies respecting the later constituency, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern &mdash; will be well within 1% of the average.</P>
      <P>The knock-on effect of this is that other parts of the country will also benefit from revision and the net result will be a more balanced democracy. We cannot ignore the importance of this. It is imperative that we have a fluid political system that is open to such change which is now being facilitated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in this Bill. If we did not allow for such change, and welcome it, then the system would become static and we would be justified in labelling it undemocratic for it would not successfully reflect the wishes of the population as intended. To ignore population change is to pave the way forward for an unbalanced degree of influence on the part of the electors and, at the extreme end of the scale, the development of something like the infamous &ldquo;rotten borough&rdquo;, a term loaded with notions of <Col N="630"/>misconduct and one which, thankfully, has never been associated with this State.</P>
      <P>Dublin North-Central has been a four seat constituency since 1980. Much has changed in the past 25 years and notably it is one of only three constituencies in the country to have lost population since the 1996 census. I welcome the commission&rsquo;s recommendation to alter the boundaries of the constituency accordingly.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to study what is happening in Dublin North-Central. Many Members present would be surprised to learn that the population of a Dublin constituency quite close to the River Liffey is declining. Many elderly people live in many estates in the constituency. Young people from the area who leave the family home, get married and set up house are moving to the suburbs of Dublin North, County Meath and so on. It is a pattern with which we are familiar. It allows us to examine further the population changes and to plan accordingly. We are all familiar with the problem of suburban sprawl. Those who canvassed in the Meath by-election in particular had this message clearly brought home to them. We must examine how we can attract population back into the centre city areas and into the inner city suburbs. A policy of high density development is being facilitated which I welcome in some respects. Nevertheless, we must be careful in our planning that we do not destroy the traditional neighbourhood communities which have characterised Dublin North-Central and neighbouring constituencies over the years. That is a digression from the subject of the Bill, but there are major planning issues arising from the population changes currently taking place.</P>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the current system of revising constituencies through the advice of an independent commission, alteration was at the discretion of a Minister. We are all aware of the problems that this method brought in its train. One Minister had the dishonour of being added to the political lexicon as a result of his attempts to gerrymander constituencies in what he believed to be in favour of his Government. His attempts failed spectacularly, hence the term &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo;. But at least some good came of his actions when an independent commission was established to address constituency change.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that while the system then in place was quite obviously open to charges of malpractice, such charges applied to the system we have today serve only to scar the reputation of this House in the eyes of the citizens of this country and the international community. This is a needless and disruptive practice, and any argument put forward in this debate that is built on the principle that this legislation is undemocratic is inherently weak. To accuse an independent commission of conspiring to gerrymander is undermining and bruising to our democracy. A Bill of this type will inevitably come under attack from elements in the Opposition benches. Their arguments are rarely new and are never founded <Col N="631"/>on an objective and pragmatic analysis of the issues.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times</i> recently published an article on this legislation entitled New electoral boundaries will make or break some careers.  I suspect this encapsulates the fears of some of those Deputies who attacked this legislation as being driven by so-called anti-democratic values. If they were genuinely concerned for the well-being of our electoral system, they would not be reduced to such unhelpful and unwarranted attacks. We have an electoral system in place in this country which is the envy of less fortunate countries across the globe. It must be treated with respect and managed carefully so that it retains its stature. This Bill ensures that it does and I commend it to the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to make a final point. In 2007, all going well, my family will have given 50 years of public service to the people of Dublin North-Central. The reduction of seats in this constituency from four to three will make it very competitive for all candidates contesting the next general election. The electorate will decide who will be returned to Leinster House. I hope the people of Dublin North-Central will re-elect me as one of their three Deputies to allow me to continue to represent them effectively to the best of my ability for the duration of the 30th D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which will form the basis for the conduct of the upcoming general election, which may occur in one or two years.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes a total of 43 constituencies, one more than the previous constituency revision, but without any increase in the number of Deputies to be elected to the D&aacute;il, which remains at 166. Given that the population has increased by approximately 25% in the past 15 years, it might be an appropriate time to consider increasing the number of Deputies to 168. Some people may feel there are too many of us, but that is life.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a total of 12 five-seat constituencies, 13 four-seat constituencies and 18 three-seat constituencies. As Deputy Haughey said, it is a new feature that we are beginning to increase the number of three-seat constituencies. Nevertheless, even though the overall number of D&aacute;il Deputies will remain the same, the Bill will have the effect of changing considerably the political landscape. It allows for a more sweeping revision of constituency boundaries than many previous revisions. It changes 23 constituencies, leaving 15 unchanged, creates five new constituencies and replaces four existing ones.</P>
      <P>Electoral systems are a significant part of the web of legal and civil institutions that societies construct to govern themselves. In the early years of the State, multi-member constituencies were not uncommon, with as many as six and seven members from each constituency. For the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, multi-seat <Col N="632"/>constituencies are the norm, with six and seven members elected in most areas. During the recent election in Northern Ireland we witnessed, on the one hand, six and seven seat constituencies and, on the other, the one man one vote system, which lead to tactical voting. This does not allow people to vote for the individuals they want. Proportional representation is the purest form of representation in that it ensures that Deputies are elected more or less in proportion to the number of votes cast for each party grouping.</P>
      <P>The first D&aacute;il adopted a system of multi-member constituencies, returning as many as eight and nine Deputies, and it ensured that the widest cross section of interests were represented in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The original intentions of the nation-builders in the 1920s was not to design a system that would be applied to a vast majority of three-seat constituencies. The independent electoral commission&rsquo;s hands were tied by the Government&rsquo;s stipulation that constituencies were to be confined to three, four and five-seat constituencies. It could not have decided to return to six-seat constituencies. The electoral commission also has in its terms of reference the stipulation that there should be an average representation of one Deputy per 22,598 people. This is subject to a 5% deviation either way and that county boundaries would be adhered to as far as possible.</P>
      <P>County loyalty is still very strong throughout the country. The electoral commission members followed the county boundary stipulation as far as possible in the past. Unfortunately, the tendency towards a proliferation of three-seat constituencies leads to a gross distortion of PR, since a disproportionate number of Deputies, two out of three, is frequently returned as against the votes cast. The effect of such a multiplicity of three-seat constituencies is to minimise the number of minority Deputies elected. A truer reflection of voters&rsquo; preferences would emerge from a general election if there were 20 five-seat, 12 four-seat and six three-seat constituencies.</P>
      <P>The original purpose of the PR system was to return a correct proportion of Deputies from the various parties as close as possible to the proportions of the votes cast for the various party groups. It has been said that PR makes every vote count and produces results that are proportionate to what the voters desire. Experience has shown that proportional representation has produced successful governments less ignorant to citizens&rsquo; needs. Accordingly, citizens become less apathetic and more content with the way the system works. It has proved itself to be the most dependable method of electing Deputies to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, even though its effectiveness has been steadily eroded down the years by the reduction of constituency representation. Even though the 23 female Members of the House is a long way short of what it should be, PR encourages women to have a greater representation in our Parliament compared with the British system.</P><Col N="633"/>
      
      <P>The skewed results that emanate from a preponderance of three-seat constituencies depart radically from the spirit and purpose of PR. They provide results that are frequently at variance with the voters&rsquo; intentions. How can 66% of the seats in an area that are won with 47% of votes cast be construed as representing the democratic will of the people of the area? The number of three-seat constituencies continues to grow, diminishing the proportional nature of the electoral system and getting as close as possible to the effect of a system of single member constituencies.</P>
      <P>The proportional nature of the system has been largely diluted by the proposal to split County Leitrim down the middle. Leitrim is being divided between counties Sligo and Roscommon to form two new constituencies of Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim. It is quite conceivable that we could get back to the situation that prevailed in the 1970s when Leitrim was similarly divided between Roscommon and Sligo. I listened to Deputy Ellis who was very eloquent in dealing with this matter. I would not be surprised if he is re-elected in his constituency. He spoke very well and made a very strong case. At the time there was not a single Deputy from County Leitrim elected in either constituency and the people of the county were effectively disenfranchised for several years until the county was reunited in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Shifts in population require that constituency boundaries be redrawn from time to time to reflect the population shifts reported in the census. According to the recent census in 2002, Ireland has a population of just over 3.9 million. It also reported dramatic differences in the rate of population growth in different areas of the country. We all know there is a leaning towards the east coast and that the population is not increasing to the same extent in rural areas. This is because of the failure of our decentralisation programme. If we are to increase the population in certain areas, we should reconsider decentralisation, promote industry and create jobs in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The manipulation of constituency boundaries in the past used to be known as gerrymandering. There are several notorious examples of efforts to secure party advantage in the House practised by different Governments. Gerrymandering was the political weapon of choice. Its main purposes were to protect the seats of incumbent Deputies and to allow the dominant party to win more seats than it deserved. There were opportunities for Governments to gain a few extra seats for themselves.</P>
      <P>The overall number of Deputies has been fixed by law at between 164 and 168. I made reference to the need to consider increasing this number. The electoral commission, which adheres strictly to its terms of reference, has been cited as the reason we have not had overall majorities for over 25 years.</P><Col N="634"/>
      
      <P>In the United Kingdom&rsquo;s first-past-the-post system, minority groups are either left out or under-represented and the overall results merely provide an illusion of political consensus. The first-past-the-post system produces serious distortions that are remedied by a PR system. In the United Kingdom, for example, the former Liberal Party, now the Liberal Democrats, frequently polled over 30% of the votes cast in the country, yet returned with a paltry 11 or 12 seats out of 630.</P>
      <P>The claim that winner-takes-all elections are inherently more capable of bridging political divides does not bear up under scrutiny. Such is the main fallacy of the single-member constituency, be it in the British first-past-the-post system or our by-election system, in which just one person is elected by the single transferable vote.</P>
      <P>The single-member constituency would put independent or minority candidates at an extreme disadvantage in the face of the massive machines of major parties. I have no doubt that many in this House would like to see this happen. I listened to one gentleman from Mayo yesterday who would be absolutely delighted if there were a way of getting rid of Independents. Independents have a place in this D&aacute;il. We are well established here and raise relevant issues, to the extent that major political parties sometimes adopt those issues as their own a week later. Independent voices are being heard and make an impression in the D&aacute;il. The establishment of single-member constituencies would have the effect of minimising the number of Deputies from smaller parties or Independents in the House.</P>
      <P>One of the most common criticisms of the PR system concerns its instability. The repeated collapse of the rather shaky coalitions in Israel and Italy creates policy uncertainty and doubts about their governments&rsquo; long-term viability. The principal problem with PR is that it tends to entrench in power the leadership of the major parties. For most of the half century after the Second World War, no matter how the Italian voters twisted or turned, they found themselves ruled by a government dominated by Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party. Governments fell routinely but the same cast of candidates continued to shuffle Cabinet chairs and to ramble on as before. The end came with the emergence of a regionally dominant business-friendly party that ran on an anti-corruption campaign. However, PR made it harder rather than easier to turf out the broadly unwanted governing parties.</P>
      <P>Another drawback of the PR system is the quality of policy choices made by cohabiting governing parties. This is a dynamic problem. A junior coalition partner that supports the dominant party&rsquo;s position may find itself readily forgotten and electorally unrewarded. Hence, the current policy divergence between the current Government partners over the provision of a second terminal at Dublin Airport. In another country, the very suggestion that such a difference could be <Col N="635"/>responsible for the downfall of a government would be regarded as ludicrous.</P>
      <P>Our population of 3.9 million is at its highest since the great famine. Consequently, one would think an addition to the number of seats in the D&aacute;il is warranted. However, the electoral commission was probably gauging public opinion in balancing population shifts with the current 166 D&aacute;il seats.</P>
      <P>Many have argued in favour of having fewer Deputies and various maximum numbers of seats, ranging from 60 to 100, have been advocated. Some argue that democracy would benefit if fewer Deputies, who would be suitably qualified and more highly paid, were elected. However, who would determine what is meant by &ldquo;suitably qualified&rdquo;? As the only Independent Deputy for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I do not subscribe to the idea.</P>
      <P>Our public representatives are readily accessible to their constituents, irrespective of whether they voted for them. In an effort to bring democracy closer to the people, I intend to make myself as available as possible in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. I have taken the initial steps to increase the number of locations in which I hold clinics. I am doing so in County Monaghan initially and when this is done I will re-examine my position on holding clinics in County Cavan.</P>

This is what Members of the Oireachtas are paid for. I also hold a clinic in Carrickmacross at 4 p.m. on the first Thursday of every month.</P>
      <P>My idea was so good that a major political party decided the very next week to run clinics every first Saturday. Is it a case of great minds or fools thinking alike? I was glad I was the first to have this good idea because otherwise I could have been accused of copying it. Maybe the people will realise I have set this trend. It will change the face of politics in County Monaghan. <Col N="636"/>It is very important to locate one&rsquo;s office where the people are.</P>
      <P>It is only in recent times that politicians have thought it worth their while to open offices in local towns. It is a new way and circumstances have changed. In the past, clinics were sporadic and constituents did not know exactly when they would be held. They had to watch the paper like a hawk to find out. Now they know they can meet a politician in a given place at a given time. This is why we are elected.</P>

	<P>We are well-paid for it and this is how it should be.</P>
      <P>Consider the issue of people who do not bother to vote. They have different reasons. Some feel they are too much above voting to bother sullying themselves with the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are basking in their own reflected glory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>Others feel they are making a stand against the system and getting their own back by not voting. Perhaps the political parties are guilty to the extent that they do not recruit new members. Recruitment is almost a forgotten art. I cannot accuse every party of not recruiting new members but many of the major parties ignore the public. If one asks why someone joined a party he or she will say it was the only party that invited him or her. When one joins a party one is indoctrinated, to an extent. That is how the party operates. The member enjoys the tap on the shoulder and the feeling that in the party&rsquo;s eyes he or she is special.</P>
      <P>Many people have a very low opinion of politicians in general, whether that be right or wrong. There may be many reasons for that. People are surprised to hear that, like schoolchildren, we get our summer holidays at the beginning of July. The perception is that we are a group of self-serving people. I am not unique in working here for a minimum of 90 hours a week, but that message is not delivered to the people. It would not sell newspapers. It is easy to criticise the system and we are the butt of that criticism and that will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>If people who do not vote understood what some people have done to win the vote they would appreciate that right. For example, there was a time when women did not have the right to vote or to education. In 1913, Emily Wilding Davison threw herself in front of the king&rsquo;s horse and died in order to win the vote for women.</P>

	<P>In states that did not have the franchise people walked for days and queued in <Col N="637"/>the sun to win votes. A referendum in 1972 reduced the voting age here from 21 to 18 years.</P>
      <P>We should consider introducing Sunday voting. It has proved successful elsewhere so why not adopt it here? If we persist in holding elections on a Friday one central electoral station should be designated in each major university city, such as Galway, Cork or Dublin, to facilitate students on the day of the election. When students return home on a bus or train on a Friday evening they are not thinking about the election. They may have family, sporting or social commitments. They are tired after a hard week&rsquo;s work and look forward to socialising when they come home at the weekends.</P>
      <P>No debate on electoral reform would be complete without a reference to the electronic voting system. The mishandling of its introduction was such that people will shy away from using the system. Equipment worth &euro;50 million is in storage and continues to cost us money. We should revisit that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill. Many constituencies and boundaries have been changed which adds to the intrigue and the difficulties facing political parties and candidates. This is particularly so in my constituency of Cork North West which will be one of the most interesting and complex constituencies in the next election.</P>
      <P>We have reviewed constituencies since the foundation of the State and will continue to do so. All the reports of the independent constituency commission have been accepted.</P>
      <P>Many people believe proportional representation and the multi-seat constituency make the election too constituency and client-orientated. The other side of that argument is that candidates grow close to the needs of people in their constituencies. After a weekend in their constituency clinics and advice offices they understand the pertinent issues. A single seat constituency might suit a sitting Deputy or politician but proportional representation is probably the best system for the general public. The most important aspect of an <Col N="638"/>election is to ensure people have representation and our system is conducive to achieving that representation.</P>
      <P>Politics is over-analysed and has become a global phenomenon. Previous speakers have said how difficult it is to attract new people into politics. In recent years we have seen a decline in voter turnout at elections across the spectrum, whether the election is held on a Thursday or Friday. Holding elections on a Sunday would make no difference because people are becoming detached from politics and politicians, which is to the detriment of all parties.</P>
      <P>I spoke recently to a group of young people and asked their views of politics. They regard politics as remote from their lives. In 1975 Jack Lynch, then leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, set up the first youth organisation of any political party, &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il. In his opening speech he said &ldquo;whether it be to join and support or indeed to strongly oppose us, we in Fianna F&aacute;il exhort each and every young person in this State to become involved in political organisations&rdquo;. We must spread this message. All politicians discuss politics with civics, social and political education classes in second level schools. They probably lay out their stalls there too, as we all must do in advance of an election. The most important job we can do is to encourage young people to participate in the democratic process and to understand that their contribution can influence policy.</P>
      <P>Ireland is a rich country whose identity has developed over years of upheaval yet we have a tradition of creativity and culture. To share our opinions on politics or on any subject we must be informed and the great interest in politics through the generations is testament to the excellent standard of education in this country over the past century. Consideration of policies and politics tests each of us and broadens our understanding of people&rsquo;s behaviour, thus making us more broad-minded and creating a more inclusive and progressive society.</P>
      <P>To play our part in politics we must understand them. Young people and people generally across the country associate politics, electoral Bills and elections with politicians being elected to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and various local authorities throughout the country but politics is about life. For the past eight years I have been honoured to be a Member of this House representing Cork North-West. The more I see of life here the more I see that it mirrors life throughout the country. One has the same characters in this House that one has in any community. They are representative of Irish life and true proportional representation in any parliament should mirror life outside it. That is the function of the national parliament.</P>
      <P>If we consider any community, life, events and the environment will continuously test its beliefs. History teaches us that in striving for an ideal many obstacles must be overcome. Policy makers must find compromise and dialogue must be used <Col N="639"/>as the ultimate tool in the resolution of difficulties. Some people have great enthusiasm and ambition and great ideas come from this. Though they may not want to talk about their opinions, many people have an idea of the Ireland in which they want to live. This vision is based primarily on people&rsquo;s lives and has been formulated by families, school, environment and the part they play in the local community. In politics or personal life the key to success is to play an important role in the development of one&rsquo;s community. This may be in the sporting, musical or party political domain. Through such involvement everyone will develop their interpersonal skills and learn from those around them.</P>
      <P>Young people bring blind enthusiasm that often makes the impossible possible. That great enthusiasm can rejuvenate an organisation and reawaken an entire community. Involvement in any organisation is character-building while complacency creates a dormant society, without progress or hope. Throughout this country we should sell this notion to everyone. I could list the community groups in my own constituency that have done excellent work on behalf of their community. Consider the people at the forefront of development of the community or organisations. These people are great leaders and we should encourage people to get involved in their own communities and local organisations. Through that they take pride in their organisations.</P>
      <P>I sometimes become disillusioned when I hear that it is a terrible country to live in, or that some community is a terrible one in which to live. This kind of statement makes me angry. It is easy to be the hurler on the ditch, taking a swipe at anyone who is leading in his or her community or organisation. It is easy to say that he or she should do things differently. The most important thing is to get people involved because everyone&rsquo;s ideas are needed. One can take a cynical view of anything and say that nothing can be changed. Anyone involved in politics can make a change and can state what he or she would like for the community. Getting involved in a political party leads to friendships being made and being broken. A leading politician in this House, who had been secretary of the local GAA club at one time said that he had created more enemies as secretary of his GAA club than in 20 years of national politics. That may be partially true.</P>
      <P>My constituency, Cork North-West, is predominantly rural. In 1997 media commentators said that it was one of the forgotten constituencies. There was never media focus on it. Alas, that will not happen this time even though we might like if it did happen. There will be plenty of activity. The constituency stretches from Rockchapel, Milford and Charleville through to Ballincollig, which will be included in the constituency as part of this Bill. There is a broad cross-section of people. Major developments have taken place over the past eight years. Like any rural constitu<Col N="640"/>ency it has changed with the advent of the Celtic Tiger and with new people moving in.</P>
      <P>One of the most important things that happened in Cork North-West over the past eight years is the change in the employment rate. Ten or 15 years ago young people educated in my constituency had to emigrate to Liverpool, Boston or New York to find a job. Thankfully that is no longer the case and the situation is reversed. Non-nationals are coming to the area to find work in this community. Despite the non-nationals coming in the number of people on the live register is decreasing further. People say that 20 years ago if we could see a situation of full employment for our people we would never again see a poor day. However, with full employment we have other pressures.</P>
      <P>One issue that arises in rural constituencies, and particularly my own, is planning permission, and planning for young people living there. We have provided employment for them and it is important for all local and national politicians to ensure that policies are implemented so that young people can build homes in their local communities. It is important that some regulations regarding rural planning are not interpreted in a very strict manner. In my parish there were 76 more family homes than there are today. If someone built 76 more homes tomorrow dotted around the countryside the planning authorities would almost have a seizure. Now that we have secured employment we must allow people to stay in their communities and it is important that we provide planning for them in rural areas.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>In the by-elections in Meath and Kildare we saw the huge suburban growth of Dublin. Over the past ten years the population of Dublin has doubled. I wonder whether communities are being put in place for all the houses that have been built. People become attached to their community if there is a strong sense of community. Traditionally our society has been based on a strong sense of community to which people have a strong attachment. It is important to have a strong sense of community, otherwise all we have are housing estates.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.2-?>
      <P>In the west and in much of my constituency there are small rural towns and villages that have the ability to take extra houses given that the nucleus of sporting facilities and schools are in place. Planners should take those issues into consideration.</P>
      <P>A major issue in all constituencies is the provision of child care facilities. Many of the community-funded child care projects had a three-year staffing grant. However, staff costs have escalated and they now have a deficit and will not be able to continue to operate. I am aware the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is reviewing community-based projects. It is important that it considers the issue seriously and increases its contribution. As the Government has provided funding to the tune of &euro;1.5 million <Col N="641"/>for various projects, we must ensure that funding is provided to ensure staffing for these projects.</P>
      <P>I have been chairman of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il for the past seven years during which time we have had many discussions with young people who have been turned off politics. When one visits any college campus, one has a great recruitment day during freshers&rsquo; week. Like all the political parties, we move in the machine and try to get as many as possible signed up to the organisation. During the year, fewer turn up at meetings. Sometimes people become cynical of politics. At times we jump on the bandwagon in a constituency when an announcement is made. We may have criticised the particular project for some time but, when it is announced, we say we played a major part in it. We create some of the reasons people are cynical with politics.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme was discussed on the media this morning. I am pleased that the decision by the Government on decentralisation, 18 months ago, is progressing well. In the case of Kanturk, County Cork, a site has been identified. We have promoted this issue from day one. Ireland is not a huge sprawling nation with millions of acres of land but a small nation in which we can communicate and run our businesses effectively whether in Kanturk, Knock or Dublin 4. If units of the apparatus of State are based in small provincial towns, one gets a cross-section of views rather than the Dublin understanding of what is needed. I welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to proceed with the decentralisation programme and to identify sites in all 53 locations. I am pleased it has identified a site and has agreed a sum of money with the landowner in regard to Kanturk, County Cork. I urge the Government to ensure decentralisation will become a reality.</P>
      <P>Like many Deputies before, it has been my privilege and honour to represent Cork North-West in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for almost eight years. Let us hope the people of Cork North-West will put their faith in me again at the next general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last occasion the boundary commission visited my constituency, it left it in such a way that I had great difficulty in getting elected afterwards. Hopefully, it will not be as difficult on the next occasion. However, that is what happens with commission boundaries in every country. It is part of the democratic system and sometimes one falls on the right side of the line and sometimes not. Fortunately we have an independent commission which I hope will continue to be independent. I respect its decisions. However, I was not as welcoming on the previous occasion for the simple reason that it had obvious implications for me.</P>
      <P>In general, I welcome the Bill although I have a number of reservations. Other speakers have referred to the public perception of politics and politicians. For a variety of reasons it has become fashionable to criticise politicians and to presume every public representative is in some way corrupt, semi-corrupt, about to be or has been corrupted. I do not agree with that nor do I accept that kind of criticism. The majority of public representatives are honest, hard-working and dedicated individuals and contribute a great deal of time to democracy and serving the needs of their constituents. It may be that sometimes the needs of constituents are difficult to satisfy. In the nature of things, some are impossible. As a result, it is possible for the public to get the notion that we are deficient in the way we do our work. The majority of public representatives and Members have in the past given of their time, energy and service in a selfless way.</P>
      <P>In many other professions in Ireland, Europe and throughout the world, there are those who have erred and fallen by the wayside in at least as grievous a way as any of the Members who fell by the wayside from this House. It covers all professions. One does not condemn all professions because of the wrongs of one or two individuals. It is no harm to remind everybody once in a while that some of us try to work as hard as <Col N="643"/>we can for the reasons we were elected, which is to serve our constituencies and to legislate.</P>
      <P>There is a notion in the thinking quarters that a legislator should be ensconced in a glass case where he or she has no dealings with the public and that they should legislate from that vantage point. I disagree unequivocally with that view. Other speakers made the point that meeting their constituents on a regular basis is the best inspiration there will ever be for legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no other way to evaluate the impact of legislation passed by this House other than by going and meeting the people regularly and finding out how legislation as passed by this House affects them. It all comes down to the way the legislation affects the individual. One of the problems arising in recent years is the degree to which that old tradition of meeting the people on a regular basis is beginning to dim. Some people believe that it influences public representatives in a negative way but I do not agree. The public will always respond to their representatives and tell them what they think. It may not always be what we want to hear but they will always tell us.</P>
      <P>I wonder why young people do not hold politicians in high esteem. There is no need to ask that question and I regret the Minister of State at the Department for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has left the Chamber. The housing situation is a classic case. The young generation relied on the political system to deliver the goods to them. They are quite willing to co-operate and make an effort to assist themselves. Down the years politicians were able to encourage the younger generation, the first-time house buyer, to buy their own homes but this is no longer the case. They have been virtually excluded from the system. The waiting lists are massive, with at least 100,000 waiting. The lists are growing in every county. This is an absolute disgrace and a shame on the system which has allowed it to happen.</P>
      <P>A previous speaker referred to young people seeking planning permission in rural areas. It is deemed to be almost a nasty thing to suggest looking for planning permission in a rural area because, according to some pundits, nobody should be living in a rural area as these are gardens which should be preserved for certain people to take a walk on a Sunday and observe the local inhabitants in their natural habitat. I do not agree with that notion. There has always been a tradition of a rural population and any interference with that tradition is interfering with the normal and natural evolution of the rural population. There are those who believe a hillside at night should have no lights visible. It has been stated unequivocally by Professor Caulfield that lights on a rural hillside are a sign of life and a sign that emigration is not as rife as it was.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a sign of revival and of hope for the future. I take no advice from any quarter on that issue because I was born and raised in a rural area. I do not wish to see a situation as pertained in eastern Europe when the communists took over after the Second World War. They scooped all the people out of the rural areas and built tower blocks for them beside the cities and towns in order to control them. I see a little of that attitude beginning to emerge in this country and I do not like it.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the PR system. I believe in the PR system. It is the finest possible method for achieving democracy. I do not agree with the notion that it should be further refined and improved because this has been done in the past. Many commentators question the reason people do not vote and I can suggest a reason.

	<P>I remind the Deputy they did a lot of other funny things. The Government decided to ban people from congregating outside polling stations, the reason being that modern voters did not want unclean and unwashed groups of rednecks outside the polling stations interfering with their natural process. The result was that people did not turn out to vote. One of the main reasons people went to vote at polling stations was because the occasion was like a football match. It was part of our tradition and part of the system. A Fianna F&aacute;il guy and a Fine Gael guy could have a great time in a pub together one night and then have a go at each other at the polling station in front of everybody else, to the general jollification of the multitudes there assembled. One cannot tell that story to some of the bright-thinking individuals who now represent big brother&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not use the word &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;. They are thinkers.</P>
      <P>There was a ritual of going down to the polling station and having a go at one&rsquo;s next-door neighbour and the same people were quite happy to go to the pub the following night and it was all forgotten.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Funnily enough, they had a go at each other as well. The fact they were Pioneers did not inhibit their capacity to have a go at each other and they did so on many occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The theory was that polling day was a day for politics and democracy, a day for the ritual big occasion in which everybody was involved. I ask that this notion of measuring the distance from the polling station be scrapped.</P>
      <P>At the first election held following this rule, we had to search for the polling stations. I know the stations in my constituency and I know the ones where Deputy Se&aacute;n Power did well, but I had to look around for them because there were no crowds outside. The spectacle and ritual of the occasion was done away with.</P>
      <P>I cannot allow the occasion pass without referring to this awful debacle of electronic voting. This is a classic example where it was decided to improve democracy and improve the voting system that had served us well since the foundation of the State. Like those who attempted to improve the roundness of the wheel, so far the net benefits have not been visible to anybody. Only one system of voting should be allowed, where the voter goes into the polling station and puts their mark on the paper, as happens in democracies all over the world. If an electronic voting system was introduced in some emerging democracies, we would immediately hold up our hands and warn the system was open to abuse because it lacks transparency, accountability, a paper trail and verification. It is impossible to invent technology that is sufficiently foolproof.</P>
      <P>I refer to the Order Paper of this House and the electronic scramble of Members&rsquo; names for parliamentary questions. On one occasion I counted five Members whose questions appeared consecutively on the Order Paper. The same Deputy had Questions Nos. 35 and 36, another Deputy had Questions Nos. 37 and 38, and another Deputy had Questions Nos. 40 and 42. This should not happen because I am informed the odds are 500 million to one of this happening in the electronic system.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to cut out this nonsense of keeping electronic voting equipment in storage all over the country &mdash; all the equipment is not stored yet. This is in anticipation of the big event which will be hugely costly. The electronic equipment will soon be out of date and it will not work. This was pointed out by the Opposition. Someone must call a halt to the nonsense of spending public money without consultation and in the knowledge that it could not succeed. It is amazing that nobody has accepted responsibility. Nobody has resigned and nobody has been fired.</P>
      <P>They may think otherwise but I have the height of respect for Independent Members. It has happened that people disagree with their party and become Independent Members. This is a democracy and it is their right to do so. Whichever Government is in power, it loves having many Independent Members because it takes the focus away from the Opposition parties. It clearly indicates what the Independents are, which is independent. It gives members of the public a way to <Col N="646"/>salve their conscience at election time because they can claim not to have voted for the Government and voted for an Independent instead who may be neither in the Government nor in the Opposition. Some Independents will occasionally vote with the Government and at other times vote with the Opposition. Other Independents will always vote with either the Government or the Opposition. I do not accept the notion that it is necessarily good for the country. I do nothing other than congratulate my colleague recently elected as an Independent in my constituency. If I were in Government, I would love to see more Independent Members elected to the House because I would know the chances of the Government being put out of office would grow slimmer with more Independent Members.</P>
      <P>The Standards in Public Office Commission recommended a change in the legislation resulting in section 6 of the Bill. This change came about as a result of the famous Kelly case which took place the day after the previous general election was called. Mr. Kelly was a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party. Despite the annoyance he caused that party, he subsequently successfully sought a nomination and ran for election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>That is democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree. However, the degree of annoyance expressed by some of his colleagues at the time was significant. However, giving someone a nomination hardly shows annoyance. The amendment introduced by the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government obviously created an anomaly. That the judgment in the Kelly case was delivered the day before the general election meant that all the then serving Members of the House and all the candidates had to go through the election campaign not knowing what the outcome would be. They had a sword of Damocles hanging over their heads for the duration of the election campaign. I do not believe that is democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the least of our concerns during the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il might have had other concerns. However, I will not go down that road. I do not accept that it is good for democracy for something like this to happen. It is one matter for candidates to look over their shoulders and wonder what the outcome of an election might be. It is an entirely different matter if after the election they are faced with the possibility of a change in the rules applying retrospectively, which was the part I found particularly objectionable. This does not mean it might not be necessary to go to the courts to deal with other matters. However, I believe the separation of powers came very close to being breached on that occasion.</P><Col N="647"/>
      
      <P>This amendment inserts a subparagraph clarifying the items which are not to be regarded as election expenses at presidential, D&aacute;il and European elections, including free postage provided for candidates. Presumably this refers to postage paid by political parties or the State. However, it could also refer to postage provided by anybody else. Also included is a service provided free by an individual or provided by an employee of a political party. The Kelly case was based on the outgoing Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas having access to their offices, computers etc., which was deemed to be an unfair advantage. However, many candidates had free access to many offices throughout the country. Some of these offices were vast and huge resources were available.</P>
      <P>Some of us were very fastidious in the way we curtailed our expenditure during the previous general election. I came in at approximately &euro;16,500 in a three-seat constituency and almost lost my seat. All the time we were warned of the danger of exceeding the expenditure levels. When I saw the expenditure declared afterwards by some candidates, I could not see how everybody had complied. However, it was deemed to be compliant, which I could not understand. Certain matters need to be clarified for the future. Also included is normal media coverage. How in the name of God could normal media coverage be included as an election expense? A candidate who tripped and fell could have four or five photographs published as a result, which would be deemed as media coverage that would not be normal. I do not know how somebody gets into a situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>It depends on who pushed the candidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true. The transmission on radio or television of a broadcast on behalf of a candidate or political party is also included. As we live in the 21st century, how could that ever be considered to be part of an electoral expense to be declared? It is part of the normal business we conduct.</P>
      <P>Section 6 should be contained in a separate Bill and should not form part of this legislation. It should be dealt with at length and soon. I would be very upset if it were to transpire that on the day before the next general election, some other enterprising Fianna F&aacute;il candidate had decided to go to the courts on some pretext in an attempt to change the law once again. When we go into the next general election, we need to know beforehand the grounds and conditions on which it will be fought. Let us have no smart-alec changes in the last few days or in the course of the election campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill whose main purpose is revise <Col N="648"/>the D&aacute;il constituencies in the light of the 2002 census and to implement the recommendations contained in the constituency boundary commission&rsquo;s report of 2004. While it is relatively short legislation, it is very important. It will significantly enhance or damage sitting Deputies and candidates in the next general election depending on where they live. As someone who has the honour of representing the constituency of Westmeath that is to be transferred in part into two separate electoral constituencies by the constituency commission, I have probably most to fear by the Bill. I am particularly concerned about the future representation of the people of north Westmeath, whom I have had the pleasure of serving in both Houses of the Oireachtas since 1982.</P>
      <P>When the commission was established, its job was to review the existing constituency boundaries on foot of population trends and to make recommendations for boundary changes based on the national census. It claims to have done this and while a further census of population will be taken next year, the process involved will take too long to permit a new Bill to be introduced before the next general election. I believe the new census will show that the population of Westmeath has increased substantially in recent years, and in the past three years in particular. This population growth will continue as a result of the Government&rsquo;s inward investment in industry and new technology and as a result of substantially improved infrastructure in the county, such as gas, broadband, roads and various other unprecedented improvements we have seen in the county.</P>
      <P>Following the 2002 general election, I am proud to be the only Government Deputy in the county. It is a wonderful time to be in public life, assist my native county and do whatever I can for its people from Athlone to Clonmellon to the bridge of Finea and in Mullingar, Kilbeggan and Coole, areas which are experiencing unprecedented growth. I am absolutely delighted and privileged to be associated with this Government, which is making it all possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>That should go down in the Deputy&rsquo;s election expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Speaking as one who has risen the hard way, working for 45 years to get where I am, making a success of being a businessperson and then entering public life and being able to assist the people of my native county and, like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, having the great honour of wearing the county jersey for a few years, I hope at the end of my five-year term as a Deputy for Westmeath, I will be able to say honestly and without any gimmicks or throwaway one-liners that I have certainly helped make a difference.</P>
      <P>The new census will show that people have come into the county to commute to such places as Dublin and Kildare. Improvements are hap<Col N="649"/>pening in our county. With the economy now in such a good state, buoyant and with no emigration, we can have great sporting success, something seen in our unprecedented victory in the Leinster championship last year. The Bill before the House today has raised a great many issues. At election time we all become aware that people are not on the register although they have voted for many years previously. For one reason or another, through no fault of their own, they have been left off the register. Very many young people who should be on the register are not, especially in areas of increased population where new communities are being established. Entire housing estates are not on the register as they should be.</P>
      <P>Having knocked on doors for perhaps 45 years and served as a postman in early life, I make this proposal for the serious consideration of the Minister. It is reasonable to assume that at least 10% of the electorate is disenfranchised from one election to another because of inaccuracies in the register. I call on the Minister to employ the local postman or postwoman to assemble the initial register for each electoral area. The first person to know that one has moved into an area will be the postman or postwoman rather than the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as we are led to believe. It may not be the doctor, priest or teacher, although the teacher would have a chance with a younger family. The one sure-fire person to know is the postman or postwoman. I know that, if properly remunerated, they would be the best people to assist in assembling the register at election time. I pay tribute to the postal employees in my area who voluntarily assisted us over the years in the north Westmeath and Mullingar area in particular, where I have served for many years.</P>
      <P>I was the Leader of Seanad &Eacute;ireann up to 2002, and a Bill came to the House for our approval regarding opinion polls being banned for seven days before election day. I want to see that section restored to this Bill. A seven to ten day poll ban should include election day. The difficulty with the last section was that election day was not included, as Senator Ross and I noticed at about 10.20 p.m., meaning the Bill had to be reconsidered. That very good and wise section allowed the electorate time for calm consideration of the candidates presented to it by the various parties, as well as the Independents. Why should anyone be allowed to interfere with the democratic system for which people fought? People gave their lives to allow us to exercise our franchise and vote democratically for our choice of candidate. A man or woman who may not have enormous resources should have as good a chance of getting the people&rsquo;s approval as others. I hope the current Minister will consider bringing back that section in the interests of democracy, as did the last Government and the previous Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. As all the parties will agree, there should be time for calm reflec<Col N="650"/>tion so that the electorate can consider the merits of a candidate.</P>
      <P>I will return to the issue of redrawing constituency boundaries. It is not merely politicians who are concerned at the proposed changes. Those who live in the constituencies affected are also extremely concerned, and many of those in north Westmeath, particularly the Coole district, are very upset at the proposal. The commission&rsquo;s decision to transfer the Coole electoral area in north Westmeath to the new constituency of Meath West may well result in there being no resident Deputy to represent it after the next general election. It took the people of Coole in north Westmeath 37 years from 1965 to get one. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is the last Deputy in the House who served with the late M. J. Kennedy. On the day Mr. Kennedy died, 16 February 1965, Se&aacute;n Lemass went to Phoenix Park and called a general election. From 1965 until my election in 2002 the Coole electorate had no representative from any party in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. That is too long for such an unhelpful and unhappy situation to obtain. What is the rural community of north Westmeath to do for another 37 or 40 years? It is totally unfair that the county boundary has once again been breached, so that we have been put in with County Meath. We have no difficulty working with people there, but the issue is of having a representative at the seat of power with access to Ministers, Ministers of State, the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste. That is a massive advantage for an electoral area.</P>
      <P>I will list my achievements, humble as they are: the new stand-alone community college in Castlepollard, which has just been opened; a new, one-stop shop facility, with 14 staff from Westmeath County Council, in Castlepollard; a new fire station; and a new centre for the village of Delvin, all areas that experienced huge emigration over the years. Deputies representing or with roots in rural areas will know the importance of that. It is bad to split the county and take 30% of the terrain of north Westmeath, which has only 6,000 voters. That will give an indication of how rural an area I was born into and which I am so privileged and honoured to represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>Oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the commission not consider taking a little part up at Clonee, a high-density area where 6,000 voters might mean only two or three streets, instead of affecting an entire third of a county? It baffles me that any fair-minded person aware of the geographical divide should fail to see that, if Meath needs to gain 6,000 voters, one can take some areas in Dublin that may not have increased in population rather than take one third of a county. Bad enough as that is, they have also split the parish of Castlepollard. At the next election I will not be able to vote for myself, while my brother, 400 metres up <Col N="651"/>the road, will fortunately still be able to vote for me. A divided community is regrettable.</P>
      <P>I would never have entered politics were it not for my belief in the power of the parish. This is exemplified by St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day in Croke Park and has informed my background in what one can do to assist one&rsquo;s constituents. When we are dead, it is not what one has done for counties 100 or 150 miles away from one&rsquo;s home that matters but what one has done for one&rsquo;s parish and community. I hope when that time comes for me, the local people will deem that I did my best and made a difference.</P>
      <P>That is the reason I am here today. I did not stand for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to make any material gain but because I saw part of my county, including the great town of Mullingar, not getting its fair share of investment. We did not get it because we had no representative in ministerial office. However, I thank colleagues from other counties for their efforts for the area, including the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, and Senator O&rsquo;Rourke.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>My party has been in Opposition in the past and I am aware of what we can do for the people of Westmeath when we are in Government.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the constituency boundary commission mean I have lost 24% of my first preference vote, or 1,907 votes. My colleague, Deputy Penrose, has lost 608 votes, Deputy Paul McGrath has lost 807 votes and Senator O&rsquo;Rourke has lost 104 votes. The odds seems to be stacked against me retaining my seat. There may be an uphill battle but I place the same confidence in the people at the next general election that I did on the last occasion. They responded magnificently and it is clear they made the correct decision given the investment that has <Col N="652"/>come to the county. Some of this may have been on the way but, as Napoleon once said, &ldquo;Do not give me good generals, give me lucky ones&rdquo;. I am the lucky Deputy for the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>

	<P>We should put Deputy Cassidy in a lucky bag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>If that luck is to continue, I am confident the people of the county will consider me for their first preference in the next election.</P>
      <P>I have some advice for colleagues on the other side of the House who are, like me, first-time Deputies. As an Oireachtas Member for 23 years, I confirm the most difficult time to get elected is the second time. Opposition Members may smile and feel confident they are on their way to re-election for a second time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>However, they should be wary of the underdog. I am not beaten yet and am fired up for the challenge. Anybody who hopes to take my seat will have much hard work to do between now and the next general election because I have worked hard for the last three years and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>

	<P>I would vote for Deputy Cassidy after hearing him speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill should have provided for two extra D&aacute;il seats. The commission could have recommended either a reduction of two seats to 164 or an increase of two to 168. It is a shame it did not choose the latter approach. The people of north Westmeath and Leitrim have much in common. Neither area has got its fair share of the spoils of the Celtic tiger. However, all the hard work has been put in place to ensure this situation will be rectified. We are all here to effect change and to do our best on behalf of the people with whom we were reared.</P>
      <P>Fairness must prevail. This is not the case in respect of north Westmeath and Leitrim where in the case of each, 30% of the electorate is being taken away from its natural terrain. However, there is no doubt the commission had a difficult job which it undertook according to what it considered the best interests of the electorate. I had the great honour of sitting beside Paudge Brennan and S&eacute;amus Mallon when I first entered <Col N="653"/>the Seanad in 1982. Paudge Brennan was always good for a one-liner and he once said, &ldquo;there is never the right time to do the right thing&rdquo;. The correct approach for the commission to take the next time it sits is to treat county boundaries as sacrosanct.</P>
      <P>If changes must be made, it is better they take place in the large cities, including Dublin, Cork and Galway. In these areas, a Deputy will secure 6,000 votes in an area of only half a mile. In rural north Westmeath, by contrast, the population of the village of Coole was shown to have declined by 1.6% in the last census. I have been honoured to represent the people of Castlepollard, Fore, Collinstown, Ballymanus, Delvin, Clonmellon and Riverdale in Raharney. This latter village has been split by the commission. It makes no sense to divide 300 people in a rural area so that 100 are assigned to a constituency in County Meath and 200 stay in Longford-Westmeath. It is a heartless act.</P>
      <P>I look forward to being returned as a Deputy for the people of the new constituency of Longford-Westmeath. People from Westmeath have always worked well with those of Longford. We form a natural terrain of co-operation and were part of the same area for the purpose of the former health board, for example. I will be honoured and privileged to continue to serve as a Member of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with the wishes of the electorate of Longford-Westmeath. I will conclude with the words of Abraham Lincoln: &ldquo;I do the very best I know how; the very best I can; and I mean to keep on doing it to the end.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>One wonders whether Abraham Lincoln was also a parish man. That last contribution lacked only a lorry decked out with flags and perhaps a chapel with a congregation emerging to hear the triumphalist speech. This will not cut ice with Members on this side of the House. However, I am pleased to hear Deputy Cassidy is opposed to this legislation or the elements of it which split county boundaries. I look forward to the Deputy joining the ranks of the Opposition when it counts most, in voting against this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the importance of the legislation governing our electoral process cannot be overstated. When such legislation is flawed, as this Bill clearly is, it must be opposed in the strongest possible manner. This is what Sinn F&eacute;in intends to do. The legislation governing the work of the constituency commission which drew up the recommendations being implemented in this Bill was itself flawed. This should be a matter of the deepest concern to all those committed to retaining the integrity of our electoral process.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, I put Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view regarding the constituency commission&rsquo;s recommendations on the record when I raised the matter on the Adjournment. At that time I urged the Minister to reject those recommendations and to introduce legislation to allow the formation of six-seat and seven-seat constituencies, after which <Col N="654"/>the constituency commission should be reconvened. The Minister has failed to do this.</P>
      <P>Sinn F&eacute;in made a submission to the constituency commission about constituencies for the election of Members to the D&aacute;il. Our submission was based not only on the need to consider boundaries in the context of the 2002 census results but, more importantly, in the context of what constitutes a just representative electoral system. Our concerns centre on the increase in the number of three-seat constituencies. We must consider why these seem to be the favoured option for dealing with population growth and change. Is it because three-seat constituencies have always entirely favoured larger parties such as Fianna F&aacute;il? Does this represent an attempt to protect the political interests of such parties?</P>
      <P>By once again increasing the number of three-seat constituencies, this legislation further dilutes the proportionality of our electoral system. This is not in the interest of diversity nor is it in the interest of the people. For the third consecutive commission, the number of five seat constituencies has been cut while the number of three seat constituencies steadily grows. I am concerned the existence of three seat constituencies in certain areas and five seat constituencies in others creates inequality between voters in different parts of the State. Nowhere is that more clearly demonstrated than in the city of Dublin. Almost all the constituencies north of the Liffey have three seats but there are a number of five seat constituencies on the other side of the river. Could it be that the Government does not trust the bulk of the working class people on the northern side of the Liffey to do the right thing at election time? Is it the case that the people from the more leafy lanes on the southern side are prepared to elect what I heard many Ministers describe as &ldquo;right thinking people&rdquo;? It is grossly unfair that is the case.</P>
      <P>The Government side referred to the independent nature of the commission. That is not good enough. The essential problem is the commission is constrained by legislation to have constituencies sized between three and five seats. Therein lies part of the problem. It is worth contrasting the seven and even nine seat constituencies, which were evident in this State when it was established in the early 1920s, with the mainly three or four seat constituencies in this so-called modern age. It is ironic that the founders of the State &mdash; of course, pre-Blueshirt time &mdash; had a greater awareness and social conscience by allowing proper representation and proportionality in this Parliament as opposed to what we have now and the current Government.</P>
      <P>Proportional representation with a single transferable vote using multi-seat constituencies was not designed with the intention of applying it to three seat constituencies. The number of Members returned per constituency is a crucial component of the Irish electoral system. The higher the number of Members returned per con<Col N="655"/>stituency, the greater the proportionality of that system. My party will bring forward amendments to section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 to allow for the formation of six and seven seat constituencies in that larger constituency size adds the quality of extra proportionality to the electoral system as a whole. If accepted, these amendments will restore the positive attributes of the proportional representation single transferable vote system in terms of local accountable representatives and voters being able to make inter and intra party choices.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the case alluded to by a number of speakers concerning County Leitrim. My party is opposed to the division of County Leitrim between the two proposed new constituencies of Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim which this Bill will implement. Section 6(2)(<i>c</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 states that &ldquo;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;. It is unfortunate that is being completely ignored in the case of Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Although there was an element of partisan electioneering in Deputy Cassidy&rsquo;s contribution, I accept the points he made about breaching county boundaries and about areas with large population densities which would be much more able to accommodate those changes. If Deputy Cassidy is to carry that conviction through to its logical conclusion, he should oppose this Bill because it does exactly the opposite.</P>
      <P>It has caused major concern and upset in County Leitrim. There is a genuine feeling that the splitting of the county will prevent the people of Leitrim from electing a person from that county to the D&aacute;il, perhaps for the foreseeable future. If the amendments I propose regarding the permitted size of a constituency were accepted, the constituency commission could be reconvened to consider the possibility of establishing a six seat constituency comprising the three counties of Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon and avoid the unacceptable division of County Leitrim between the two proposed new constituencies. This legislation further damages the integrity of our electoral system and will, no doubt, contribute to the growing levels of apathy among voters in particular and the public in general.</P>
      <P>The issue of registration was raised by the previous speaker. Rate collectors used to handle registration for the local authority. Since the abolition of rates in 1977 that whole project has been put on the backburner. It is completely haphazard at this stage. The rate collector still visits each locality, will call to a small number of houses and will take a sounding from those people on who has moved into the area, who has died, who is moving on and who should be on the register. It is generally conducted in a haphazard manner. There should be a significant registration drive to ensure all those entitled to vote are registered to do so, otherwise they simply will not count at election time. The next issue is how to manage it.</P><Col N="656"/>
      
      <P>The previous speaker alluded to the possibility of using An Post for that purpose. That is a wonderful idea but I am concerned that by the time of the next election, there will be no such thing as a postman or a postwoman given this Government&rsquo;s current policies. If there are a few An Post employees left in rural Ireland, they will have no idea who is resident in a house because they will leave post in the green box at the end of the lane or even the end of the townland. They will not have the intimate knowledge of the rural population members of An Post currently have. That is one important element of the work An Post could carry out. Ensuring a proper registration system is put in place would be an additional service for the people and the institutions of this State. It would also require a significant change in Government policy because the thrust to gear the postal service for privatisation will not assist that institution in terms of facilitating the registration drive.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have spoken against the breaching of county boundaries which I fully support. However, the number of seats per constituency is even more important. Three or four seat constituencies do not facilitate proportionality as envisaged under proportional representation single transferable vote system. If that core principle of our electoral system is to be re-established, we must revert to large constituency sizes &mdash; perhaps to seven or nine seat constituencies which were in place in the early days of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to speak on this Bill but I, like many others, have been badly affected by the change. Although I welcome two three seat constituencies in County Meath, I am disappointed some of the areas of north Meath, particularly my home area of Kells which I have served for almost 30 years as a county councillor, has been divided. It is unfair to the people of what is a quite rural area. My colleague and friend from County Louth sitting in the benches opposite, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd, would be familiar with much of that area which is close to Ardee and includes Drumconrath and part of the Slane area as far as Monknewtown, close to Drogheda. It is a very rural area whose inhabitants tried for years to get a real rural Deputy who could serve them. Eventually, in 1997 they got a Deputy who knew what rural life was all about and who had worked for the people of the area.</P>

	<P>Was that Deputy McEntee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>This was my electoral area of Kells which runs from the far side of Oldcastle, past Mountnugent and up to Kingscourt on one side and back up to Ardee on the other side. As a Deputy, I was assigned that part of the Slane area with which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd would be very familiar. These areas have little in common with Ashbourne, Ratoath, Dunboyne or Dunshaughlin <Col N="657"/>and it is unfortunate that the Kells area has been split up.</P>
      <P>I remember that when I was first elected to Meath County Council in 1974, part of the Kells area was included in the constituency of Cavan and helped to elect one great man, the famous T&aacute;naiste.</P>

	<P>I wanted the Deputy to have a good audience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1974, when I was elected to Meath County Council, part of the Kells area in north Meath was included in the constituency of Cavan. As I said, it helped to elect the great former T&aacute;naiste, John Wilson, who held several ministerial posts, including education, and whose nephew is a Member of the Upper House. The other part of the Kells area was included in the constituency of Monaghan, before Monaghan and Cavan were joined together to form a single five-seat constituency. This area of north Meath, which included part of Nobber and Drumcondra and extended to Carlanstown helped the present Ceann Comhairle to be elected in the constituency of Monaghan at that time.</P>
      <P>That area later reverted to the Meath constituency. One also had a situation whereby the Coole area of north Westmeath was included in the Meath constituency. It helped my great friend, colleague and councillor, Michael Lynch, with whom I served for 30 years, to be elected to this House a number of times. Finally, we reverted to our own five seat constituency from which I was honoured to be elected in 1997. Unfortunately, a change has come which will divide my area in two. Of the five Deputies elected in 2002, I am the only one who has been badly affected. However, although I have been, perhaps I am fortunate to be getting the area which will be lost by my great friend and colleague, Deputy Cassidy. The Coole district, including Castlepollard, Fore, Delvin, Collinstown, Clonmellon and part of Ratharney will be incorporated into the Meath West constituency.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Deputy Cassidy and sympathise with him for losing the Coole electoral area of County Westmeath. As we know, Deputy Cassidy has been a very hard-working Deputy for the people of the county and constituency of Westmeath. He was the first Deputy to be elected from north Westmeath since 1965. It is sad that having been finally elected in 2002, this change affecting him comes along. It is not easy and I wish him well. I know that because of the work he has done for the people of Westmeath and will <Col N="658"/>continue to do for the people of Longford-Westmeath, he will be successful in that new constituency. I hope I will be as successful with that part of County Westmeath which will come into the new Meath West constituency.</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, I thank the people of the old Meath constituency, particularly those from areas which I served for 30 years in the old Kells district such as Moynalty, Tierworker, Newcastle, Nobber, Drumconrath, Meathill, Ballinaclose, Kilmainhamwood and Kilbeg who have been very good to me. Those people have also been very good to me since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 1997. Other areas of the Navan district have also been affected. It is sad to lose these areas and the great people in the Slane area of east Meath who have been very good to me. I thank them for their support over the previous two general elections.</P>
      <P>I am badly affected by the changes brought about by the constituency boundary commission but Deputy Cassidy and Deputy Ellis, who has seen his county of Leitrim divided in two, are in a worse situation. I know that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has been affected by the changes. However, we must move on and there will be plenty of challenges in the new constituencies.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the constituency changes with which I was disappointed was that the members of the constituency boundary commission who made these decisions, honourable and highly thought of as they may be, unfortunately probably do not know the landscape of parts of these constituencies. There is a very small Gaeltacht area in Meath that consists of Baile Ghib and Rath Cairn. It is unfortunate that these two areas have been divided under the new constituency changes. Both areas are in the Kells electoral area but Baile Ghib is now assigned to the Meath East constituency while Rath Cairn will be assigned to the Meath West constituency. My colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has looked after Rath Cairn over recent years and that area will remain in our constituency for the moment.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed and saddened for the people of Baile Ghib because I represented that area for the last eight years and it was an area that needed considerable attention and help. Many measures are under way in Baile Ghib to promote the Irish language. I thank the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who has been very helpful to me in my efforts to help and promote the Irish language in the Baile Ghib area. It is sad that the people in Baile Ghib must now go into a new constituency and I hope that my colleagues, including Deputy Mary Wallace, will represent Baile Ghib and help its people because it is a growing area that needs assistance. I hope that Baile Ghib&rsquo;s representatives will continue to fight to see that it gets the same attention as other Gaeltacht areas.</P><Col N="659"/>
      
      <P>We may be disappointed and saddened by these constituency changes but we must move on. We must move into our new constituencies and help the people living in them. The situation could have been worse if the new M3 had divided our constituency. That would have finished me off for all time. Fortunately, the route that would have divided Kells from where I live was not chosen. That would have been a disaster.</P>
      <P>Meath is a changing constituency and county. The M3 will bring enormous benefits to the county. I hope construction of the road will receive permission to proceed because the unfortunate people who travel this route every day face long commutes to Dublin. I am familiar with this. My colleague, Deputy McEntee, spoke on the radio this morning while caught in traffic about how he had never realised how long the commute could be. When I first took my seat in the D&aacute;il in 1997, I could leave my house at 8.30 a.m. and arrive at Leinster House at 9.45 a.m. Now I must leave the house at 7.30 a.m. to arrive at Leinster House at 9.45 a.m. This is an example of the change that has taken place in Meath.</P>
      <P>The county now faces the major change brought about by its division into two constituencies. I thank the people I represented in the old Meath constituency who will move to the new Meath East constituency for their support. I hope I will be returned to this House in the new Meath West constituency in the next general election in 2007. While I am always ready to help the people in rural north Meath, I am also willing, should I be re-elected, to use my considerable experience to assist the people of the highly populated areas of Ashbourne or Dunboyne with their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies Cowley and Harkin for facilitating me. Many issues arise out of this Bill and I would like to address briefly the issues of the register of electors, voter turnout, polling days, electronic voting and the storage of electronic voting machines, the increase in the number of three-seat constituencies, the decrease in the number of five-seat constituencies and the diminution of proportionality that the recommendations of the constituency boundary commission will bring about.</P>
      <P>In my experience over recent years, the register of electors has not been compiled in the fashion that it was previously. A significant number of people are not on the register and many are on the register who have either died or changed address. Since the specific duty of revenue collectors has been changed, the formulation of the register has suffered. There needs to be a specifically designated officer, whether it is a revenue collector, new officer in a local authority or someone like a postperson, with responsibility for ensuring that the register of electors is up to date. Compiling the register is not an easy job, especially in built-up urban areas where people change address frequently, there is a high pro<Col N="660"/>portion of rented accommodation and house sales, and new housing estates and buildings are constructed. It is a job that needs a specifically designated officer to carry it out and he or she should be paid properly to ensure the job is done properly. Many national and local public representatives are concerned by the inaccuracies in the register.</P>
      <P>On the issue of polling day and voter turnout, we have all witnessed the decline in voter turnout in recent years, especially in European elections and referendums. The turnout recently has been considerably down on what it was a number of years ago. Part of the difficulty relates to students and employment. Everyone seems to be employed now, for example, husband and wife or both partners in a relationship, and it can be difficult to ensure that one votes on a working day. I strongly suggest that the change to Fridays has been unsuccessful, in particular for students. Serious consideration should be given to moving voting to Sundays, which would give everyone an opportunity. No one would have a reasonable excuse not to vote on a Sunday.</P>
      <P>I have said from day one that there is no necessity for electronic voting. Even the proper use of State money concerning this issue is a waste as electronic voting is not necessary for the working of the electoral, proportional representation and democratic systems. Good use could be made of this money in other areas, including our health, educational and other services. Electronic voting should be set aside. No undue difficulty exists with the current manual system. I strongly object to the information that has come into the public domain recently whereby electoral officials, returning officers or their relatives have contracts to store electronic voting machines that have never been used and will never be used. This is a serious situation that should not be allowed to continue. Where it has happened, the Department should raise it with the individuals concerned and stop it immediately. Serious questions would be asked if a Deputy or a close relation of a Member of the House were involved in activity of this nature. This situation does not help our democratic system or make for transparency or good governance.</P>
      <P>The Bill is fundamentally flawed due to the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference. My basic concern is the increase in the number of three-seat constituencies and the proposed division of County Leitrim between so-called &ldquo;Sligo-North Leitrim&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roscommon-South Leitrim&rdquo;. The recommendations in the Constituency Commission&rsquo;s report, which would be implemented were this Bill passed, take us further down the road of diluting proportionality in the electoral system. This is not in the interests of diversity, democracy or individual electors. What is obvious from the report is that, for the third consecutive commission, we have a situation wherein the number of five-seat constituencies has been cut and the number of three-seat constituencies sig<Col N="661"/>nificantly increased. This is not good for proportional representation.</P>
      <P>I will refer to and thank the &ldquo;Save Leitrim&rdquo; campaign for information on this subject, a subject that affected me in 1997. The campaign&rsquo;s information shows that, in general elections from 1987 on and taking the 1997 and 2002 elections as examples, a significant number of individuals, be they independents or from political parties, received in excess of 20% of the vote in three seat constituencies but were not elected. For instance, I got 21.6% of the vote in my constituency in 1997 but was not elected. Former Deputy, Mr. Paddy Harte, got 21.8% in Donegal North East. Deputy Martin Ferris in Kerry North got 20.4%. Former Deputy, Mr. Tom Berkery, got 21.6% in Tipperary North. In the 2002 election, Mr. Dessie Ellis in Dublin North West got 21.4% of the vote. Former Deputy, Mr. Dick Spring, got 23.9% in Kerry North. Former Deputy, Mr. Alan Dukes, got 23.9% in Kildare South. Senator Noel Coonan in Tipperary North got 23%.</P>
      <P>If we had been running in any contiguous constituency of more than three seats and received similar percentages, we would have been elected on the first count because we would have won more votes than the Deputies elected therein. In all these examples, a substantial section of the electorate could feel justifiably annoyed that their chosen candidates were not elected. Understanding how the system can be fair in such circumstances is difficult. The full benefits of the PR system are not being spread fairly throughout the electorate. The situation of candidates not being elected on more than 20% of the overall vote whereas they would have been elected on the first count in four or five seat constituencies does not add up and is unfair.</P>
      <P>The commission&rsquo;s terms of reference must be significantly changed. The reduction in the number of five-seat constituencies dilutes the proportionality our system has always had. The increase in the number of three-seat constituencies does not help democracy or the PR system. Six-seat constituencies should be included in the terms of reference. That they exclude anything other than three to five-seat constituencies dilutes the proportionality of our system. The number of five and six-seat constituencies should be increased to ensure proportionality and fairness are facts rather than fictions.</P>
      <P>The breaching of county boundaries must be avoided at all costs. That a county such as Leitrim will almost certainly no longer be in a position to elect a county man or woman to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is not good for democracy, Leitrim or this House. The terms of reference of the commission must be strengthened to ensure county boundaries are not be breached in this way. In my constituency the county boundary is breached but at least the other term of reference of the commission, the natural boundary, is adhered to. On the southern side of my constituency, the strip of Waterford that is in Tipperary South is contiguous to the <Col N="662"/>town of Clonmel and that town is the nearest centre for shopping and work. At least in that instance the commission&rsquo;s approach is understandable. Splitting a county, particularly a county such as Leitrim, in two should not be accepted. I would like substantive amendments to be made to this Bill before it is passed, particularly in regard to county boundaries, the terms of reference of a future commission, electronic voting, the day of voting and the preparation of the register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to speak on this Bill. Its provisions reflect a shift of population from rural to urban areas as a result of the new commuter culture, principally in the counties around Dublin. It is obvious any further change in the future will reflect more an urban than a rural population. That is regrettable. Successive speakers have talked about the need to retain county boundaries. The Bill proposes changes in 23 constituencies, leaves 15 unchanged and creates five new ones but replaces four existing ones.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to remarks made by speakers of political parties, Deputies Ring and Durkan. Deputy Durkan did not accept the contention that Independents were good for the nation. I strongly disagree with that view. We address the issues that the political parties do not address. We would not be here were it not for the fact that the political parties have ignored the real issues of concern to people, particularly those in the west and north west who have suffered in this regard.</P>
      <P>Changes are occurring. My fear is that we are moving from rural to urban representation, of which we already have enough.</P>
      <P>There is great disillusionment with the political parties and I do not know if the proposed changes will help in any way to dispel that. It will be more difficult for Independents and candidates of small parties to get elected. People have voted with their feet to more than double the number of Independents elected to this D&aacute;il. That did not happen by chance but because people realised that representation by Independents was the way forward. Independents are an advocate for the people. They can best represent the issues of concern in a constituency by cutting out the middle man, as it were, and the political party agenda. It is obvious that a group of Independents on a shared policy platform can go forward in a positive way. Although Independents can still continue to pursue individual constituency issues, the public would have an organised group for whom to vote at the next general election.</P>
      <P>There is a move towards an Independent alliance, which could well hold the balance of power in the next general election and be in a position to participate in Government on the basis of agreed policies. Nobody can doubt that Independents are here to stay. Not only that, but they will be a major force to be reckoned with in future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and, unfortunately, they saw the train coming down the track. It is obvious that people recognise that Independent Members have the capacity, which they have utilised in the past, to exert an effect on Government above and beyond their numbers. One need only recall how Deputy Gregory made a multimillion pound deal with the then Government and the influence exerted by Deputy Healy-Rae to recognise the balance of power effect of a small number of Independents. It is amazing what can be done in such circumstances. If people do not believe that, they need only look to the PDs and note their small number of members yet the effect they have above and beyond their numbers because they have incorporated their policies into the programme for Government. There is no reason Independents could not do that and they will do that. These are the issues that matter to the people. If there are Members representing the issues that matter to the people in such numbers and the electorate has that power to return sufficient Deputies to make a difference, they will make a difference.</P>
      <P>People view Independent Deputies as very much a credible alternative who would put forward policies on issues on a common platform which they would put before the people in a general election campaign, and the people would then be in a position to return many more Independents. The numbers of Independents doubled in this D&aacute;il and in the next D&aacute;il, at the very least, 21 plus Independents might be elected. I do not believe Independents would be so arrogant as to state in advance they would not speak to any group who would be capable of forming a Government. That is my opinion. The name of the game is to implement the people&rsquo;s policies, not to advance the party agenda. It is the latter that has got in the way of solving the issues facing the people of the west, north west and so on.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that many members of political parties are genuine but the political party agenda and the centralising policy of the parties, get in the way. That has been the case since the forma<Col N="664"/>tion of the State, and party agenda is more of the same.</P>
      <P>That issue is the difference between the Independent alliance or any proposed Independent alliance and the political parties. The political parties are not people-centred or issues-centred. The Independent alliance is organised on the basis of policies. The alliance is about people, not power, and that is the difference.</P>
      <P>One need only reflect on what happened in this D&aacute;il and what may happen in the next D&aacute;il. Independent Deputies represent a highly credible percentage of the total Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. It is obvious that members of the electorate have great potential in this regard and the power is in their hands. That should never be forgotten by the political parties and their hangers-on who work out the permutations and combinations and have it all solved. The people have the power are prepared to use it and I am convinced they will use it.</P>
      <P>There are crucial issues that unite Independents and drive them to seek election to the D&aacute;il in the first instance. In addressing those common issues, which are very clear, Independents can go forward on a common platform.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to protect the rural population. Remote areas, in particular, and gutted inner city areas are opposite ends of the spectrum but they are equally depopulated and neglected. All those areas deserve to have proper representation from their Deputies and not lose such representation as is currently happening.</P>
      <P>The more representation an area has, the greater chance it has of having access to better services. I have often spoken about the vicious circle, which I have observed, of services being lost in rural areas with the continuing trend of depopulation. If one can break the vicious circle by providing the necessary services, one can make a difference. That is what Deputy Gregory did with his multimillion pound deal for Dublin inner city. He made a difference by securing the resources to put in place the necessary services to retain the population and give new life to an area. Independents have the know-how to do that, to represent people&rsquo;s real needs and to do something about meeting them. They can feel the pain of the people&rsquo;s neglect and can cry from the heart for equality and justice to halt the decline, whether it is happening in an inner city or a rural area. The only way to break the vicious circle of continuing depopulation is by the provision of adequate infrastructure. The lack of such provision has been the difficulty.</P>
      <P>Currently we are awaiting an announcement regarding the western rail corridor, in respect of which provision is extremely important. From a value for money perspective, it makes great sense to support the west by supporting the western rail corridor, which is the largest and most important piece of infrastructure in the west. This important infrastructure is lying fallow, which needs to change. The big fear everyone has, and it is a real <Col N="665"/>fear, is that the political parties will repeat the same old story. It is expected that the political parties will just throw money at the most populated part of the region and forget about the remainder of it until the year dot. That would be par for the course for the political parties but I hope I am wrong. I hope the Minister will announce funding which is front-loaded for the development of the entire western rail corridor. The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s, idea of a CL&Aacute;R area, which is based on the greatest areas of depopulation and deprivation, should be applied to the western rail corridor and the money invested in Mayo and Sligo. These are the areas that need to have the funding front-loaded to ensure that balanced regional development will occur.</P>
      <P>The cost of the Luas and other developments in Dublin is significant. There is currently mention of a third terminal for Dublin Airport. When I spoke about a second terminal at Knock Airport there was a right hullabaloo about it. Why does it make sense to have 17 million people travelling to the east of the country, when less than half a million people are travelling to the west to an international airport which is a wonderful facility. It would make much more sense for people to use that airport rather than trying to pile more people into the congested Dublin area where traffic is reduced to ass and cart pace. People cannot get in or out of the city, yet there is talk of a third terminal while a second terminal at Knock will not be considered.</P>
      <P>When I talk about a second terminal at Knock, I am referring to a proper apron where there is a rapid turnaround time to allow a number of jet aircraft to arrive on schedule at the airport. The Government has not invested money in Knock Airport. It has treated it just like another local airport and not a wonderful catalyst for the whole west and north west area. It never recognised it as the wonderful international airport which it is. Because all the funding has been invested in Cork and Dublin airports, it means that Knock Airport will not realise its full potential. If people are talking in mad terms about putting second and third terminals into Dublin, why not put that development into Knock, including the roads leading in and out of Mayo and so on? Why not put that money into the western rail corridor, which would make much more sense than further depopulating the area?</P>
      <P>The vicious circle continues with loss of services. It can only be broken by adequate infrastructure. Whether one lives in Ballycroy, County Mayo, or Tallaght, County Dublin, the need for adequate resources and supporting services is the same. Whether one lives in Kildare or wherever, there needs to be the infrastructure to support houses. There needs to be playgrounds and adequate resources for people to live in an area.</P>
      <P>The creation of three-seat constituencies in rural areas damages the equality of representation. This Bill will see the new configuration of <Col N="666"/>constituencies in North Connaught-North Leinster area with three-seaters named Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim as well as a four-seater in Longford-Westmeath. The division of County Leitrim into two constituencies, Sligo-North Leitrim and Roscommon-South Leitrim, will make it next to impossible for Ireland&rsquo;s least populated county to return a Deputy and will mean that Leitrim will not have any quality representation in the D&aacute;il. It would be a shame if there was not representation in the D&aacute;il of the calibre of Deputy Harkin, who did wonderful work before she was elected to the House for the development of the west, and continues to do so both at D&aacute;il and EU level. Were it not an independent commission, people might cynically say that there is something afoot here. I was interested that Fianna F&aacute;il members were not included in the list Deputy Healy read.</P>
      <P>The Government should re-examine the legislation that requires each constituency to have at least three and no more than five D&aacute;il seats. Six seats should be allowed in a constituency where county boundaries determine a natural constituency. This would give greater freedom of choice and representation in counties Tipperary, Kerry, Cork, Meath, Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for two fewer five-seat constituencies than exist currently and favours establishment parties, thus preventing new voices from entering the D&aacute;il. My colleague, Deputy McGrath, has called the loss of one of the five seats in his Dublin North Central constituency an attack on democracy, with which I agree. It would be a tragedy if the cold undemocratic hand of so-called electoral reform was to extinguish one of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s brightest stars. Electoral reform is a misnomer. Electoral gerrymandering would be a more correct description of what is going on here. I wish Deputy McGrath every good luck. I hope he will be returned to the D&aacute;il because it would be tragic if he was not.</P>
      <P>Any loss of representation in the D&aacute;il runs counter to democracy. The Bill provides for 18 three-seat constituencies and 12 five-seat constituencies. The move away from five-seat constituencies is regrettable and damaging because it makes it more difficult for small parties and independents to grow and gain seats.</P>
      <P>I do not believe electronic voting should be used in the future. Many people here said they were against electronic voting from the beginning. There is a saying, &ldquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rdquo;. Why should we do away with something the people enjoy? We have already lost more than &euro;52 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money on this fiasco called electronic voting, and we will lose more. All these machines are still stored away. It would be better to cut our losses and retain the system we currently have, which serves us well and fits in ideally with the blood sport which is politics in Ireland. People are trying to do away with hare coursing, with which I agree. However, I would <Col N="667"/>like to see one blood sport retained, that is, the current system of voting. It is a good system which people enjoy and it should be retained.</P>
      <P>The former Deputy, Paddy Harte, said that the Constitution states that each constituency shall have not less than three members, and the 1997 Electoral Act says not more than five members. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has the power to alter that law, and rightly so. Mr. Harte said it is time to re-examine the Act and consider amending the law to allow six seats in a constituency where the county boundaries determine the natural constituency, with which I agree. A new six-seat constituency law would give greater freedom of choice and be more democratic in Tipperary, Kerry, Cork South and East, Meath, Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I agree that people come into the D&aacute;il to do their best but the political party agenda is getting in the way of what people wish to do. There is another way. When there are permutations and combinations by the political parties and their friends in the media and elsewhere, they should remember there is another alternative which the people recognise, namely, the independent alternative, which is a credible one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill. I give my full support to Deputy Cowley who spoke so eloquently of the need for balanced regional development, including further development at Knock Airport, front-loading funding to the western rail corridor and giving a fair share of funds to the regions. The current spending imbalance under the national development plan is a disgrace and Governments should hang their heads in shame. Balanced regional development is supposed to be a key objective of the national development plan, yet the Government has turned its back on the concept of balanced regional development simply by not giving equal expenditure to the regions.</P>
      <P>I will deal now with the Bill. The Bill is first and foremost about democracy and ensuring that the wishes of the electorate are fairly reflected in the results of any election. We have an independent commission that must operate within its terms of reference. One of the problems here is its terms of reference. One of the stipulations is that the number of members in a constituency must be restricted to between three and five. I will return to the issue later. It certainly restricts the manoeuvring of the commission.</P>
      <P>All politics is local and therefore the first issue on which I want to comment is the proposal by the electoral commission to split County Leitrim in two for electoral purposes. The recommendations in this regard will have very serious consequences for the county. There is considerable anger in the county at this prospect.</P>
      <P>People in County Leitrim ask quite rightly why their county has been chosen. Is it because it is the smallest county or because its population <Col N="668"/>dropped from 155,000 &mdash; this was the population some 150 years ago &mdash; to 25,000 by the time of the last census? Is it because it is believed that the people of the county do not matter? Is it believed that they do not have sufficient political clout? Is it because the county was split before? County Leitrim found itself as the only county without a Deputy resident in the county.</P>
      <P>County Leitrim was once carved up between three constituencies for the general elections between 1969 and 1973. When it happened that there was no Deputy resident in the county, the backlash was such that action was taken to try to address the problem so it would never arise again. It was decided that the only possible solution was to protect the county boundary as an integral electoral unit. This was to ensure that every county, not just County Leitrim, would have a fair chance of electoral representation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>Since the first independent commission was established in 1980, County Leitrim was reunited as an electoral unit. To protect the county from being carved up in the future, it was agreed that a statutory protection be imposed on it requiring that county boundaries be protected where practicable. There is no doubt but that this protection was put in place to ensure that smaller counties, particularly County Leitrim, would never be without a resident Deputy. Nevertheless, County Leitrim finds itself in this position 25 years later.</P>
      <P>One might well ask how this could happen. One reason is that both major political parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, made submissions to the electoral commission stating the county should be split in two. Regardless of what members of these parties are now saying, their parties&rsquo; recommendation was that north Leitrim should become part of a constituency with Sligo and that south Leitrim should become part of a constituency with Roscommon. I have no doubt these submissions influenced the commission, otherwise it would not have accepted them. While the commission is independent, it does take the advice of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael. The advice was that the county should be split, carved up and divided. One cannot have it both ways. Those who vote for this Bill are saying to the people of County Leitrim, north and south, that they want the county to be carved up. Ultimately, the county will have to bear the consequences of our actions.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Cassidy speaking about County Westmeath and the problems faced by the people in Coole. I sympathise with them but their problem is not in the same league as that faced by the people of County Leitrim. Imagine if County Westmeath did not have a Deputy. Would it put up with it? Would counties Roscommon or Sligo put up with it? They would not, and rightly so. Neither should County Leitrim put up with it. The splitting of the county is unfair and undemocratic. It is a body blow to all those who have worked tirelessly for many <Col N="669"/>years for the regeneration of the county. It is a body blow to the pride of the county. County colours, the county jersey and county loyalty mean so much to so many people. My mother, who will not thank me for saying this, was born in County Leitrim and lived in County Sligo for the past 50 years. Whenever Leitrim is playing Gaelic football, regardless of whether it is playing against Sligo, she still supports the county in which she was born. She takes pride in the gold and green of County Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were lucky enough to live in County Leitrim when its team reached the All-Ireland semi-final against Dublin noted the great sense of pride in the county. In population terms, it was a case of the smallest county in Ireland playing the largest. It was great to be living in the county during those summer days. While I admit that the same enthusiasm might not be generated over politics, I realise that each county wants one of its own in the D&aacute;il. This Bill makes it likely, perhaps even very likely, that County Leitrim will find itself with no public representative in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>
      <P>There are those who might say the population of County Leitrim is just not large enough and that the major increase in population is in the east of the country. The latter is true and the increase is mainly driven by the fact that we do not have the balanced regional development of which I spoke. However, this is an argument for another day. The population shift is such that we must consider constituency boundaries and make changes. However, counties should not be made to suffer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Johnny Brady spoke about Members having difficulty holding their seats. I understand and sympathise with this view. What is really important is that voters and counties such as County Leitrim do not suffer. There are solutions to this problem, which solutions will ensure that County Leitrim and other such counties are not split in two for electoral purposes.</P>
      <P>In 1923 there were seven seats in the constituency containing County Leitrim. This continued until 1933. The county belonged to a constituency with five seats between 1948 and 1961. Therefore, there are solutions. The soft option, the easy option, is to split the county. I call on the Government to refer the proposal back to the electoral commission so it can allow for six-seat constituencies, thereby avoiding the totally unnecessary and absolutely discriminatory splitting of County Leitrim.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Another issue of crucial importance to everybody is that of fair and proportional representation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for each citizen in each constituency. Our electoral system is based on PR. It is designed to give the most accurate representation of the wishes of the electorate, such that not only can a voter express her prefer<Col N="670"/>ence for one candidate but she can also vote for a number of candidates in her order of preference. The system allows a voter to vote against a candidate and offers him or her a real choice.</P>
      <P>However, this is only half of the equation. The other half concerns the number of seats in a constituency. When the constituencies were being drawn up in Northern Ireland for the Assembly elections, they were all assigned six seats. This is because a six-seat constituency, using the PR system, results in the most accurate and proportional representation. It produces the fairest result, the result that best reflects the wishes of the people. If we as politicians and democrats are really serious about the wishes of the people and if we respect them, we should try to ensure that our electoral system truly reflects their wishes.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>If a six-seat constituency in a PR system is best in Northern Ireland, why is it not best for those of us who live south of the Border? Are we not as deserving of the very best representation? Why are we moving in the opposite direction by increasing the number of three-seat constituencies and decreasing the number of five-seat constituencies? Why do we have no six-seat constituencies, given that the Irish Government had a major influence in ensuring the formation of six-seat constituencies in Northern Ireland?</P>
      <P>Deputy Finian McGrath described this Bill as flawed and undemocratic and said it showed a lack of respect for citizens. I fully agree with him. Deputy Haughey criticised Deputy Finian McGrath and said we must ensure there is no imbalance in the degree of voter influence. That is right but there should be no imbalance in the degree of influence held by the large parties. The system we operate guarantees that imbalance. The increase in the number of three-seat constituencies will ensure an even greater imbalance which will favour the large parties. That is why I agree with Deputy Finian McGrath that the Bill does not respect the wishes of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarianHarkinIND"><NameTxt>Ms Harkin</NameTxt>
	<P>Furthermore, this Bill favours the large parties. How can we say this system is more democratic and equitable than the previous one? How can we expect voters to respect us as politicians when our system disproportionately favours the large parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael? Despite all their fine words on this Bill and the concerns of some about the splitting of the Leitrim constituency, many Deputies will vote for this Bill. In doing so they will ensure that the large parties gain and increase their number of seats relative to their percentage of the vote.</P>
      <P>This Bill creates a win-win situation for the large parties but for the electorate, the small parties, and Independent candidates, it is a lose-lose situation. One Government Deputy after another has told us the constituency boundary commission is independent and the Bill is the fairest possible outcome, while they know that is not the <Col N="671"/>case. They can smile in the knowledge that if this Bill is passed, the large parties will gain.</P>
      <P>The facts and figures speak for themselves. In all general elections between 1987 and 2002, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, the two largest parties with 74% of the vote, won 81% of the seats in three-seat constituencies. Small parties and Independent candidates with almost 34% of the vote gained 25% of the seats in three-seat constituencies. In other words, the two largest parties got 7% more seats than votes in three-seat constituencies and Independent candidates and small parties got 9% fewer seats than votes. Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael hold 81% of the seats in three-seat constituencies while in five-seat constituencies they hold 73% of the seats. Small parties and Independent candidates hold 19% of seats in three-seat constituencies while in five-seat constituencies they hold 27% of the seats. These figures reflect the results of all general elections since 1987 and show without any doubt that three-seat constituencies favour the large parties and discriminate against small parties and Independent candidates.</P>
      <P>Since 1980 the recommendations from the constituency commission have increased the number of three-seat constituencies by five and decreased the number of five-seat constituencies by three. Since 1980 the number of three-seat constituencies has increased by almost 40% and the number of five-seat constituencies has decreased by 20%. That is a substantial shift which has happened almost by stealth, yet it profoundly affects the outcome of elections. It distorts the system so that members of the large parties gain every time a new three-seat constituency is created, and every time a five-seat constituency is changed to either a three or a four-seat constituency.</P>
      <P>The voters in those constituencies do not have the same choice or proportionality as voters in five-seat constituencies. It is all very well for Deputies to say this Bill reflects the changing demographics of our society. It does, but the Bill must also ensure that our system is fair and that each voter has an equal opportunity to elect the candidates of his or her choice. That is not the case. This disenfranchises certain voters. The icing on the cake for the large parties is that it favours their candidates. Why should they complain?</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the constituency boundary commission should be changed for two reasons: to ensure the fairness and proportionality of this system and to maintain the integrity of county boundaries to ensure that counties such as Leitrim have a representative in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions to this debate. They have raised many issues across the political horizon but, as my time is limited, I will focus on some points <Col N="672"/>arising from the Bill. Other matters can be discussed in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies suggested alternatives to the schemes of constituencies proposed by the commission and set out in the Bill. I cannot foresee circumstances in which we will accept amendments that will alter the scheme of constituencies recommended by the commission. I accept that the proposals made, particularly by the latter speakers, were intended to serve the general interest rather than self-interest. It is important that we maintain the tradition of implementing the recommendations of the constituency boundary commission in full. We cannot adopt an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> attitude to an independent commission as the last two speakers have suggested and reject the commission&rsquo;s work because we do not like what it says.</P>
      <P>Since the report of the first commission in 1977 the Oireachtas has never changed the commission&rsquo;s recommendations presented in the form of a Bill. To reject some of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations now would be to revert to the partisan position of the past when constituency revisions were perceived as being framed to secure political advantage for the Government of the day. Even minor changes to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations would represent the first step back to the unsatisfactory situation which applied in the past. I cannot accept the special pleading of several speakers, including the last two. The Government will not tear up the commission&rsquo;s work simply because it does not suit.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a scheme of constituencies which is the product of an agreed process, operated in accordance with the specific rules set by distinguished personnel whose integrity and independence are beyond question. Deputy Cowley directly questioned the integrity of the commission. He should perhaps take some time to examine the record of the House and review his quite disgraceful proposition that the commission has operated in a politically partisan way. Unfortunately, Deputy Harkin took up Deputy Cowley&rsquo;s rant. It is outrageous that two speakers in this House should traduce in that way an independent commission made up of recognised individuals who have served this House and the State well. It is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>Having said all that, I do not see that it is our role, on this side of the House, to defend the recommendations of the commission without equivocation. Naturally, Deputies will have feelings about different constituencies and that is to be accepted. Almost every Deputy that contributed to the debate mentioned the situation in County Leitrim.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I can see that the commission had no option but to recommend some changes in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency, as the -11.01% variance below the national average representation of its 2002 population to seats ratio is more than 3% greater than the largest variance recommended by the commission in the history of the State. In other words, this is because of the political and demographic realities to which Deputy Harkin referred. It was suggested that a solution to the problem there might be to increase the total number of seats to 168. This would have reduced the constituency&rsquo;s variance from its four seats to -9.94%, so that it would still have been necessary for the Commission to operate as it did. Such a measure would also have changed the variance for the other 41 existing constituencies, resulting in quite unacceptable variances across some constituencies. We have to look at the impact of that reality.</P>
      <P>The commission brought forward its proposed solution for reasons already given. It is not proposed to depart from the package of recommendations that emerged from its deliberations. It would be wrong for us to revert to the situation where if we do not like what the commission has recommended, we do not accept it. We cannot adopt an <i>&agrave; la carte</i> approach and have any hope that people will take us seriously as politicians. We set up an independent commission and we gave it a task. Since it was established, the commission served us well and its reports have always been accepted by Members on all sides of the House, whether or not they were palatable. The commission has brought forward a solution and its recommendations on Leitrim are in line with constitutional requirements, particularly those relating to equality of representation. We have had constitutional cases on this issue. These cases make it very clear that there is an overriding responsibility to look at the equality of voters in Dublin, Leitrim, Donegal or wherever.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11-?>
      <P>Deputy Harkin made much of the statistical attractiveness of six seaters. The best way of getting absolute representation would be to get a single constituency for the entire country. That was tried elsewhere and it had nothing to recommend it. Deputy Gilmore claimed that Dublin county boundaries do not have the same status as other county boundaries in the commission&rsquo;s statutory terms of reference. He is correct, as the new constituency boundaries are not dealt with in the same way as the traditional county boundaries. The Deputy wants the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference to require it to avoid breaching Dublin <Col N="675"/>county boundaries in formulating D&aacute;il constituencies. The boundaries of the 32 counties of Ireland have been a historic reality since 1604, when the last county boundary was formed. In the past 200 years, the counties have been a well established focus for community activity and I accept the point that was made about local loyalties. On the other hand, the administrative counties of Fingal, South Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire have been in existence for just ten years. While they are forging ahead in serving their communities, they do not yet have the distinct identity of the longer established counties. As the individual identities of these new counties develop over time, we could possibly revisit the issue but we cannot adjust the commission&rsquo;s terms of reference for the moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finian McGrath referred to the constituency of Dublin North. Of the 42 existing constituencies, only three lost population between 1996 and 2002. These were Dublin North-East, Dublin North-West and the Deputy&rsquo;s constituency of Dublin North-Central. Taking these three adjoining constituencies together, the variance from the national average representation of their ten seats is equal to -9.41%. This requires significant changes to be made in existing constituency formation. Removing a seat from the area would have given an acceptable variation of 0.65% of the remaining nine seats. As Dublin North-East and Dublin-North West are already three seaters, neither could shed a seat, so any reduction had to come from the four seat constituency in Dublin North-Central. That does not suit some people, but that is the reality.</P>

Action had to be taken and that is what the commission recommended.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies mentioned the increase in the number of three-seaters. It has been argued that the creation of two additional three-seaters runs counter to the principle of proportional representation. I do not accept that. Three-seaters have been around for a long time.</P>

Subsection 5 of Article 16.2 provides that members shall be elected in the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. This is followed by the provision that no law shall be enacted whereby the members to be returned in a constituency shall be less than three. Therefore, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann clearly envisages three-seat constituencies. While I accept that proportionality of proportional representation-single transferable vote in individual constituencies falls as the number of seats is reduced, it should be borne in mind that the number of three-seats proposed in the report, 18, has been exceeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The PR-STV system has never claimed to achieve perfectly proportional results. Several proportional representation systems are more proportional, others much less so. For PR-STV to be perfectly proportional, the State would need to form a single constituency. Everybody recognises that this is not a practical suggestion. Constituency size in Ireland has been restricted to three, four and five seats since 1947. It would be too rigid to restrict the commission to one or two constituency sizes. We need some choice of constituency sizes to produce electoral areas that make sense to the people, such as, for example, enclosing entire communities or adhering to previous physical features. It is better to leave it to the commission to decide on the numbers of the different seat constituencies and where they should be located.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not find words to describe the way I felt on the last occasion I spoke. I hope the intervening period has given me sufficient inspiration to come up with the right words to describe this Bill. Here we have a monument to the Government&rsquo;s incompetence and ineptitude. The numbers on the waiting lists for driving tests <Col N="680"/>in recent years have shown that not only has the Government been oblivious to what was happening but also in this legislation it is incapable of prescribing some means of resolving the problem. We are approaching a general election, and how quickly this will occur only those on the other side of the House can tell us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Like most of its proposals, the Government will not divulge the secret until the last minute. We have large numbers of people waiting for driving tests, some of them up to 14 and 15 months. This is not a new phenomenon. It <Col N="681"/>has happened before on several occasions and a sticking plaster or fire brigade action has taken place on every occasion. On one occasion we had a write-off of all tests and everybody got a licence regardless of whether they could drive. We now have a temporary measure to introduce emergency powers, as it were, and semi-privatisation with bonuses to encourage driver testers. While I do not know how the bonus system will work, I presume it will encourage the testers to test more quickly or to test more people. However, it is proposed to reduce the number of people on the waiting list for the foreseeable future, in other words, the next two years. I presume it will ultimately achieve what was intended in the first place, which is to clear the backlog before the general election.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see everything that is being done at present is to clear the decks for the next general election and much clearing remains to be done. To address the issue of driver testing we have the same Government that produced the Red Cow roundabout, the tunnel that only takes small trucks and the electronic voting machines that will not work and cost a fortune to be stored. These are indicators of what has happened in the past. I do not see how this proposal will resolve the problems we are faced with.</P>
      <P>Given the numbers of people seeking driving tests at present, it was not today or yesterday it became obvious that we needed to address this area. It has been obvious for some years. It would have been simple to introduce additional testers at the time. As it happens, the number of additional testers will not make a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth of difference in terms of significantly increasing output. The economy depends on the ability of people to get to work. Looking at the traffic jams on the roads I wonder how the unfortunate commuters restrain themselves and do not take the law into their own hands, although I do not suggest they should do so. In a growing economy like ours, one would have expected it would have been possible to apply for a driving test and be called within a few weeks. This can be done in most other countries and I do not know why we are so special here that we cannot do so. Many of the problems stem from the practices that have become established over the years. For instance the number of tests carried out per day could be increased. I do not see why people should have to stop testing at 3 o&rsquo;clock or 4 o&rsquo;clock, when there is still a fair part of the day left. Even if it means introducing shifts of testers, that should be possible. There is nothing extraordinary about it, and one need not be a rocket scientist. I cannot see why testers should not operate at night. After all, a fair proportion of driving takes place then. There are serious doubts regarding whether, in some circumstances, people who have been tested and passed have enough experience of road use. What experience have those who were passed arbitrarily, with no test, because of a past back<Col N="682"/>log? Since a great many accidents occur at night, it should be possible to devise a system whereby a certain proportion of driving tests could take place then. After all, 50% of people do a certain amount of driving takes at night. Those of us who work in this House probably find that we drive more at night than during the day.</P>
      <P>What bugs me most is that this has arisen three or four times in the last ten years. There are long lists of people waiting for driving tests, and I cannot understand why no one has learned from that and decided that it might not be such a bad idea to increase the number of testers in line with the need that presents itself. The population is rising, and demographic trends should have been sufficient to establish the need for extra testers so things could progress in a normal way.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned at the bonus system. If the criterion is set in relation to how a driver is tested, it should not require a bonus to encourage anyone to carry out the test. I wonder about the semi-privatisation and why, at the end of the removal of the backlog, we are to revert to the old system. Does that mean that in two or three years there will be another backlog and a requirement to introduce a similar Bill?</P>
      <P>Let us return to an issue about which we should be concerned. We have a high rate of traffic accidents, and I fully understand that it is impossible to eliminate them all. Accidents will happen, and we should try to eliminate the circumstances in which they take place as much as possible. In many situations, they are a result of bad driving, inexperience, an inability to judge the road conditions and relate that to speed and so on. The list goes on, and for some unknown reason, between midnight and 6 a.m. we experience a high number of tragic accidents, many of them fatal. Research must be conducted to identify the causes, which clearly include bad driving and bad and unsafe roads.</P>
      <P>How many times have we had the experience that one comes to a bend or curve in the road and finds, as one tries to navigate it, that the road surface is rough or that one has to move from one side to the other to avoid potholes? Perhaps one sees a sign stating that one is at an accident blackspot. As I have said before on similar matters, that means nothing more than that several accidents have taken place, many of them fatal. In such circumstances, one hardly needs to be a rocket scientist to work out that one can do two things. One can identify whether in every case the fault was that of the driver. I am not so sure that, if one has 20 or 30 accidents in one location, driver error is always to blame. There are other factors to examine and eliminate as far as possible. We must examine driver qualifications, and ultimately also those of the testers, and the extent to which the road or road surface contributes to accidents, given the need to reduce road traffic accidents and especially fatalities as much as possible.</P><Col N="683"/>
      
      <P>I wonder whether, under this proposed system and regarding the need to encourage increased output, the test will not be as rigorous as previously. Will it be universally applicable, with the same standards and requirements applying across the country? If there are 1,000 people on one waiting list and 500 on another, will that automatically mean that, given the Bill&rsquo;s thrust, where the longer waiting list presents itself, the testers will be less rigorous? I would like that answered by the Minister. I have a funny feeling that tendency will be there, given the pressure to reduce the waiting list. People must be getting very accustomed to waiting. We now have waiting lists to enter schools, for housing, as my colleague will readily verify, for hospital treatment and for driver testing. We have virtually become the home of such lists, a rather undesirable accolade. There are waiting lists everywhere. We will have waiting lists to enter a tunnel that cannot accommodate its intended traffic, and on the M50, for the traffic that cannot get up or down it on a Friday afternoon or any other day. Deputies should see it for themselves. We are in the era of waiting.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister might clarify in his reply whether there will be universal application of the standard required of a driver. Will each area get the same treatment, or will there be attempts to speed matters up in certain areas to achieve the target before the next general election, an important date? My colleague, Deputy Carey, like everyone else in the Houses is very concerned about what might happen between now and the next general election.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in the board of the authority. We live in the age of such authorities, which are not accountable to this House and for which Ministers will not be accountable to it. Every day that passes I receive replies stating that the Minister has no responsibility to the House on various issues. I have no doubt that we will be hearing that in future. I do not accept that general rule, about which I have always protested. The Minister should be answerable to the House for every issue which arises under his or her Department and which is paid for under the Department&rsquo;s Vote. There is no other arena in which he might be made responsible or the public might get answers to questions. There is nowhere else for members of the Opposition to go to get an answer to a simple question other than tabling a question to the relevant Minister. Unfortunately, recently we have moved ever further from that. The theory is that it is good for government, but it is bad for it. It allows a siege mentality to develop that prevents the Government from asking itself questions, something that it should do. Regardless of which parties are in power, it is never in the interests of a Government to be economical with the degree to which a Minister is responsible to the House in respect of any or <Col N="684"/>all of the legislation he or she has passed, even where such legislation provides for the devolution of powers to an external authority or body, which has increasingly been the practice in recent years.</P>
      <P>We should all do what we can to improve the standard of driving on our roads. I welcome the fact that special emphasis has been placed during this debate on safe driving. Although all new drivers must now sit a preliminary theory test before receiving their first provisional licence, there is still insufficient emphasis on this aspect of driver proficiency. When I was involved in the insurance industry many years ago, I went to a good deal of trouble to identify how drivers could be better instructed off the road in simulated situations. There should be much greater emphasis on this type of instruction.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>New drivers can glean many useful tips from more experienced motorists. I once saw a programme on British television which illustrated the danger signs for which motorists should be alert. These included parked cars on either side of the road or the appearance of a football in the vehicle&rsquo;s path, for example. Some of these danger signals have been used in Irish television advertisements. Less experienced drivers may not be as alert to these warnings as someone who has been driving for longer. Although the speed limit in most built-up residential areas is generally 30 km/h, experienced drivers find it is not usually possible to attain that speed because they must always be alert to the danger of a child or pet running into the path of their vehicle.</P>
      <P>When instruction is given to learner motorists, greater emphasis should be placed on the ability to read the conditions of the road and to react quickly in particular circumstances. We must provide better certification of the ability of new drivers by ensuring we have a universally acceptable and sufficiently rigorous testing system that is based on the necessity that the newly certified driver has plenty of experience on and off the road. This is the situation for pilots who must train on the ground in a simulator for a long period before they are allowed into the air. This aspect of training should be utilised to a far greater extent in the area of road safety and driver testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to establish the driver testing and standards authority that will be responsible for the driver testing service. However, although this will be the primary function of the authority, its overall aims will not stop there. The role of driver testing in ensuring drivers reach an acceptable level of competence is important in the overall context of road safety. In carrying out these functions, therefore, the authority will have a general duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. In this way, the authority will have a significant role in encouraging better driving rather than simply testing driver <Col N="685"/>competence and in encouraging greater road safety rather than simply reducing the test backlog. This is a fundamental development and one which requires serious consideration.</P>
      <P>We all agree road safety is a subject that must be tackled on a number of different fronts and with the co-operation of a number of different agencies. We as policy-makers face many different challenges. These include the need to encourage better behaviour by motorists and other road users. We must ensure road users accept traffic rules and are aware those rules will be enforced. We must instill in them an appreciation of a shared duty to ensure the safety of others.</P>
      <P>The main challenge for the Government is to achieve the right balance between good legislation, enforcement, education and public awareness measures. It has attempted to strike that balance and, in doing so, has initiated significant road safety policies, many of which have been outlined by previous speakers. They include the initial roll-out of the penalty points scheme, the dedicated Garda traffic corps and the emphasis on driver education, behaviour and awareness, among many others.</P>
      <P>The marked reduction in road deaths in 2003 indicated some success in this area. However, the unwelcome increase in road fatalities during 2004 only served to highlight that more must be done if we are to tackle the problem effectively. It gives me no satisfaction to say the problem is getting worse. Like Deputy Durkan, I too commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the enforcement measures it has put in train. The Government continues to work in this area. The road safety strategy for 2004-06 specifically targets continued reduction in road accidents and road deaths. Measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement and engineering that will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. We could spend all afternoon teasing out the implications of the enforcement of all these aspects of the strategy.</P>
      <P>Driver competence and formation is another important aspect of the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy. This emphasis derives from research which shows that poor driving skills and even poorer driver behaviour have a significant impact on the number of road casualties. Driving is an acquired skill and a particularly demanding one on Ireland&rsquo;s busy roads. There is clear evidence to suggest the manner in which many new drivers are taught is unsatisfactory and that too many drivers take the test ill-prepared.</P>
      <P>For many, the training has tended to be about the minimum required to pass the driving test rather than reaching an acceptable level of practice, competence and confidence. If we can convince motorists there is a direct relationship between driver competence and road safety and between driver competence and lower insurance &mdash; there is evidence of the latter connection in <Col N="686"/>today&rsquo;s newspapers &mdash; we will have achieved something significant. If we convince drivers that better training from the beginning will benefit them directly and indirectly, we will see improved driving standards.</P>
      <P>That the authority will be responsible for the registration of driving instructors will add to the improvement of driving practices. Driving instructors are not currently regulated and it will be a matter for the authority to determine how best to fulfil its obligations in this area. The end result will be a register of skilled driving instructors who have passed appropriate tests of their competence to instruct and are endorsed by the authority for that purpose. This is an issue that has been ventilated for a long period. Deputy Finian McGrath may recall it was raised at a teacher conference some years ago in the context of a discussion of the role of teachers in driver education. I welcome the fact that the Minister has devised provisions for the establishment of a register of qualified instructors. Every other area of people instruction requires that practitioners have suitable qualifications and are appropriately registered.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I am confident the decision to establish the driver testing and standards authority represents another building block in our fight to reduce road fatalities. I also welcome the progressive elements of the legislation. For example, the Bill gives the board and staff of the authority the scope to be innovative in carrying out their functions. It allows for the authority to move beyond the basic task of testing and allows it to be more inventive in its approach to the development of better driving standards. While the board of the authority will ultimately decide the best approach to take, I suggest steps be taken towards closer liaison with the education sector, possibly to establish classes on driving theory in post-primary schools. This already happens in some schools. One of our famous rally drivers runs such a programme for transition year students. The uptake is very high and the success rate is quite impressive.</P>
      <P>To establish a programme which would ensure young drivers reach a higher standard of basic knowledge prior to receiving even their provisional driving licence would be a significant development and one worth considering. A particularly important objective of this legislation is to bring an end to excessive and unacceptable waiting times. We cannot ignore the fact there is a significant waiting list for driving tests throughout the country. Although improvements have certainly been made, the demand for driving tests continues at a high level. I welcome the initiative announced earlier this week where there will be a drive to ensure measures are taken to shorten the waiting lists by being innovative in the way driver testing can be done. As I am sure other speakers have said, it is very important we maintain standards. Even if we privatise a service, we <Col N="687"/>should not allow the current high standards to slip. We might complain about the long waiting list and the hassle involved in taking a driving test but standards are high and what happens afterwards is another issue which certainly merits examination.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the driver testing and standards authority means the necessary flexibility will be in place to respond to variations in demand and to manage numbers throughout the country. Although I do not believe provisional licence holders are, in general, unsafe on our roads, we need to reduce their number. The proportion of drivers currently relying on a provisional licence is 17% of all current licence holders and not the 380,000 which many of us believed, although the percentage is too high. We are determined to reduce this proportion significantly and the establishment of the authority should ensure we can offer driving tests more quickly than at present and thereby reduce the number of provisional driving licences.</P>
      <P>As the waiting times for a driving test become more manageable, the Minister has plans to bring forward appropriate amendments to the driver licensing regulations to discourage long-term reliance on provisional licences, which I welcome. After all, a provisional licence is not a driving licence and it should only allow a person to drive for the purpose of learning to drive. I have often thought we could usefully look at the measures in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom whereby one has an &ldquo;R&rdquo; on one&rsquo;s front windscreen and rear window for a year after one sits the driving test to indicate that one is still somewhat of a learner. One is always learning but sometimes when the test has been completed successfully and the &ldquo;L&rdquo; sign comes down, the speed is ramped up and standards are forgotten about a bit too readily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>A good teacher is always learning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but some teachers do not.</P>
      <P>Any improvements to the overall delivery and standard of the driving test introduced by this authority will also have significant benefits. There have been a number of improvements to the driving test in recent years, most notably the introduction of the driver theory test as well as a detailed report sheet which shows the test candidate where his or her driving skills are weak. The facility to apply on-line for the test was also introduced and has been well received. However, if we are to keep up with improving international standards, the Irish system will benefit from focused changes which I am confident this authority will implement as they arise.</P>
      <P>I understand some changes are to be brought about in the area of testing motorcycle drivers, which I welcome. Every morning and almost <Col N="688"/>every evening, I notice motorcyclists overtaking cars travelling at a slow speed on the route I take to work. Invariably, they are on the wrong side of the white line or they travel on the hard shoulder on one&rsquo;s blind side. A concerted effort must be made to improve the behaviour of motorcyclists. They are good at wearing helmets, at other things and at driving high-powered bikes but weaving in and out of traffic and crossing over continuous white lines is dangerous. I urge the traffic corps of the Garda to pay as much attention to that aspect of driving as is possible.</P>
      <P>There is an aspect of the proposals about which I have a concern. All politics are local. Although I would like to be contradicted and told I am wrong, I understand there are proposals to concentrate the testing of truck drivers in one particular test centre, the Finglas test centre on Jamestown Road. Notwithstanding that this centre is located in my constituency in which we do not want to see increased levels of heavy vehicles, I have a number of reservations about the idea. It would represent a backward step in driver testing. Rather than testing the level of competence a driver has with a heavy vehicle, we would be testing his or her ability to memorise a particular route and to be aware of particular junctions and familiar only with the traffic constrictions in one area. To pass this test would only involve committing this route to memory and would not necessarily illustrate competence in driving large or more dangerous vehicles. I am sure I am not alone in this House in having those reservations. I do not know whether it is because of a feeling this might happen in our area but there has been a huge increase in the number of driving schools running courses for truck drivers in the Finglas area clogging up roads and parking on and damaging footpaths. It is a matter which must be reviewed.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that in the driver licensing area, the day to day operation of the licensing system, including the provision of blank licences and forms to licensing authorities, would transfer to the authority. Of course, policy making in these areas and the making of driver licensing regulations will remain with the Department of Transport, which I welcome. After all, the licensing system not only controls drivers, but is also the system which records penalty points and disqualifications incurred by drivers for road traffic offences. I also approve of the continuing interaction between the specialised transport staff in the Department and the local licensing authorities. It is worth noting that in the area of penalty points, the record will be endorsed electronically through a card system between the Courts Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the vehicle registration unit. Currently, queries about the application of penalty points are dealt with by the Department of Transport but this function will now pass to the new authority.</P><Col N="689"/>
      
      <P>Given proposals before the European Parliament for consideration which aim to enhance security features on licences and which will require greater involvement at central level, the new authority will be the ideal body to facilitate such an arrangement because of the close connection between driver testing and driver licensing. If there is to be co-operation in this area, I wonder whether this facility might also play a greater role in combatting or at least in seeking justice for offences carried out on our roads by drivers licensed in other countries. My main experience of this is the speeding which occurs on the N2, often by vehicles registered in Northern Ireland. I am aware a similar authority has been established in the UK and it would beneficial if we could co-operate with it to bring these offenders to justice.</P>
      <P>I have a serious concern about truck drivers, especially from Northern Ireland and the UK but also mainland Europe who do not understand the implications of driving on the other side of the road. The same might apply to Irish truck drivers driving in mainland Europe. It would be useful if there was an awareness campaign by the road haulage associations or the relevant European bodies governing the licensing of the road haulage industry to highlight the need for better driver behaviour. Last Saturday evening I saw, I think, a Netherlands registered articulated truck negotiate one of the roundabouts on the M50. It all but sandwiched a small Fiat Punto against the safety barrier. Admittedly, that happens infrequently but once is too often. In some way or other, we should try to ensure all these issues are addressed.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a separate public body to deliver and improve on the driver testing service is an important development. Significantly, it will enable us to provide a superior and safe driver testing service. I prepared these remarks some time ago and am unsure whether the initiative announced earlier this week has superseded them. I am not anti-privatisation <i>per se</i> but have reservations about farming out important areas of public policy to the private sector, sometimes without adequate policing controlling powers. I hope that if measures such as these are introduced, we ensure they are carefully monitored. Many Members hear complaints reasonably regularly about inconsistencies in the application of the NCT test for car roadworthiness. Sometimes, how one fares depends on the centre to which one goes or on the particular tester at a centre.</P>
      <P>The authority to which I referred will have the necessary flexibility to take an innovative approach to the area of driver testing and I look forward to seeing what inventive and exciting ideas it can come up with. I recognise that the benefits will not be as immediate as those resulting from the targeting of the offences of speeding, seat belt wearing and drink driving. I am also mindful that these and any other <Col N="690"/>measures are only as good as the manner in which they are applied. In other words, there is no point in having a law unless it can be applied or implemented by the Garda when required. On that point, the Government must continue to deliver on the enforcement element of its strategy. Garda visibility is of the utmost importance and I look forward to the full implementation of that policy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Garda traffic corps. The Garda&rsquo;s visibility is certainly improving and the fact that it now has high visibility colouring on its motorcycles and four by fours is important. I have noticed a commendable increase in the number of spot checks on speeding. For example, on the N2 over the recent bank holiday, I saw more than one driver fall into the trap of driving carefully past a hand-held camera only to encounter, having accelerated, a fixed camera 500 m further on. It was nice to see the camera flashing every time someone drove by above the speed limit. Perhaps this might give the lie to those who feel not only that the camera lies from time to time but that it does not take pictures.</P>
      <P>A number of issues bother me personally. Some time ago, I raised one by way of a parliamentary question, namely, the advertising and sale of scanners. I know of one retail location where they are readily available, with a sandwich board on the footpath. One can acquire a scanner which purportedly ensures that one can drive over the limit without being detected by the Garda radar. What measures, if any, can the Minister take? Will he invoke legislation to ensure that the sale of such devices is illegal?</P>
      <P>If we foster the development and improvement of driving standards throughout the country, this will strengthen the overall strategy for road safety. The proposed driver and standards authority is a very important element in the process of improving road safety in general. I, therefore, commend the Minister on this Bill and welcome it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to speak on this Bill, which I welcome. I welcome its thrust, which is to cut the ridiculously long waiting times that people must endure to get a basic driving test. This must be welcomed. It will mean the end of the provisional licence anomaly which prevents applicants from getting a reasonable and convenient test date. Ultimately the Bill will prevent untrained and untested drivers from driving on our roads. One must question how this came about in the first place. The people responsible for it bear a great responsibility for our very high road accident figures. This problem has gone on for some time and must be rectified.</P>
      <P>Currently, the average waiting time for a test is ten months, which is far too long by any stretch of the imagination. I do not see why people must wait so long and I understand that this Bill seeks <Col N="691"/>to rectify the situation. I commend the Minister on the introduction of the Bill and for providing a bonus scheme that will award testers for extra productivity. This is to be welcomed although one must question why it is necessary. Nevertheless, if this is what is required to get people off the road or to get them tested, I welcome it. The provision to hire extra staff to carry out 40,000 tests on a once-off basis is more important. This is akin to the situation with the national treatment purchase fund which is a quick-fix solution to solve a particular problem. The national treatment purchase fund worked, but is still only a short-term, albeit a welcome, solution. I hope this initiative by the Minister will be equally successful in sorting solving the problem in the short term.</P>
      <P>One must question whether this will happen again and if the extra productivity award system is necessary to ensure it does not. I ask the Minister to address the long-term capability of the Department to ensure that the existing backlogs are dealt with and do not recur. This measure will ease the embarrassing backlog of 124,250 tests which would have existed by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>Another point concerns the need for young people on the road to drive safely. Young people are inclined to drive much faster and to be involved in more road accidents and many young lives have been wasted in this way. However, many people have questioned the high cost of car insurance in the past. In particular the penalisation structure affects young people with a provisional licence. I am sure their accident rate is much higher but they have been cornered into paying sky-high prices for car insurance. Young people are forced to fork out between &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000 simply to get a car on the road. We must keep an eye on this. I know that the T&aacute;naiste has launched some initiatives in this regard and this will help.</P>
      <P>The numbers of people taking the driving test surged from 180,000 in 2001 to 234,000 in 2003 as a result of the ban on people driving on provisional licences. The measure had to be welcomed but one must question whether it might have been possible to implement the change in a more phased manner. It might have prevented this backlog.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally however, we must question whether the public transport system is capable of handling the needs of the thousands of provisional licence holders who will now be obliged to use the bus or train, should they be forced to leave their cars at home. People, particularly young people, have great difficulty in getting to work, especially in rural areas. For instance, I have come across cases where young people have been completely unable to keep a job because of an inability to get car insurance. It is important that we allow our young people to make use of <Col N="692"/>transport but there must also be a balance to ensure that road safety standards are maintained.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>his views on whether, in the event of a partial sale of Aer Lingus, it would be possible to include a caveat in the sale agreement to ensure the retention of landing slots at Heathrow Airport by Dublin passengers; if he is actively considering such a clause; the action taken to examine this proposal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15715/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to see the slots being retained at Heathrow, regardless of the ownership structure of the national airline. I am very aware of the concerns raised about specific strategic issues in the context of any proposal to reduce the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Aer Lingus. These relate not only to the slots at Heathrow but to the Aer Lingus brand and direct services on the transatlantic routes.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not own any Heathrow slots. Aer Lingus holds these slots on the basis of &ldquo;grandfather rights&rdquo;, which are rights of historic precedence. Aer Lingus has around 4% of Heathrow slots &mdash; the fourth largest after BA, BMI and Lufthansa and operates in the region of 25 round trips daily in peak season. Apart from Aer Lingus, BMI is the only other operator on the Heathrow-Dublin route and there is no other operator to Heathrow from Cork or Shannon. It should be pointed out that Heathrow services are a key element in the Aer Lingus product and a key contributor to profits. I have no reason to believe this will not be the position into the future, whatever the ownership status of Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>However, as direct services increase to European and other points, the importance of Heathrow for international connectivity is diminishing. Also, the other major European hubs in Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam are continuing to grow and have good direct connections from Ireland with a range of airlines.</P><Col N="693"/>
        
        <P>EU Regulation 95/93, as amended by Regulation 793/2004 governs the allocation of slots at congested airports such as Heathrow. The current regulation allows for the retention of grandfather slots. It also allows for the exchange of slots but is silent on the issue of the sale of slots. However, this has not prevented the development of a &ldquo;grey market&rdquo; in slots where the practice of exchanging slots for cash has developed.</P>
        <P>The Commission published a study last year on potential mechanisms to develop market-orientated slot allocation schemes. A consultation paper later in the year was the follow-up to this study. The Commission is now developing its thinking on the potential mechanisms that could be included in draft legislation. My Department will continue to monitor developments at EU level regarding any proposed changes to the regulatory regime for slots.</P>
        <P>The current EU regulatory regime may change in the future. Accordingly, there is not an absolute guarantee that access to the current level of grandfather slots at Heathrow can be maintained indefinitely, even if the current ownership status of Aer Lingus remains the same.</P>
        <P>However, I assure the House that in the context of any decision to reduce State ownership in Aer Lingus, all the options available within the regulatory framework will be examined to ensure adequate ongoing access to Heathrow for Irish consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister that there is no reason to believe Aer Lingus will lose the Heathrow slots or that the market will not dictate that those slots will remain and be used for the benefit of Irish passengers. It is probably true that if the market was to change, there is very little the Government, as a minority owner, could do to ensure that a majority owner did not sell on the slots. I know that the EU has adjudicated on similar issues.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree, given that we will have little or no control over slots in the long term, it is extremely important that Aer Lingus is equipped to develop more direct routes, particularly long-haul routes, to lessen its dependence on Heathrow as a hub? Does the Minister agree that it is worrying that on the very day a private operator launches new routes from Cork to the United States, Aer Lingus is threatening to withdraw routes from Dublin to the United States, for example, the routes to Los Angeles and Orlando? Does he not agree that this is an example of how Aer Lingus is almost being run into the ground through lack of decision-making about its future? Events are taking place all over the world that are placing Aer Lingus at a disadvantage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have set out as openly as I can, in the context of a parliamentary question, the facts surrounding Heathrow slots. Both Deputy Mitchell and I agree that Heathrow slots are <Col N="694"/>crucial. Any major strategic holding the State would have in Aer Lingus would be very significant in dictating some of the strategic issues. Any company would want to maintain the slots. At a European level, an attempt is being made to develop a regulatory framework to deal with this issue. The Department and I have been closely involved in these discussions but they have not resulted in a definitive mechanism for creating a market for slots at Heathrow.</P>
        <P>I agree that the other hubs of Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt have experienced significant growth and they will continue to grow. Aer Lingus is beginning to take more advantage of these hubs in terms of route selection. Dublin Airport has an opportunity to become a hub of some significance. I believe this because the airport is well placed in terms of its strategic location for long-haul and short-haul flights. If people with views on the general debate on Aer Lingus would think outside the box, they would see a different picture. There is enormous growth from Ireland into the United States and Aer Lingus is in a position to take advantage of that. Opportunities also exist to expand into eastern markets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that there is a need for a runway, terminal and a CEO for Aer Lingus before we begin talking about Dublin Airport becoming a hub?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had great success with the new CEO of Aer Lingus and I wish him well. Any significant airline would have been delighted to recruit a CEO of his quality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have been better if Aer Lingus could have kept the previous CEO.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Aer Lingus has a business plan and I urge all sides to implement it. This plan is crucial to the airline&rsquo;s survival in the long term, regardless of what the future strategic structure of Aer Lingus turns out to be. The plan also provides the basis for enormous growth by developing many new routes, both short-haul flights within Europe and long-haul flights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</P>
        <?oasys _dc14-?>
        <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I am currently finalising proposals for the provision of additional terminal capacity at Dublin Airport for consideration by Government very shortly. There are two crucial issues guiding the overall consideration of how terminal capacity will be provided at Dublin Airport. We must ensure the continued overall operational integrity and strategic development of Dublin Airport to meet the needs of current and future users of the airport, both airlines and passengers. It will be necessary to ensure that additional terminal capacity is provided within a reasonable time frame to meet the growth in air traffic. Projected growth in passenger traffic drives the timing and scale of the investment required.</P>
        <?oasys _dc0-?>
        <P>Under existing legislation, the Dublin Airport Authority owns and is responsible for the operation, management and development of Dublin Airport. That is the legislative mandate given to the authority. As policy maker, the State must be satisfied that any future framework for the provision of terminal capacity at the airport, covering both the development and operation of such facilities, ensures the optimum development of Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>Once the Government makes a decision with regard to the provision of capacity, the detailed planning and implementation process will address the issue of the optimum location of the terminal. As a general principle, the objective is to use available assets as effectively as possible in the interests of the efficient operation of Dublin Airport. As regards the timetable for the project, clearly considerable emphasis will be placed on implementing the project as quickly as possible to meet projected passenger growth and the aim is to have new capacity in place in 2009. The request for expressions of interest in August 2002 was a preliminary canvassing of the market to test the level of interest in and feasibility of the independent terminal concept. These expressions were then examined by the Mullarkey panel. The expressions did not identify working examples of independent competing terminals and the panel noted this concept had no corollary elsewhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked the Minister two specific questions about the proposed second terminal but he has not answered either. Can he point to any example of competing terminals in any European airport? Is there a model we are following?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is not.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="696"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>If this is such a wonderful idea in the eyes of the Cabinet, why do other airports not do this? On the concept of competing terminals, which has not been questioned anywhere in the media during this debate in recent months, what is the basis on which two terminals would compete given that the critical areas of baggage handling and check-in are in the control of airlines and airport charges, a major issue, are controlled by the aviation regulator? Does the Minister accept that the concept of competing airport terminals is flawed? Why is the Cabinet continuing with this nonsensical debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have enunciated clearly my point of view that there are no independent competing terminals. Deputy Shortall is right. The only place this was tried was Montreal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Toronto.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Toronto. Airport charges in the private facility turned out to be four times higher.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I know, but the Minister is a member of a Government that is suggesting we should have competing terminals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am giving the Deputy my perspective as Minister for Transport on the matter, which is what she asked me to do. There are no examples of competing terminals and I am concerned about how this would work when it does not work anywhere else in the world.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Why are we toying with the idea?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Where it has been tried, it was an abject failure ultimately resulting in the State buying back the terminal at an exorbitant cost.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>We know that but why is the Cabinet considering it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Views have been expressed and questions have been asked. People are entitled to ask legitimate questions about many issues, with which I have no difficulty. To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly, I spent every day over recent months dealing with this issue. I am on solid ground when I say I agree with the Deputy that I cannot find an example of the type she has enunciated today anywhere in the world. I have stated this publicly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Then it is a flawed concept.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The type does not exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not exist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>All I can do is make a judgment call on the basis that, where it was tried, it was an <Col N="697"/>abject failure with charges being four times higher in the privately run facility and the state eventually buying it back. Of the 13 expressions of interest, one that was submitted by an airline argued against the concept of an independent or competing terminal, only five could be regarded as clear in terms of concept and location and none gave clear answers regarding the financial and economic dimensions of such a proposal. Only one gave a suggestion of a landing charge, which was in the order of &euro;8.50 in comparison with the &euro;4.90 charge in Dublin Airport at present. So much for this type of competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister about the lack of examples of competing terminals and that this is a step in the dark. Does the Minister agree that it was irresponsible of his Department and his predecessor to search for expressions of interest and to put 13 firms and a 14th firm more recently to the expense of making proposals if there was no intention of pursuing them? I have heard the Minister express the view that his mandate and that of the Dublin Airport Authority is to provide the services of Dublin Airport by maximising the use of its lands. Does the Minister not agree that the constrained nature of the site means that it is too small and that every report that has ever been made on the matter, including the DAA&rsquo;s, states the location will always be inherently inefficient, not just during the construction phase, and will need to be replaced by the famous third terminal even if we do go ahead with this project?</P>
        <P>Why is the Minister fixated on this site given all that is wrong with it and the indications from reports that it is not the right site? Has this to do with not upsetting the Taoiseach and, therefore, not upsetting the Taoiseach&rsquo;s unions? Surely the only issue that matters is that Dublin can compete with other capital city airports and not just with terminals within Ireland. This is the type of competition we need and the type we must face up to. What matters is getting the right site that is big enough to give us growth capacity and not who owns it. The DAA must go out and search for business. It has had it so easy as business has come to it but it has made no effort to accommodate this business over the past ten years. Extra capacity is needed if the DAA is to compete with other airports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>On the information that has been presented to me, I disagree with the Deputy in terms of some of the suggestions that several sites that have been decided on are inadequate. As I said in my answer, it is a matter for the Dublin Airport Authority to choose a site. I have no evidence that suggests the authority, as a new body of fine people, many of whom are experts in this area, will knowingly do something that is not in the interests of Irish aviation, airlines and passengers.</P><Col N="698"/>
        
        <P>The DAA and the construction of a new second terminal must have the airlines on board as they are the key users of the facility. In a wider context, it is obvious in light of the current configuration of Dublin Airport that there is a tremendous opportunity to create one of the best hubs in Europe in terms of integration between long haul and short haul for the airlines and ease of access between passengers and their baggage, as Deputy Shortall said. These matters are for the DAA to address. Deputy Shortall is correct in that the Commission for Aviation Regulation is the independent arbiter that will dictate the charging regime in the airport. The regulator will not allow for over-capacity but only allow the costs of what is required for capacity. We will plan on this basis. I do not have an issue with planning ten or 15 years beyond what we believe will be required until 2015 but we must have an airport that is for the Irish people.</P>
        <P>On behalf of the Government, I am the guardian of the taxpayers&rsquo; investment in this facility which is one the key strategic pieces of infrastructure in this country. The airport should be in State hands. I have not seen evidence from any other country to suggest otherwise and I want to progress on this basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance that the very notion of competing terminals is flawed and it is about time someone said this. That not a single person in the media has questioned this concept over the past six months or so is extraordinary. Does the Minister accept that the battle that has been taking place inside the Cabinet in recent months is nonsense given that there is no such thing as successful competing terminals? Why has the Minister not convinced his partners in Government that this is nonsense? Why can we not have a decision to proceed with the much needed expansion of the facility in Dublin Airport? Do the Minister&rsquo;s partners in Government not understand the logic of what we are talking about? Has he not managed to convince them that there is no such thing as successful competing terminals? For the sake of the travelling public, will the Minister get that message across to them and get on with the job of expanding the facilities? The issue at Dublin Airport is capacity, not competition, and the Minister should be able to convince his partners of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel there is a breakdown in communication between the Minister and the Dublin Airport Authority. He keeps saying it is up to the authority to provide a terminal, which is true, but it is not up to it to provide it on its own lands. That is a where there is a difficulty between the Minister and the Dublin Airport Authority. When the chairman of that authority appeared before a committee he stated clearly that if he were asked to provide a terminal, his responsibility would be to maximise the value of <Col N="699"/>the airport&rsquo;s lands. Therefore, he could only present the airport&rsquo;s lands as the site for the terminal. However, he went on to say that if he wanted the use the optimum lands, the site would not necessarily be the airport&rsquo;s lands. That is the nub of the issue. It is an issue of the site having adequate capacity. I realise that the regulator will not give approval for an increase in landing charges beyond what is required at present, but at least we must have a terminal which we can improve in the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not disagree with that view. In response to Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s remarks, there has been considerable misrepresentation in this debate. People are entitled to ask legitimate questions, but the word &ldquo;competition&rdquo; and &ldquo;being competitive&rdquo; have been completely mixed up and presented as meaning the same thing, but they do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;to come up with an optimum solution.</P>
        <P>In regard to what Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, there is no disagreement on that. I want the optimum result at Dublin Airport in terms of the terminal. Practically all the airlines agree on what the site should be for much greater reasons than simply putting in place a piece of infrastructure. That is what I have been trying to say for the past few months.</P>
        <P>I am aware of what airlines have been saying to the Dublin Airport Authority. Everybody is suddenly thinking outside the box. They are taking account of the bigger picture in terms of what they can get in benefit from the right decision being made on the terminal. They are also taking account of how they can increase the traffic, improve operations and marry the clearly tremendous opportunities in short-haul flights, <Col N="700"/>the low cost end of the business which is growing on all routes. Equally, there is massive opportunity for Aer Lingus in terms of long-haul flights. If we got a coherent result on the operational side between long-haul and short-haul flights for the benefit of the passenger, we would be in business. Dublin will be a formidable hub compared to some of the other European airports.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>when it is intended to introduce an integrated ticketing system into the public transport system.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15718/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>In March 2002, the Railway Procurement Agency was given statutory responsibility for the delivery of an integrated ticketing system. The proposed contactless smartcard-based integrated ticketing system will enable a passenger to use a ticket on one or more scheduled public transport services, by road and rail, irrespective of the transport operator involved. It will be introduced on a phased basis, initially in the Dublin area. The roll-out of integrated ticketing using smartcard technology is being phased in, in line with international experience.</P>
        <P>In April 2004 a private operator, Morton&rsquo;s Coaches, in conjunction with the RPA and as a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo;, successfully launched smartcards on its services. Last March, another step was taken with the launch of smartcards on Luas <Col N="701"/>services. The Luas smartcard deployment will help obtain important feedback from passengers and provide operational experience for the next stage of integrated ticketing.</P>
        <P>The RPA projects that Dublin Bus, and possibly some additional private operators, will follow with smartcards on their services by early next year, with the DART projected to follow in late 2006. In early 2006 passengers should be able to travel on both bus and Luas services in Dublin using one integrated smartcard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The introduction of some level of integrated ticketing would be welcome. The notion of this idea dates back to the putting in place of the Dublin transportation initiative which was drawn up to make an application for European funding because Dublin city had become uncompetitive due to congestion. We would laugh if we compared the level of congestion at the time the initiative was put in place to the current level. The manner in which it is proposed to introduce the system seems piecemeal. That flies in the face of what integrated ticketing means. The system should be integrated from the day it is introduced. There is an element of paralysis in introducing integrated ticketing in that what is at issue is more to do with who runs the services rather than the arrangements at the other end, which should be the issue in a fully integrated ticketing system.</P>
        <P>The report on an integrated ticketing system was received by the then Minister for Transport, the former Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke, in 1999. We have now heard that there will a phased roll-out of the system. While I welcome the fact that there will be some level of ticketing integration, and we are moving towards a fully integrated ticketing system, I am disappointed the full system will not be introduced in a shorter timeframe and that the system will not be fully integrated from the day it is introduced.</P>
        <P>From the point of view of the amount of money that was spent on the transport system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred to the phased introduction of the system. Will it be phased in as between private and public service providers or exclusively by public service providers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the system to be available to everybody who provides a public transport service here. That is the way the customer wants the system to work, namely, to facilitate ease of movement in terms of whatever mode of transport the customer chooses to use. I wish to clarify that the timeframe for the introduction of this system is four years. That 2002-06 timeframe is the best in terms of the world norm.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has not, to date, carried out an analysis on the future tolling of the M50. The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads and to enter toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part VI of the Roads Act 1993, as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000. Tolling of the M50, therefore, and any changes to the current tolling arrangements, is a matter, in the first instance, for the NRA. Given the transport policy issues involved, however, my approval would also be required for changes in current tolling arrangements.</P>
        <P>In the context of the overall upgrade of the M50 the NRA is negotiating and seeking to agree with NTR a strategy for the upgrade of that section of the M50 operated by NTR, that is, the section between the Navan Road and Galway Road interchanges and the West Link toll facility. A key objective of these negotiations will be to agree a strategy for the move to barrier-free tolling on the M50. The conduct of these negotiations is a matter for the NRA and the final <Col N="703"/>outcome will be submitted for my approval. For the sake of clarity, I have asked both sides to achieve this. Barrier-free tolling is a must.</P>

	<P>The Minister has my sympathy, having inherited the greatest mess in the history of transport, a mess which is not of his making. Last week we heard of the incredible waste of &euro;20 billion expenditure on roads in terms of the building of 800 kilometres of motorway leading to this one road. I am sure the Minister will accept, as An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Taoiseach have, that it will not work. Does the Minister&rsquo;s Department not have a role in deciding funding of the upgrading of the M50? Does it include an analysis on whether we should have an extension of tolling on the West Link toll bridge to pay for the second stage of the upgrade of the M50? Is the Department engaged in discussions and negotiations on the process and, if not, can we take it for granted that the NRA&rsquo;s position, which was presented to a committee of this House, that the road will not work means there will have to be different demand management measures, which An Bord Plean&aacute;la requires? Will this require a different tolling system on the M50 because everyone acknowledges that the current West Link toll facility has no demand management facility? If the Department is not engaged in that process, I presume the NRA&rsquo;s position is the one that will be advanced by Government. Has the Minister a view on the matter or when will his Department become involved? I understood that it was already involved.</P>

	<P>No one disagrees with barrier-free tolling. That is not the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me move to my second point. We are increasing the capacity of the M50 by 50%, which is substantial. It will be of great benefit to road users in that area. There is no doubt that we will have to move to demand management of traffic in Dublin. However, before moving fully to that position, I want to give people in Dublin and those who visit the capital city a choice of public transport access into the city. This is the fairest way to deal with the matter. I will not penalise or punish people by <Col N="704"/>not having in place alternative facilities but, ultimately, the growth in traffic will require demand management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the position of the engineer consultants presented to An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s hearing, the Dublin Transportation office engineers and the NRA itself was that such demand management measures should not be in the form of traffic lights on these freeflow junctions and that it would have to be a new form of tolling? Does he accept that his Department should carry out an analysis on whether it should buy out the West Link toll bridge and consider an alternative system which would provide some sort of demand management facilities, as is being considered for the M25 widening in London? Does the Minister believe this is the way we should go or what is the alternative?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I already answered the Deputy&rsquo;s question twice, but obviously he does not agree with my reply. I agree that there must be demand management in the future. There are many different ways of doing so; it does not necessarily mean tolling all the exits and entrances on the M50. This is one of the options which is suggested. I agree with the Deputy that there should not be traffic lights which would stop the flow of traffic. There needs to be a freeflow traffic system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that we would also have to buy out the West Link?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The income streams from the toll bridge are used by the State for the upgrading of the M50, which is extremely important and much warranted. I welcome the project which has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and is now under way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That use of future funds from the West Link toll bridge to pay for the M50 relates to the extension of tolling on the West Link bridge from 2020 to 2035. Given that the toll facility has no demand management functions and never can have, how can the Minister propose that approach when he admitted that by 2020 we will need some sort of demand management measures? Why is he tying us into a tolling system that is all about revenue generation and not about demand management? It makes no sense.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is missing my point. I have already spoken to the NRA and NTR, two commercial operations. The NRA operates independently but on behalf of the State. It must negotiate with NTR. It is exploring many options with regard to substantial improvements and tolling on the M50. I look forward to the conclusion of the discussions and to the NRA coming back <Col N="705"/>to me with proposals. I have a very open mind on what can be achieved. I want to achieve a much better operation of the M50.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 17, 57, 65 and 72 together.</P>
        <P>In keeping with the provisions of the State Airports Act 2004, the board of the Dublin Airport Authority has a statutory mandate to do everything necessary to give effect to the restructuring of the State airports. The Shannon and Cork airport authorities were incorporated in October 2004 and in line with the framework provided by the State Airports Act 2004, these two new authorities will in due course own and operate their respective airports once sufficient distributable reserves are available to transfer the relevant assets.</P>
        <P>Prior to the assets of Shannon and Cork airports being vested in their respective authorities, their boards are charged with preparing to assume full responsibility for the management and development of their airports. They are also <Col N="706"/>empowered to undertake functions delegated to them on an agreed basis by the Dublin Airport Authority. Each of the airport authorities is also required to prepare comprehensive business plans for their airports. As part of this process, the Dublin Airport Authority will consider the future direction of its business, including the position of its subsidiaries.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the 2004 Act, the transfer of assets to Shannon and Cork airport authorities cannot take place earlier than 30 April 2005 and, thereafter, a phased approach will allow one of the new airport authorities to be vested first, that is, Shannon Airport, while Cork Airport will be vested once sufficient distributable reserves have been built up within the Dublin Airport Authority.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and I must be satisfied as to the state of operational and financial readiness of the Shannon and Cork airport authorities before the assets of the airports are vested in those authorities. The formulation of comprehensive business plans by the new boards will be a key aspect of achieving operational and financial readiness. The three airport authorities are preparing comprehensive business plans with the Dublin Airport Authority co-ordinating the process. Finalised business plans have not yet been submitted.</P>
        <P>As part of its business plan, the Dublin Airport Authority will be putting forward its proposals for the future of the Great Southern Hotels group. I have had discussions with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about the Great Southern Hotels group and I am aware of their importance to Irish tourism. I will consider the DAA&rsquo;s proposals in consultation with the Minister for Finance in the overall context of the business plans as provided for under the State Airports Act 2004.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister accept that the break-up of Aer Rianta is not quite as simple as his predecessor suggested and we are a long way from disentangling that company? I am sure he is grateful to him for the legacy he has left him.</P>
        <P>On the Great Southern hotels chain, does the Minister accept that clarity is needed for the staff of the hotels, given the role they have played in the tourism industry and that it has been a flagship company which has made a significant contribution to raising standards and providing very high quality training opportunities for staff in the industry? Does he agree that the staff need some clarity in respect of their future? Last month the chairman of the airport authority indicated clearly that it was his intention to dispose of the hotels, yet the Minister is giving staff reassurances that this will not happen and, as long as the Government is in power, the chain will remain in public ownership. These are two diametrically opposed positions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="707"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Deputy a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify for the staff of the Great Southern Hotels group what exactly lies ahead of them in terms of their job security and job prospects for the future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully understand the importance of the Great Southern Hotels group, about which I have spoken to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. While I do not wish to pre-empt the business plans, I have met the people in Cork, Shannon and Dublin and there is great enthusiasm for what is happening. The opportunities that independence will bring to Shannon and Cork have been well greeted and they are up for the challenges.</P>
        <P>The redistribution of the assets is a complex process. All the issues that filter into that must be dealt with. People have different perspectives on different aspects. I am anxious that the Great Southern Hotels group has a major future.</P>
        <P>There are many factors that can make that happen, including the management and staff in the hotels. One of the difficulties at present is that the hotel group is losing substantial amounts of money. This is not sustainable for anybody, including the staff. It is not good from its perspective. Clearly, the restructuring process must involve a consideration of how we can maximise the benefit of the Great Southern Hotels group and return it to profit.</P>
        <P>There has been considerable investment in tourism and hotels in recent years and there is no reason, therefore, that Great Southern Hotels should not be very profitable and to the fore in the industry. I would like to see this happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister consider it fair, either to the hotels or the fledgeling Dublin Airport Authority, to leave the hotels in the care of an organisation that admits it does not have the interest, finance or ability necessary to run hotels? Running hotels is not what the authority does or what it is good at. Does it not have enough to do in running airports? Does it not behove the Minister to remove the hotels from the care of the authority for the sake of both the hotels and the airport?</P>
        <P>It does not seem to be in anybody&rsquo;s interest to allow these circumstances to persist. The annual loss of &euro;2.2 million represents a drain not just on the hotels but on the airport. It has considerable implications for the fledgeling airport authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the benefits of our current position is that we engage in serious business planning. It is difficult to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question in that I have not got the business plan. However, Dublin Airport Authority has made is absolutely clear that, in the business planning process, all the issues concerning the subsidiaries of the authority, which formerly existed in the <Col N="708"/>guise of Aer Rianta, must be dealt with. I am waiting to see what these issues are. The chairman has enunciated fairly some of the issues that must be grappled with.</P>
        <P>Having considered the tourism market and the history of the Great Southern Hotels and the contribution they have made, I know of no reason the hotels could not and should not be very profitable. The hotel business is largely profitable. There are issues for management and staff in the Great Southern Hotels group to reconcile. If this reconciliation is achieved, it will help to return the hotels to profitability. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and I have discussed this issue informally and I share his views.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Minister must see the business plans. As of now, does he have an inkling as to whether the hotels should or could be kept in public ownership? He stated he had discussions with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. Had he any communications with the Taoiseach on this issue? In any such communications, has the Taoiseach expressed a view on whether the assets should be kept in State ownership?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The history of the Great Southern Hotels group is clear. I have no objection to maintaining Great Southern Hotels in State ownership, if it remains profitable. However, the hotels must be run efficiently and well in terms of the mix in the tourism market and the hotel business, which is very competitive. There is no reason the group should not remain in State ownership.</P>
        <P>I am in the difficult position of having to proceed without the business plans. I do not want to pre-empt or speculate on what might be in them. It is fair to those who are putting them together that I wait until the Minister for Finance and I receive them. In light of the viability of all the entities the Minister for Finance and I must approve the entire process in which we are engaged and the completion of the business plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister had any indication from the Taoiseach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been much general discussion. The Government, including the Taoiseach, is anxious to see the business plans produced. The Taoiseach has been very clear that he believes the Great Southern Hotels group is an important element in the public sector and would like to see it remain in that sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Taoiseach made that view known to the Minister?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>He said that publicly on numerous occasions.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="709"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>On airports generally, rather than hotels, comfort was offered to both Cork and Shannon airports in respect of the financial status of their respective authorities, as the Minister is aware. When the State Airports Bill was passed, everybody understood the authorities would be free of debt, if established. There is great concern in Cork that this position may have changed, as I am sure the Minister is aware. There are indications that the Minister is of a different view to the people in Cork. This may be because of overruns associated with the terminal or losses pertaining to some of the assets of the former Aer Rianta.</P>
        <P>In fairness to Cork people generally, and to allow the authority to prepare its plan, it is important that those concerned know precisely what they are facing. Has the Minister changed his mind? Has the Government changed its mind regarding the setting up of Cork and Shannon airport authorities without debt? Is the corollary such that any outstanding debt would remain with Dublin Airport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The transfer of assets to Shannon and Cork airport authorities could not have taken place earlier than April of this year. For the company to distribute its assets, it must have the cash reserves to match the distributive value of those assets. The early indications were that Shannon Airport would be dealt with first and that it might take some time to deal with Cork Airport. However, it is absolutely clear that Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports will have to be viable on foot of the business plans. There is no point in proceeding if they cannot be made viable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>If they are set up with debt, how can they be viable?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister to contribute without interruption. The Deputy cannot rise without being called by the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>The whole point was that they would be set up without debt.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I know of no business that does not have some debt attaching to it. There were many interpretations of some of the comments made at an early phase. I had meetings with representatives of Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports and there is no question but that everybody wants the airports to become independent as quickly as possible. People want Cork and Shannon airports to operate on the most viable and commercially sound grounds. I will wait for the business plans before demonstrating how this is to be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on Deputy Shortall to make a brief final question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>My question was not answered.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="710"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but I have called Deputy Shortall. We are rapidly running out of time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the comments made by Gary McGann to the members of the Joint Committee on Transport to the effect that the three business plans were far from finalised and that there were major problems associated with agreeing them?</P>
        <P>What of the former Minister&rsquo;s talk of Cork and Shannon airports starting off on a clean slate? Does the Minister, Deputy Cullen, accept that a political decision needs to be taken on the future of Aer Rianta International and the Great Southern Hotels group before the business plans can be finalised?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies Shortall and Olivia Mitchell are making my point for me. I am being asked to answer quite legitimate questions, with which I have no issue, but I cannot do so in advance of seeing the business plans. The plans must contain the answers to the questions the Deputies have raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They are political decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us produce the business plans first. We are often accused of trying to shoot in the dark without obtaining the facts. The Deputy should allow me to obtain the facts on the business plans. We will have to make decisions on foot of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>They are based on the availability of facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How can that be done when the authorities do not know the future of the money-making facet of the business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall should allow the Minister to contribute without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>What was Deputy Shortall&rsquo;s question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How can any of the airport authorities decide on its future without knowing what will happen to the money-making facet of the business, Aer Rianta International? The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor gave very clear signals of his intentions in this regard. Does the Minister not have to make what is ultimately a political decision on what is to happen to Aer Rianta International?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the Minister replies, I will allow a brief question from Deputy Olivia Mitchell.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="711"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is similar to that of Deputy Shortall. The business plans are predicated on the availability of certain facts. Cork Airport Authority, for instance, began planning on the basis that it would start off without debt. Now it does not know. How can it prepare the business plans without that information? Deputy Shortall is right, political decisions must be made so that the business plans can be realistic.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no disagreement between the three of us on this matter. The discussions between Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports deal with those issues. They are making decisions based on the hard facts of what is profitable and what is not, and the best structure for the future. Some political decisions may need to be taken as an outcome of that business plan.</P>
        <P>I have given these sound business people a strategic mandate to operate the three State airports successfully, commercially and profitably. They are discussing the issues in that mandate and will make the division on that sound basis.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Which airport will get Aer Rianta?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not like to mislead the House. Business planning is going on between the three airports under the direction of Dublin Airport Authority. The three airports are working out with the authority how these business plans stack up. One cannot make a business plan unless one possesses all the facts. They have the commercial facts. I am waiting for the business plans to come back, which may require us to make some political decisions.</P>

        <Quest>the number of passenger diversions from Cork Airport to other airports to date in 2005.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The movement of aircraft at Cork Airport is an operational matter for the airport authorities and the airlines concerned, subject to compliance with aviation safety requirements. However, I am informed by the Dublin Airport Authority that for the first four months of this year, 1.8% of planned arrivals at Cork Airport were diverted or cancelled, compared to an average annual diversion rate of approximately 1%. The main reason for this excess above the norm was a particularly bad spell of bad weather during March when the diversion rate reached 3.8%. Overall, I am informed that the rate of diversions at Cork Airport is in line with international statistics. Ultimately, a decision to land or divert an aircraft is a matter for the pilot, having regard to all safety requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is interesting in our new divided world to hear a response to a question regarding Cork Airport coming from Dublin Air<Col N="712"/>port. It seems the business plans must come from Dublin Airport before we can hear them. Does the Minister agree that for lack of a small investment, in the order of &euro;15 million, Cork Airport could have a navigational system which would allow planes to land even during fogbound periods? The lack of that investment hampers Cork Airport in its competition with Shannon or Dublin airports, if the three airports truly compete. Who makes such a decision? Does Dublin Airport make the decision, given that the Minister said all three airports must get together to discuss their business plans? Is it left to Cork Airport alone? If Cork Airport has no cash, assets or certainty about the source of its money, how can it decide on a practical measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is a case of serious business planning to split one organisation into three. The three parts must be party to the discussions. That is reasonable and sound. I do not have the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s technical question and am not going to guess it. In my response to the initial question I said that the diversion rate of 1% at Cork Airport is well in line with international norms.</P>

	<P>Table 1 sets out the numbers waiting and the average waiting time at each driving test centre on 9 May 2005. Table 2 sets out the number of driver testers, including supervisory testers, employed by my Department between 1997 and 2005. My Department and the Department of Finance have agreed a package of measures which includes increased productivity, the recruitment of additional testers and the out<Col N="713"/>sourcing of a block of tests. These measures have a potential to reduce the numbers awaiting a test by up to 80,000. Consultations with staff interests have commenced on the implementation of these measures.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s announcement on Tuesday about reducing waiting lists for driving tests sounded well, but people should not get too excited because his predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, made a similar announcement in February 2003. Does the Minister accept that there are now longer waiting lists for the driving test and fewer testers? There is fewer than one tester for every 1,000 people on the waiting list.</P>
        <P>The Minister announced a package on Tuesday promising to cut the waiting list to a month within the next 18 months. Where does he propose to find the driver testers? Are there qualified driver testers waiting to be employed? How does he propose to train recruits to bring them up to the standard that prevails? How does he propose to ensure that the standards are sufficiently high in the testing undertaken by private sector operators? How will he ensure even standards between public and private sector testers? Surely it would make more sense to set up the driving standards authority and recruit additional staff to that authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Department of Finance has supported the measures I proposed and I thank the Minister for Finance for that. The number of testers employed is substantially larger than it was. I do not know why the Deputy says there are fewer now. I can give her the figures <Col N="715"/>if she wishes. There are 129 testers and several vacancies, which I intend to fill immediately.</P>
        <P>We have appointed a new chief executive officer to lead the driving standards authority. Under his aegis the authority will put a block of tests out to tender in the market. He has assured me this is possible. We will incentivise our own driver testers on the number of tests carried out over a base figure of so many tests per day. Approximately 40,000 of the backlog of 80,000 tests will be carried out by our testers and the balance by outside testers. My wish is that the backlog will be cleared by the end of next year when the waiting time will be a matter of weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Where will the Minister find the testers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The new chief executive of the driving standards authority says they are available. Some training will be needed to ensure uniformity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>I should hope so. What are the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in that regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The training will ensure uniformity and consistency in the standard of driver testing across the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>How does the Minister propose to do that training?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The authority will train the testers. That is why we are setting up the authority. I am told by all sides, including internally, that it will achieve this. It will be done if there is a will to do it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be training themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am an optimist. I believe that one can get through problems if one sticks to the facts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is naive.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 37 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>On completion of the recent EU inspection of Dublin Airport, officials from my Department and the Dublin Airport Authority received an oral briefing on the findings of the inspection. I have received a report from my officials on the outcome of that debriefing. In accordance with established procedures and practice, my Department, the European Commission or the Dublin Airport Authority will not make any comment on the specific outcomes of the EU inspection. The European Commission will send a formal report to my Department in due course dealing with all relevant issues. This is a confidential security report and will not be published.</P>
        <P>I am determined that any issues identified during the inspection will be remedied. Apart from the immediate remedial actions put in place during the inspection, I have instructed my officials to prepare an action plan in response to the Commission findings. This action plan has been prepared in consultation with the Dublin Airport Authority, airlines and other stakeholders. I expect all relevant authorities will fully engage and co-operate with my Department to ensure there is full and consistent application of the required security measures.</P>
        <P>The House will understand that the nature of security precludes detailed discussion of measures. Therefore, I will not disclose the nature or extent of any security measures that have been implemented or the nature of any additional measures that are under consideration. However, I am satisfied that the DAA and airlines responded effectively and immediately to deficiencies identified during the inspection. In this regard, the DAA has appointed an international security firm to review security at Dublin Airport. I welcome the fact that it has done that. The National Civil Aviation Security Committee met last Thursday, 5 May 2005, and was briefed on the audit and the proposed action plan.</P>
        <P>On the issue of delays, I have been advised that the DAA is monitoring passenger movement and <Col N="717"/>controls to minimise inconvenience and delays and it is liaising closely with airlines. The authority has advised me that they will maximise the use of existing facilities and will endeavour to manage airport processes effectively to cope with the increasing passenger numbers passing through the terminal. The authority operates 14 X-ray screening points for passenger screening purposes, an increase of three new screening points since the EU inspection. Refurbishment works are under way to accommodate an additional two X-ray screening points and additional X-ray equipment has been ordered.</P>
        <P>By June, 120 new staff will have been recruited for screening operations and 40 of these new staff have already been brought into live screening operation. The DAA has also implemented a queue management system for crowd control purposes. Airlines are co-operating by opening check-in desks earlier. I welcome this important measure. Passengers have also been encouraged to minimise the volume of hand baggage presented at the screening points, not to carry sharp objects and to co-operate with the instructions of screeners. The DAA has informed me that the queue times average 15 minutes at peak periods during weekdays and 25 minutes at the busiest holiday traffic period at the weekends. During off-peak periods passenger queue times average not more than five minutes.</P>
        <P>I am committed to ensuring the highest standards of aviation security at our airports and I will ensure that the lessons learned from the EU inspection are taken on board. Specifically I will ensure that the security issues are addressed in co-operation with the relevant parties so that there is full confidence in the security arrangements and that those arrangements are managed in such a way as to minimise passenger inconvenience.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that about this time last year, reporters from a Sunday newspaper attempted to bring bomb-making equipment through Dublin and Shannon airports? They had no difficulty in doing so and wrote an article about it. Subsequently I asked a question of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. Will the current Minister tell the House about the system in his Department to monitor airport security? His predecessor said that he had full confidence in the airport security system and that it was being constantly reviewed by this committee, which is chaired by his Department. The committee assured everyone that there was tight security to the highest standards at Dublin Airport. How did Dublin Airport so spectacularly fail the standards required by this EU committee when last year the Minister&rsquo;s Department assured everyone that everything was under control and that it was perfectly happy with the security standards in Dublin Airport? What role, if any, has that committee played in the Department over the past year? <Col N="718"/>Why was it not aware of what appear to be serious lapses in security, as revealed by the EU committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The security is to the highest standard. Some of the airlines said that the security facilities at Dublin Airport are among the best in the world. Clearly on this particular day there were lapses on the part of Dublin Airport and the airlines. As they were identified on the day, they were corrected and further enhancements have taken place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall"><NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister suggesting that this happened by chance?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Shortall should allow the Minister to reply without interruption. The Chair has been very lenient with the Deputy who took more than the one minute allowed to make her contribution and without the Chair intervening. She should therefore allow the Minister to answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Civil Aviation Security Committee was constituted in 1974. From people in my Department I know this issue is taken extraordinarily seriously and regular checks take place. There were failures on that day but they were not catastrophic. There were specific issues tested that were not up to standard. I would not defend that and my views have been made well known. The security staff were disappointed in their performance and have looked to correct those issues. Security is an issue in all airports. The Dublin Airport Authority has been asked to manage the entire security operation to the best convenience of passengers. There is substantial recruitment of staff, 40 new people are already working there and extra X-ray areas and machines will facilitate greater efficiency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have great admiration for the way the authorities have responded to the lapse that was detected. I am sure many passengers do not feel the same when they are delayed. Additional channels and training have been put in place as quickly as possible. Is congestion and a lack of infrastructure not largely the cause of this lapse? The visible manifestations of this are queuing, under-provision and a lack of infrastructure in the provision of every service at the airport. That affects service providers as well as passengers. How can the Taoiseach be of the view that there is no congestion at Dublin Airport and that capacity poses no problem until 2009? He says he was told by the Dublin Airport Authority that this was the case. Is that in line with the Minister&rsquo;s beliefs?</P>
        <P>My understanding is that when people use Dublin Airport as a stopover, they must come out and go through security again. That is not the practice in most airports. Does that add to <Col N="719"/>queues? Is there potential in that for reducing queuing time for people coming through the airport?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt about it. All those factors contribute to the issues at Dublin Airport. Deputy Mitchell, and Deputy Shortall earlier, enunciated what people reporting on these issues do not understand. There are two capacity problems emerging at Dublin Airport. We have not passed them by because clearly they exist. One is airside for airline capacity, and that compounds the internal dynamics of capacity within the airport. The other, which I would not have thought about it this way until someone pointed it out to me but it is interesting, is that the space in Dublin Airport from landside to airside is very narrow. There is a great deal of activity in a small area. I agree with the Taoiseach and the figures indicate that we need extra capacity. We need extra airside capacity by 2007. That is on the record.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is needed this summer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We need the terminal capacity by 2009 or 2010. Not only will that have an impact on a new terminal or the new pier D and contact stands that will be created, it will allow us to reconfigure the operation into a much more cohesive one. Deputy Mitchell raised an important point regarding transiting through Dublin Airport. It will have to be made easier for passengers to transit and this is linked to the creation of a hub. There would have to be good transit facilities for passenger if it were to work. That would be much more achievable in the sort of configurations that are now being explored.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanCroweSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to hear the delay has been reduced to 15 to 25 minutes. I was there on May Day weekend and it took me an hour to get through. Has the Minister visited the airport to examine the situation? One of the new security measures suggested is that people take their shoes off. Is there not a health and safety issue in regard to people taking their shoes off? Thousands of people go through the airport, some of whom have verruca and so on. Part of the problem has to do with hand luggage. Why is there not a separate line for those who do not have hand luggage? Is the Minister concerned at the delays? While reduced somewhat, there are still unacceptable delays. There appears to be utter confusion with people trying to board planes and tourists panic-stricken in case they miss their flights. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. My suggestions are sensible and perhaps the Minister will consider them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has picked up on an issue that colleagues have raised with me during <Col N="720"/>the past week, that is, that there should be at least one access point in the security system for those with no hand luggage. We agree with the Deputy on that point. I do not regard a ten or 15 minute wait as excessive. All Members have had the experience of travelling through airports throughout the world. I have queued at many airports for 40 or 50 minutes. That is the way it is. Certainly heightened security post-11 September 2001 has impacted greatly on ease of access and travel. The matter of shoes is an issue, given the way in which items can be concealed in them and they have to be checked. In regard to health and safety issues, I would expect all those involved are aware of their obligation.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Will the Minister accept that it is not credible to suggest that by chance on the one day when the EU committee happened to be in Dublin airport there was a coincidental lapse in security? Does the Minister accept that the EU committee has shown up a system&rsquo;s failure at Dublin airport? Will he explain why the committee under the aegis of his Department which has explicit responsibility for monitoring security at the airports did not manage to uncover this system&rsquo;s failure and what action he will take in respect of that committee? Surely he will not leave those same people, who failed to detect this problem, in place on that committee? Has he moved to replace the committee?</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be more balanced with regard to the issue on the day. By and large the security system was excellent. A few issues were pointed out. From my reading of the issue, the more serious failures were with the airlines, not within the airport. I say that without fear or favour. There are specific areas in aeroplanes that must be checked every time. Objects were placed in those areas that had to be checked but they were not checked. That is extremely serious. The response from the airlines and the authority has been excellent. I understand from the security personnel involved that regular checks are carried out throughout the airport and to my knowledge nothing untoward has gone wrong. On the particular day in question there was not a huge number of lapses. There were a couple of areas where the system did not work and that was rightly pointed out. I welcome unannounced security checks at Dublin airport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the adjournment. We have suffered heavily from the failure of successive Governments to ensure balanced regional development through a failure to invest adequately in infrastructure in the west. Four years have elapsed under the national plan and in the meantime &euro;22.8 billion has been spent in the south and east regions and &euro;8.3 billion in the BMW region. The south and east regions spend represents 92% of what was forecast in the national development plan but the BMW region has achieved only 75% of the projected spend.</P>
        <P>The west and north-western part of County Mayo is in serious decline. It is the most socio-economically deprived area of Ireland. Half of Mayo graduates have to go to Dublin for their first job. If the present rate of decline continues north and west Mayo, in a line west of Killala to Newport, will be completely deserted by the end of the century. After generations of party politics in Mayo we do not have the roads, rail, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure needed to make it a competitive area.</P>
        <P>If broken promises were infrastructure, we would have all the assets we need to compete with any region of the world. That is why the western rail corridor is so important for Mayo. It is the most important piece of unused infrastructure along the entire west region, a wonderful catalyst for the development of the west. It would open up the entire area from Knock Airport to Shannon Airport right through to Rosslare. This route which closed in 1976 runs from Sligo to Limerick via Galway and Ennis, and passes through Claremorris, Tuam and Athenry. The cost of the Ennis to Claremorris line has been estimated at approximately &euro;170 million, while &euro;365 million would reopen the entire link.</P>
        <P>Opening the line from Claremorris, County Mayo, would provide a commuter service to Galway city. Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann estimates that it would take two years to reopen the first section of the line. Once again we are hoping and waiting. We await news, possibly tomorrow, about the future of the western rail corridor. The fear is that Government will be true to form and may well announce opening the southern end of the line but will neglect the western part, Ennis to Sligo, which unfortunately would be par for the course so far as successive Governments are concerned regarding the west.</P>
        <P>We need the reopening of the western rail corridor to give us essential railway infrastructure. When one considers the cost of a mile of the Luas route, the western rail corridor makes great economic sense. It would give balanced regional <Col N="723"/>development which helps the congested east coast. It would link in nicely with Knock Airport which needs its &euro;30 million investment to have proper facilities and be competitive and to take some of Dublin&rsquo;s 17 million projected passengers. It would help kick-start the Mayo link which would further open up the county. I hope there will be an announcement soon and that Mayo and its neighbouring counties will not be put on the backburner as usual. This is a plea to put the money up front for the western rail corridor to ensure Mayo will not be the last of the Mohicans as usual but the first to get funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this issue. Deputies will recall that in June 2004 the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, set up the western rail corridor working group under the chairmanship of Mr. Pat McCann, chief executive, Jurys Doyle Hotel Group.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the working group was primarily intended to provide a forum where those individuals and organisations who had long been promoting the idea of the western rail corridor could put their arguments directly to the chairman and debate the issues with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, CIE, the Department of Transport and all the other interested parties.</P>
        <P>Within the past 48 hours I have received from Mr. McCann the report of the chairman of the working group. I thank him and the other members of the group for their work on this process. In the time available I have not had the opportunity to study the report in detail, but it is clear that Mr. McCann has a positive disposition towards the restoration of the western rail corridor; a position that I have always maintained.</P>
        <P>The arrival of the report this week is timely as it affords me the opportunity to consider its proposals in the context of the preparation of the multi-annual capital investment framework for transport currently under way within my Department. I have already asked my departmental officials to urgently examine Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report to ensure that it is fully appraised in advance of the finalisation of the framework. It is in that process that decisions will be made on the future of the western rail corridor.</P>
        <P>The Deputy refers to the western rail corridor in the context of balanced regional development and I am in agreement with him. The concept of balanced regional development is integral to the core objectives of the national spatial strategy and this Government is fully committed to achieving such development in the west through record capital investment in all sectors but primarily the transport sector. This is particularly the case with regard to investment in public transport infrastructure and services.</P>
        <P>Some of the more significant rail projects carried out in the west in recent times or planned for <Col N="724"/>the near future are as follows: the rail infrastructure improvements carried out under the Rail Safety Programme 2000-2004 have upgraded all key rail lines into the west to continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers; a new rail safety programme is currently being rolled out which will include improvements to level crossings, bridges and other track work on all lines; the rail re-signalling project, known as the mini CTC, on the Dublin-Galway line was completed in June 2003 with the immediate effect of significant journey time reductions on services; the Sligo line is on target for completion of its re-signalling project later this year and similar time savings will benefit users of that line; re-signalling work on the Westport and Ballina lines will begin in early 2006 with a completion date of 2007; because of the infrastructure upgrading, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is now in a position to concentrate on introducing better timetabling and more frequent services with new improved rolling stock; with the arrival this year of new rolling stock to replace old stock and to expand the fleet, rail passengers in the west can expect to see additional improvements in services; this year Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann expects to take delivery of 36 DMU railcars and most of these are due to be allocated to the Sligo route to replace life-expired rolling stock and to increase frequency and capacity; an order for a fleet of 120 new intercity railcars has been placed by Iarnr&oacute;d&Eacute;ireann. These will enter service from 2007 onwards and will operate on the Galway, Westport and Ballina routes. At that point Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will be able to provide two-hourly services on the Galway line and increased frequencies on the Westport and Ballina lines.</P>
        <P>All these investments testify to this Government&rsquo;s commitment to balanced regional development in the west and to delivering the infrastructure that will make such development a reality.</P>
        <P>Mr. McCann&rsquo; s report will be examined in the context of the Government&rsquo;s record on delivering balanced regional development in the west and as part of the process of finalising the multi-annual investment framework for transport. It is in that process that decisions will be made on the future of the western rail corridor.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
        <P>This week, while speaking to constituents in the Portobello area, I was informed about the spraying of racist graffiti on Jewish sites in the area. I took note of the complaint and I hoped to investigate the matter further but yesterday while walking through the same area I was astonished to see graffiti on a house in Bloomfield Avenue, which had been the subject of a previous incident. I was informed the attack had occurred the night <Col N="725"/>previously at approximately 3.30 a.m.and that a number of Jewish landmarks in the Portobello area and beyond had been targeted. Among them was the Jewish Museum on Walworth Road. In most instances a swastika had been sprayed on the wall and sometimes if the culprit had time, an SS sign was added for good measure. We all know that graffiti is unsightly and costs a fair amount of money to remove, but this vandalism has much more sinister undertones. This is naked racism, anti-Semitism and even neo-Nazism raising its head. It simply cannot be tolerated in a civilised and democratic society.</P>
        <P>The Garda and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in whose constituency this took place must take these incidents seriously. I understand this is the third such incident in a short period. It was well planned and calmly executed, probably to coincide with VE day and the liberation of the concentration camps in Nazi Germany. Only recently we heard the moving testimonies of members of the Irish Jewish community who had suffered in the concentration and death camps. Their message for a future generation was clear, we cannot afford to forget the Holocaust or its victims because unless we are vigilant, history could at some time repeat itself. Clearly there is still a small number of deviant individuals who support the racial policies of the Third Reich and it is they, I believe, who were responsible for this anti-Semitic graffiti.</P>
        <P>There has been some suggestion that Muslim extremists could have been responsible. However, I do not believe this to be the case. I have spoken to members of the Muslim community and they not only condemn such action but see it as entirely counter-productive to their own cause in Palestine.</P>
        <P>My constituents wish to see an end to these incidents. The Portobello area is a beautiful part of Dublin consisting of terraced houses, which used to be a Jewish neighbourhood many years ago. It retains many Jewish landmarks and this gives the area its distinctive appeal. Some people have informed me that neo-Nazi stickers have appeared in the Camden Street area and white supremacist leaflets were also distributed. The rise of racist groups, even if they are a small minority of people, should be a matter of concern for all of us. The Ireland we all grew up in has changed enormously. Ireland and particularly the area around Portobello and the South Circular Road has become multicultural. These immigrants have contributed enormously to our economy and they add to the variety and vibrancy of the locality. The majority of Irish people have welcomed them. It is up to the political leaders to ensure that political racism does not raise its ugly head and gain a foothold in any community. It should be nipped in the bud, as quickly as possible. I am calling on the Minister today to ensure that priority is given to these incidents and that they are not simply ignored as minor incidents <Col N="726"/>and that the perpetrators are brought to justice very quickly.</P>
        <P>There is adequate legislation to pursue them and if there is not, I ask the Minister to inform the House of any loopholes in the legislation. These people are guilty of incitement to hatred as well as defacing property. History tells us that the Nazis moved from <i>Kristallnacht </i>to Aryan purity laws to the Holocaust in a short space of time. There can be no complacency about this matter. To ignore these incidents is to ignore the Jewish victims of Nazi terror.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am deputising this evening for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is unable to be present due to other commitments.</P>
        <P>The Minister has condemned in the strongest possible terms the disgusting and cowardly vandalism and daubing of Jewish landmarks in south-east Dublin in the past 48 hours. He has sought and received assurances from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this disgraceful and anti-Semitic activity will be fully investigated and that the perpetrators, if detected, will be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.</P>
        <P>The Minister has spearheaded the Government&rsquo;s drive to combat anti-Semitism by means of the Holocaust memorial day, an event funded by his Department and in which he plays a public role each year. Dublin&rsquo;s Jewish community will receive every protection against this kind of behaviour and the Garda will protect its landmarks as appropriate.</P>
        <P>On 10-11 May 2005, the Jewish Museum on Walworth Road, Dublin 8, was vandalised. The Garda at Kevin Street station have commenced an investigation and all resources required by the investigating officers to identify and apprehend the culprits responsible are being made available. Previous similar type incidents of vandalism at the same location have occurred during the past six months and are the subject of ongoing investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All patrolling garda&iacute; from Kevin Street station are devoting extra attention to the area with a view to bringing about a cessation of these acts of vandalism.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The manifestations of such a mentality must be dealt with in legislation.</P>
        <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 created an offence of publishing or distributing material or using words or behaviour that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or are likely to stir up hatred. I understand the Act is working well. &ldquo;Hatred&rdquo; is defined as hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Travelling community or sexual orientation. Public incitement to racial hatred is <Col N="727"/>a criminal offence under sections 2 and 3 of the Act in terms of material, written or oral, which is threatening, abusive or insulting.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities, conscious of the importance of the recording and monitoring of incidents that are motivated by anti-Semitism, racism, sectarianism, homophobia and xenophobia have, since October 2002, through the Garda PULSE computer system, put in place a mechanism to record and gather information on racist incidents and offenders nationwide. Furthermore, the Garda racial and intercultural office, which was established in 2001, co-ordinates, monitors and advises on all aspects of policing in the area of ethnic and cultural diversity. Personnel in that office monitor all incidents to ensure the PULSE system accurately records all such offences. Where such incidents occur, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ensures that an investigation is pursued with reference mainly to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 and the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989, these being the main relevant legislative instruments pertaining to crime of this type.</P>
        <P>More generally, and underpinning the Government&rsquo;s commitment to accommodate and respect cultural diversity in Ireland, the Government published its national action plan against racism in January. The overall aim of the plan is to provide strategic direction to combat racism and to develop a more inclusive, intercultural society in Ireland based on commitment to inclusion by design, not as an add-on or an afterthought, and based on policies that promote interaction, equality of opportunity, understanding and respect. The steering group monitoring the implementation of the action plan is looking at protection issues, protection being one of the five pillars of the plan. The first meeting of the group takes place next week and I am sure it will consider these sinister developments in light of its ongoing work.</P>
        <P>One of the key objectives of the plan is to provide effective protection and redress against racism, including a focus on discrimination, threatening behaviour and incitement to hatred. Clearly the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a very important role in this and it has done considerable work, including the establishment of the Garda racial and intercultural office, the appointment of 145 ethnic liaison garda&iacute; and the development of training methods for policing a more diverse society.</P>
        <P>The local community and ethnic liaison officer for the Portobello area is attached to Kevin Street Garda station. He is assisted by the dedicated officer for the St. Kevin&rsquo;s neighbourhood watch area, which was established in 1987. The duties of this dedicated officer include attendance at monthly meetings with members of the neighbourhood watch scheme. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that all patrolling garda&iacute; in the area are devoting extra special <Col N="728"/>attention to the area concerned with a view to bringing about a cessation of these incidents of vandalism. We all wish the Garda success in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will not tolerate attacks on members of minorities in our society, and the same is true for all Members of this House, including me. Our society has no place for people who carry out this type of crime. Graffiti writers, when apprehended, are arrested and charged under the Criminal Damage Act 1991.</P>

      <sTitle>Irish Prison Service.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the motion on the Adjournment raised by Deputy Gormley, with which I entirely agree. Three weeks ago in the Kevin Street area, an attack occurred on a young gay man who is still in a coma and subsequent attacks on members of the gay community have occurred within that jurisdiction. It is possible that a particular group is involved in racism and attacks on the gay community. It would be worthwhile for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to investigate the matter.</P>
        <P>The crisis in the prison system is out of control and I cannot remember when we last had such a crisis. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was appointed three years ago, which is the same length of time that we have had an industrial dispute concerning overtime for prison officers. Only two weeks ago the prison officers voted by two to one to reject the offer that was made, largely because of the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his megaphone diplomacy, but also because the offer made was very inflexible, which could have been remedied if it had been presented in a proper fashion.</P>
        <P>For the past three years the Minister has been trying to save &euro;60 million. In that time he has created mayhem and chaos, and the Irish Prison Service is out of control as a result of his action. He has closed down three prisons, Fort Mitchel in Spike Island, the Curragh Prison and Shanganagh Castle. They have all been lying idle in mothballs for 18 months, with 300 to 400 prison spaces, which otherwise could have been used. At the same time the Minister has paid ten times the market value for land in north County Dublin for a proposed prison to replace Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>In the meantime in his reports of this year and last year the inspector of prisons slated the quality of the prison system. He described the appalling conditions that operate in Irish prisons to the extent that he has called for the closure not only of Mountjoy, but also of Limerick and Cork prisons. The overcrowding in Cork Prison is such that it contains double the number of prisoners that it should. Every prison is overcrowded because of the Minister&rsquo;s policy of closing down prisons. He now proposes going a step further to punish prison officers for rejecting his inflexible offer and his megaphone diplomacy by privatising <Col N="729"/>the prison escort service, as proposed in a Bill just published. This is outrageous behaviour. He now proposes to close down two more prisons, Shelton Abbey and Loughan House, and turn them into private institutions requiring more people to be recruited and paid.</P>
        <P>The Minister is presiding over a Prison Service that is out of control. His ego has decided that city hall will not be defeated, which is his attitude to prison staff. This represents a red rag to a bull. Instead of engaging in diplomacy in industrial relations he is using confrontation. The Minister should get a grip of himself and recognise that he is more than half way through his term in office. Throughout those three years we have had a crisis in the prison service. We again have a revolving door system, with prisoners being released early because of lack of places for them. Prison services such as education cannot proceed because of doubling up in most cells. This means that we have a worse prison service than we had in the last century, which is reflected in the recently published report of the inspector of prisons, Dermot Kinlen.</P>
        <P>While I hope I will not need to raise this issue again, I fear I will need to do so. I would not be surprised if by the time the Government reaches the end of its term of office, in addition to the three prisons the Minister has already closed down and the two he is about to close, one or two more are closed down. He frequently claims to be doing wonderful things to modernise the Prison Service when in reality he is putting it back to the Stone Age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and I will ask my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to take on board his concern regarding attacks on members of the gay community and pursue the matter with his officials.</P>
        <P>The Deputy referred to a three-year crisis in the prison system. There has been no three-year crisis in the Prison Service. Indeed, since taking office, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has overseen significant positive developments in it. New prison accommodation has been completed in Limerick and work is under way at Portlaoise. Despite Deputy Costello&rsquo;s objection, the Minister is going ahead with his project to replace Mountjoy Prison with a new and modern prison complex in north County Dublin. Deputy Costello&rsquo;s preference to have the current Mountjoy Prison refurbished would cost in the region of &euro;418 million.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>A site for a new prison campus to replace the Mountjoy complex has been purchased. Deputy McDowell is also planning to <Col N="730"/>build a new southern prison at Spike Island to replace the antiquated Cork Prison. Furthermore, work is under way to complete the introduction of humane special observation cells in all prisons, doing away with the former practice of distressed prisoners being kept in padded cells. The Minister will publish new prison rules in the coming weeks which will allow for mandatory drug testing and the enforcement of drug-free prisons.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, there is no question of the Minister having any personal dispute with prison officers. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, and I have the height of admiration and respect for the dedication and commitment of prison officers in the delivery of their very challenging duties. It has long been recognised that the huge levels of expenditure on overtime in prisons are not sustainable and must be reduced. Unfortunately, when the Labour Party was last in government, it did absolutely nothing to tackle this problem, which diverts much-needed funds from important projects such as prisoner rehabilitation programmes and an accelerated prisons building programme.</P>
        <P>Since the Minister took office in 2002, he has allowed ample space and time for a mutually acceptable negotiated settlement to be reached between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association. Following the rejection of the earlier offer in October 2003, he agreed to use the full range of industrial relations machinery available in the State, including the conciliation services of the Labour Relations Commission and the ultimate arbitration facilities of the Civil Service Arbitration Board. That process continued over a 16-month period and involved long and difficult negotiations, leading to a substantial arbitration award recommendation. The deal included an 8% pensionable arbitration allowance and the payment of a lump sum of &euro;13,750.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, the members of the Prison Officers Association did not follow the recommendation of their own executive and decided to reject the proposal for organisational change in the Prison Service. It must be clearly understood that no Minister can be in the business of renegotiating a proposal for organisational change which has already been arbitrated upon by the Civil Service Arbitration Board &mdash; perhaps Deputy Costello thinks that he should.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

	<P>I gather that he would not do so either. Anyone who believes that there is another forum beyond the Civil Service Arbitration Board where something extra may be gained is not living in the real world. We cannot compromise the integrity of the whole industrial relations process, which has served us so well and must <Col N="731"/>continue to serve our public services in future. As the Deputy knows, the arbitration process is the end of the line.</P>
        <P>The Minister has never made a secret of the consequences of failure to reach an agreement, and he was left with no option but to proceed immediately with the agenda approved by the Government to ensure that the Prison Service is run as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible. That agenda is now in place and steps to implement it are under way.</P>

	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to an incident which took place on 6 April 2005.</P>
        <P>The Interim Railway Safety Commission has already been in contact with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann about this incident and will monitor closely the company&rsquo;s internal inquiry.</P>
        <P>If this monitoring reveals issues of importance to railway safety, the Interim Railway Safety Commission will take appropriate action.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, pending the outcome of its internal inquiries, I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has taken the railcar sets in question out of service and has locked the doors between similar railcar sets. This will prevent any accidental falls from a divided train and ensure that passenger safety is assured in the unlikely event of a further such train divide.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20, 51 and 139 to 142, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I have already dealt in detail with the position in regard to the provision of additional terminal capacity at Dublin Airport in my earlier reply today to Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 4.</P><Col N="735"/>
        
        <P>With regard to Aer Lingus, as one of the main customers of Dublin Airport, Aer Lingus operational requirements will have to be taken into account by whoever owns and manages the new terminal.</P>
        <P>I am very anxious, in the interests of the airline and the Irish economy generally, to achieve clarity on the future of Aer Lingus as soon as possible. Aer Lingus must be provided with the flexibility to grow and compete on a level playing field. To fund growth and to provide financial security, Aer Lingus must have access to the full range of funding mechanisms and equity capital is a crucial element in that mix.</P>
        <P>In that context, the Government will be making a decision shortly on the necessary arrangements to be put in place to facilitate investment in Aer Lingus.</P>
        <P>On the matter of providing rapid rail transport services to Dublin Airport, the programme for Government contains a specific commitment to develop a metro for Dublin with a link to Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department a detailed business case for a metro from the city centre to Dublin Airport while Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted proposals <Col N="736"/>last July for an integrated rail network in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>In the light of the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of agreement in principle to a ten year capital investment envelope for transport, work is under way in my Department on a ten year transport investment framework.</P>
        <P>An outline of the investment framework is currently under consideration by a Cabinet committee. I will bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet committee has concluded its work.</P>

        <P>My Department is currently funding a programme of further rolling stock expansion involving the purchase of: 36 diesel multiple units, DMUs, which will come into service in late 2005-early 2006 and will increase the passenger carrying capacity on the Dublin outer suburban system and the Dublin to Sligo line; 80 diesel railcars, which are already in service and are being used on the Dublin outer suburban system; 36 DART carriages, which are already in service and which have brought the DART fleet up to a total of 156 units or just short of double the initial fleet of 80; 67 intercity carriages to be used on the Dublin to Cork route and which will be in service by mid-2006; and 120 regional railcars which will be used on the Dublin to Ballina, Westport, Galway, Limerick, Tralee and Waterford lines. The addition of these new units will see the removal from service of all older rolling stock and the provision of clock face timetabling on all intercity routes. These units are due to be delivered in 2007. Funding of some &euro;55 million has been allocated from my Department&rsquo;s 2005 Estimate for rolling stock.</P>
        <P>There are no specific allocations before my Department at present for rolling stock acquisition.

	<P>The report by consultants Farrell Grant Sparks, FGS, concerned the organisational structure for the proposed driver testing and standards authority. The report will assist in the process of setting up the authority as the establishment of the authority will require detailed consultation and negotiations with staff representatives and the report&rsquo;s recommendations are an important input into this process.</P>
        <P>A significant recommendation of the report is that additional functions in the general area of road safety should be assigned to the authority. I have indicated during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Driver Testing and Standards <Col N="737"/>Authority Bill 2004 that it is my intention to amend the Bill on Committee Stage to provide for the assignment of additional functions to the authority. A copy of the FGS report will be available on my Department&rsquo;s website shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 41 together.</P>
        <P>The working group to examine the proposal to reopen the western rail corridor was established by my predecessor, Deputy S&eacute;amus Brennan, in June last year. The chairman of the group, Mr. Pat McCann, chief executive of Jurys Doyle Hotel Group, submitted a report to me within the last 48 hours.</P>
        <P>In the time available I have not had the opportunity to study the report in detail yet but it is clear that Mr. McCann has a positive disposition towards the restoration of the western rail corridor; a position that I have always maintained. I should clarify, however, that this is not a feasibility study; it is a report written by Mr. McCann based on the deliberations of the working group. I have no knowledge of or views on media leaks in relation to this subject.</P>
        <P>The arrival of the report this week is very timely as it affords me the opportunity to consider its proposals in the context of the preparation of the multi-annual capital investment framework for transport currently under way within my Department.</P>
        <P>I have asked my officials to urgently examine Mr. McCann&rsquo;s report to ensure that it is fully appraised in advance of the finalisation of the framework. It is in that process that decisions will be made in relation to the future of the western rail corridor.</P>

        <P>The transport investment framework will build on the work already completed under the transport element of the NDP. It will also take account of the work already done on investment priorities under the current capital envelope to end 2009 and of the various strategic studies already completed by my Department and its agencies, including A Platform for Change, the Strategic Rail Review and the National Road Needs Study. More specifically, my Department has engaged with C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, the Railway Procurement Agency, the National Roads Authority and the Dublin Transportation Office in order to identify the broad direction and priorities under the investment framework.</P>
        <P>It is a fundamental requirement that in so doing we propose an integrated solution to the transport challenges facing us and not merely a sectoral response.</P>
        <P>An outline of the draft investment framework is currently under active consideration by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs. I intend to bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet committee has concluded its work and I have fully considered the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the implications of the strategic environmental assessment directive.</P>
        <P>It is not possible to outline the specifics of the draft framework pending the completion of its consideration by the Cabinet committee and a decision by the Government. However, the broad direction is expected to be along the following lines: completion of the major inter-urban motorways by 2010 and the upgrading of the rest of the national road network over the period of the framework; transformation of the transport system in the greater Dublin area, with a particular focus on the public transport network; completion of the renewal of the national rail network, with a major focus on the provision of enhanced services; upgrading of the public transport services in provincial cities and in the regions; addressing the management of the demand for transport; ensuring the accessibility of the public transport system to people with dis<Col N="739"/>abilities; and mainstreaming the rural transport initiative into the transport investment programme.</P>

	<P>The Dublin Transportation Office&rsquo;s A Platform for Change provides the transport-planning framework for the development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area up to 2016 and is being used by my Department to guide investment decisions under the current five year capital envelope and the preparation of a ten year transport investment framework.</P>
        <P>Major increases in the capacity of the public transport system are being delivered: (1) DART capacity has almost doubled since 2000; (2) 80 new diesel railcars were introduced earlier this year on suburban commuter services and a further 36 are to be delivered next year; (3) the peak capacity of Dublin Bus has increased by over 25%; (4) Bus &Eacute;ireann has increased its services by around 40% from commuter towns, such as Drogheda, Navan and Naas, to the city centre; (5) to facilitate buses, my Department is funding a major programme to expand the quality bus corridor network and improve traffic management in the greater Dublin Area; and (6) the Luas is now in operation on the Sandyford green line and on the Tallaght red line and on schedule to carry 20 million passengers in its first full year of operation. Work is continuing on the DART upgrade project, phase 2 of which will deliver a further increase in capacity. Planning of the Kildare route project is also continuing, with a railway order application expected later this year. The completion of the M50, the port tunnel and the M50 upgrade will provide substantial additions to the city&rsquo;s strategic road network.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Transportation Office also co-operates closely with the planning authorities to influence land use policies and planning decisions to favour more sustainable forms of transport at the planning stage. This is being achieved through integrated land use and transportation plans at local level and an input on major planning applications and appeals which are of strategic transport importance. All of this is being done with the spatial planning context provided by the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines.</P>
        <P>My Department is working on a ten year transport investment plan which will set the frame<Col N="740"/>work for further major capital expenditure on the capital&rsquo;s transport system. The Dublin Transportation Office is also working on a demand management strategy for the greater Dublin area, which is an essential complement to the investment programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Significant investment has been made to date under the national development plan in acquiring new buses for Dublin Bus. As a consequence, the capacity of the fleet has been increased by nearly 25% and the company is now carrying approximately 150 million passengers per annum. Approximately 400 buses have been purchased by Dublin Bus since 1999 with the assistance of Exchequer and EU funds.</P>
        <P>Funding under the national development plan involves a combination of Exchequer, EU and CIE&rsquo;s own resources in delivering on the objectives contained in the plan.</P>
        <P>I understand the company intends to purchase 70 new buses in 2005. The Exchequer is providing a sum of &euro;1.2 million in part funding of these buses.</P>
        <P>In addition to the significant Exchequer investment in Dublin Bus in recent years, there has also been significant investment made to date under the NDP in other modes such as Luas, suburban rail lines and the DART. In light of the significant expansion of rail capacity and considering demographic changes in the city, the management of Dublin Bus is examining whether capacity on certain corridors might be better utilised to meet growing demand elsewhere. I am awaiting the outcome of this review. I do, however, foresee an expansion in the bus market in the greater Dublin area in the coming years, involving participation by Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and private operators. In this regard, my Department is currently in discussions with the parties concerned on the appropriate framework to give effect to such expansion.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The aim of EuroRAP is to improve road safety by assessing risks and identifying shortcomings on national road networks across Europe that can be addressed with practical road improvement measures. This is a commendable goal and I therefore welcome the publication of their recent report on the state of Ireland&rsquo;s major national roads. I note that the NRA made a very substantial contribution to the preparation of this report.</P>
        <P>The EuroRAP report found that the safety performance of the Irish major road network is broadly the same as other countries that they have studied, namely, the Netherlands, Britain and Sweden. The average fatal collision rate on Ireland&rsquo;s motorways shows that they are about as safe as those in Britain. The British rate is only slightly higher than in Sweden and the Netherlands but all are lower than the rate in Spain.</P>
        <P>In general the safest types of roads are typically motorways but, because there are currently relatively fewer miles of motorway in Ireland than other countries, there are fewer sections of the safest category &mdash; low risk &mdash; road in Ireland than in the other countries studied. However, this will change with the substantial investment we are making in improving our national road network over the next few years &mdash; over &euro;8 billion will be spent on the network over the period 2005-09. I expect there to be a very significant road safety dividend associated with this increased investment.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, the NRA is already working on addressing many of the specific deficiencies identified by the EuroRAP report. This year alone almost &euro;54 million will be spent by the NRA on road maintenance and &euro;40 million will be spent on a range of road safety measures.</P>
        <P>However, I must emphasise that behavioural issues and not road conditions continue to be the single biggest contributory factor to road collisions. Analysis of factors contributing to fatal and injury accidents in 2002 indicate that driver behaviour, 86%, and pedestrian behaviour,<?oasys _jy?>9.7%, are the key contributory factors, whereas road factors were identified as contributory factors in only 2.5% of fatal and serious accident collisions.</P>

	<P>Ministerial approval in respect of payments to former Aer Rianta board members related to certain cases involving the premature termination of their terms of office. It was agreed by my predecessor that three board members who had not completed their terms of office as envisaged at <Col N="742"/>the time of their original appointment should be paid the balance of their directors&rsquo; fees which would otherwise have been payable to them had they completed their terms of office.</P>
        <P>Aside from that specific arrangement, the approval of my predecessor was not sought or given for the severance terms of the outgoing acting chief executive which, I understand, were in the context of her contract as deputy chief executive. Nor was my predecessor&rsquo;s approval sought for the severance terms of the other members or executives of the former Aer Rianta board prior to its replacement by the Dublin Airport Authority on 1 October last year.</P>
        <P>I understand from the Dublin Airport Authority that all directors on the new board of that authority have been fully briefed on the relevant provisions of the guidelines for State bodies, companies and ethics legislation and made fully aware of the business code of ethics.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 73 and 131 together.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to develop a metro for Dublin with a link to Dublin Airport.</P>
        <P>The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department a detailed business case for a metro from the city centre to Dublin Airport while Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann submitted proposals last July for an integrated rail network in the greater Dublin area, including the interconnector project.</P>
        <P>In the light of the announcement by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement of agreement in principle to a ten year capital investment envelope for transport, work is under way in my Department on a ten year transport investment framework.</P>
        <P>An outline of the draft investment framework is currently under active consideration by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs. I intend to bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet committee has concluded its work and I have fully considered the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the implications of the strategic environmental assessment directive.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that the metro and the interconnector serve different functions. The purpose of the metro is to provide high capacity public transport in areas of the city not currently served by rail. The purpose of the interconnector is to better interconnect the existing Dublin suburban rail network, relieve a bottleneck in the city centre and increase the capacity of that network.</P>
        <P>The projected cost of the metro has been the subject of a detailed analysis by the RPA. However, the actual cost will ultimately be determined through a competitive tendering process. I am anxious to ensure that all transport projects deliver value for money for the State, but I also consider it prudent at this early stage in the development of the metro project that we evaluate it on the basis of conservative cost assumptions.</P>

	<P>I welcome the recently announced Aer Lingus results for 2004 which show a solid financial performance for the year at the operational level with an operating profit of &euro;96.3 million. The provision of &euro;102.5 million for restructuring costs gives a net profit of &euro;1.2 million for the year.</P><Col N="745"/>
        
        <P>Significant developments during the year include further reductions in costs, the introduction of a new low fares strategy, the launch of the Fast Pass check-in facility at Dublin Airport and the dramatic increase in the use of the web for bookings. The board, management and staff are to be commended for this continued turnaround in the ongoing challenging environment in aviation.</P>
        <P>Looking to the future, the competitive and changing nature of the aviation industry and the ongoing market pressures require a continuing focus by the company on cost reductions and efficiency improvements in order to sustain a profitable and viable operation which can take advantage of growth opportunities.</P>
        <P>Unless the focus on efficiencies and competitiveness continues unabated, the airline will continue to be vulnerable to market forces and to unexpected economic and other external shocks. Furthermore, it will not have the necessary cost base to support a growth strategy. It is, therefore, vital that the cost cutting measures and new work practice changes in the company&rsquo;s existing business plan are delivered.</P>
        <P>The second key essential for the future success of Aer Lingus is that it must be provided with the flexibility to grow and compete on a level playing field. The current situation in relation to access to capital is not sustainable and, if continued, will seriously restrict the airline, particularly in relation to profitable growth opportunities on long-haul routes. To fund that growth and to provide financial security, the airline must have access to the full range of funding mechanisms and equity capital is a crucial element in that mix.</P>
        <P>In that context, the Government will be making a decision shortly on the necessary arrangements to be put in place to facilitate an investment transaction.</P>
        <P>Once the Government makes its decision in the matter, consultations with all the stakeholders will take place in relation to options for a transaction and in relation to essential preparatory work.</P>
        <P>In relation to the new chief executive designate, I have been advised by Aer Lingus that Dermot Mannion will be taking up the position at the airline in August 2005.</P>

        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted a business case to my Department for the development of a greater Dublin integrated rail network aimed at meeting the projected demand for rail services into the future. Included in the business case are proposals to: construct a new rail station in the city centre; provide an interconnector tunnel linking Heuston to the docklands; provide a spur off the Maynooth line to the N3 beyond Dunboyne; and expand the capacity of the DART.</P>
        <P>These proposals are being considered in the context of the multi-annual capital investment framework for transport, which is being prepared by my Department. When the framework has been approved by the Government, the implementing agencies will begin more detailed planning and analysis of the individual projects, including cost estimates and timescales.</P>
        <P>I understand that, mainly for health and environmental reasons, it is not proposed to operate diesel trains in the interconnector tunnel.</P>
        <P>As regards the DART, the signalling system in place at the present time means that the track between Connolly and Pearse Stations is limited to 12 train paths per hour. I expect to receive from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann shortly proposals to upgrade the signalling system, which will increase the maximum number of trainpaths on this section of track to 16 per hour. In the longer term, the proposed interconnector tunnel will provide a direct connection between the northern and south western lines, facilitate a substantial increase in the overall capacity of the suburban network and address the capacity constraints in the city centre.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Transport</askee>
        <Quest>the total amount paid by his Department to the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of charges due for foreign military aircraft passing through Irish airspace in respect of each of the past five years; the unit cost in respect of each such aircraft; the breakdown of the nationality of the aircraft in respect of which such charges were paid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[15581/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, provides air traffic control and communications services to aircraft which pass through Irish controlled airspace &mdash;<i>en-route</i>&mdash; and aircraft landing and taking off from Irish airports &mdash; terminal. Only a small proportion of military flights through Irish administered airspace actually pass through Irish sovereign airspace. Irish administered airspace covers 450,000 square kilometres of which 83,000 square kilometres is sovereign airspace.</P>
        <P>Under a Eurocontrol, European organisation for the safety of air navigation, multilateral agreement to which Ireland is a party, various categories of flights &mdash; flights under visual flight rules, flights performed by small aircraft, flights performed for the transport of Heads of State and search and rescue flights &mdash; are exempt from paying <i>en-route</i> charges. In the case of other categories &mdash; military flights, training flights, flights performed to test air navigation equipment and circular flights &mdash; states have the option to exempt such flights from payment of the <i>en-route</i> charge. In common with most Eurocontrol member states, Ireland exempts all such flights, including military flights of member states of Eurocontrol, United States and Canada, from payment of the <i>en-route</i> charge and this arrangement has applied since Ireland joined the Eurocontrol en-route charging scheme in the early 1970&rsquo;s. Because of this arrangement the IAA costs in relation to military flights are met from my Department&rsquo;s Vote.</P>
        <P>From information received from Eurocontrol it is understood that Austria, Finland, Switzerland and Moldova do not currently grant exempted status to US military flights. However, my Department understands that invoices issued by the above states to the US authorities in respect of military flights have not been paid.</P>
        <P>Ireland also exempts military aircraft flights from payment of the communications charge &mdash; a set amount per contact &mdash; and the IAA costs in relation to those charges are also met from my Department&rsquo;s Vote. Efforts to collect this charge in the early 1990&rsquo;s were unsuccessful and, follow<Col N="749"/>ing advice from the Attorney General, debts then outstanding were written off with the agreement of the Department of Finance and a decision taken to cease charging the communications fee to military aircraft.</P>
        <P>The total amounts, not including VAT, paid to the authority in the years 2000 to 2004 in relation to exempted flights other than flights under visual flight rules are as follows: 2000, &euro;1,139,283; 2001, &euro;1,377,560; 2002, &euro;1,642,541; 2003, &euro;2,148,374; and 2004, &euro;3,687,933.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that payments are made to the IAA in respect of exempted flights on a monthly basis in arrears and are subject to reconciliation in the following year. Therefore, the amounts paid to the IAA in any one year should <Col N="750"/>not be taken as a definitive guide to the actual number of exempted flights that took place in that year.</P>
        <P>
          <i>En-route</i> charges are dependent on various factors such as size and weight &mdash; this provides the number of service units &mdash; which is then multiplied by the unit rate. The unit rate is a rate set in respect of each member state by Eurocontrol and is related to the total costs of the IAA in providing air traffic control services as well as aviation-related costs of the Department and the Meteorological Service.</P>
        <P>The total number of <i>en-route</i> flights and total number of <i>en-route</i> service units for the years 2001 to 2004 as provided by Eurocontrol &mdash; figures are not available for 2000 &mdash; are as follows:</P><Col N="749"/>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 61 and 132 together.</P>
        <P>Since becoming Minister for Transport, my focus has been to move forward to achieve clarity on the future of Aer Lingus as soon as possible. The key driver for this is to ensure that Aer Lingus continues to make a valuable contribution to the economic and tourism development of the country.</P>
        <P>To achieve this, I believe that the airline must be provided with the flexibility to grow and compete on a level playing field. The current situation is restricting the airline, particularly in relation to profitable growth opportunities on long-haul routes. To fund that growth and to provide financial security, the airline must have access to the full range of funding mechanisms and equity capital is a crucial element in that mix.</P>
        <P>As the Deputies are aware, the Government will be making a decision shortly on the necessary arrangements to be put in place to facilitate a capital injection in Aer Lingus. Clearly, the funding needs of Aer Lingus will determine the scale, nature and timing of any investment. These matters will be considered further once the <Col N="751"/>Government has made its decision, appropriate advisers are engaged and consultations with stakeholders take place.</P>
        <P>As I have already indicated, the key driver for facilitating an equity injection in Aer Lingus is to fund growth and provide financial security. It is clear that any investment transaction involving the issuing of new shares would ensure that the proceeds would go directly to the company. However, the proceeds from the sale of any existing shares held by the State in the company would go to the Exchequer in line with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004. Decisions in relation to these matters will be made at the appropriate time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Developments at EU level will result in new heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, having to comply with higher standards in relation to the fields of vision of drivers. EU Directive 2003/97/EC, which harmonises the rules relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision on motor vehicles and of vehicles equipped with these devices, provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for an extension of the field of vision so as to address the issue of blind spots. These enhanced requirements should lead to a reduction in fatalities and serious injuries involving pedestrians and cyclists due to the driver&rsquo;s inadequate field of vision. The directive requires all new HGVs entering into service from 26 January 2007 to meet the revised standards for field of vision set in the directive. The directive was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Entry into Service) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, which were made on 20 December 2004. Subject to practical engineering constraints and the agreement of the European Commission, it is my intention to also require existing vehicles of the types covered by the directive to be retrofitted with the necessary mirrors.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I have also written to representative groups the IRHA, SIMI, etc. and met with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to encourage proactive measures be taken prior to January 2007. Also, drivers of mechanically propelled vehicles in a public place should be aware of the statutory requirements in road traffic law to drive with reasonable consideration for other persons and with due care and attention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Proposals have been made recently by the Shannon Airport Authority, Shannon Development Authority and the Mid-West Regional Authority regarding rollout of key infrastructural projects in the Shannon airport catchment area. I am aware also that it is the view of the board of the Shannon Airport Authority that there needs to be a complementary programme of this nature to underpin an independent and competitive Shannon Airport. Work under way in my Department on a ten year transport investment framework will address the future infrastructural requirements of the mid-west region. I would point out that there has been substantial investment in national roads in the Shannon region in recent years and this work is ongoing.</P>
        <P>Projects that have already been completed include the N7 Limerick parkway, the N18 Ballycasey to Dromoland phase 1, Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass, the N18-N19 Hurlers Cross, the N20 Croom bypass and the N20-N21 Adare-Limerick scheme. Construction has also commenced on the N18 Ennis bypass.</P>
        <P>In addition, the N7 Dublin-Limerick route has already been completed to motorway-dual carriageway standard as far as Portlaoise and, at the Limerick end, the N7 Limerick southern ring road, phase 1, was opened to traffic last year. The remainder of this route will be completed to motorway-high quality dual carriageway standard over the period to 2010. The N7 Limerick southern ring road, phase 2, which will incorporate a tunnel under the River Shannon, is due to start construction in 2006.</P>
        <P>These major road improvement schemes are critical components of the transport infrastructure of the Shannon region which will not only improve the accessibility of the airport but also enhance the overall attractiveness of the region for investment and job creation.</P>
        <P>As regards rail infrastructure, I met with the Shannon Rail Link Partnership on 22 March last to discuss the proposal for a rail link to Shannon and subsequent to that meeting Irish Rail brought forward draft terms of reference for a feasibility study. I expect that these terms of reference will be agreed shortly following consultations by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann with the Shannon Rail Link Partnership.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay currently comes within the scope of the on-the-spot fines system. The amount of the on-the-spot fine applicable to this offence is &euro;19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences.</P>
        <P>Where a person does not pay the on-the-spot fine and is subsequently convicted in court of the said offence, he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding &euro;800 for a first offence. The maximum fine for a second or subsequent offence is &euro;1,500 and, in the case of a third or subsequent offence committed within a 12 month period, &euro;1,500 and-or a prison sentence of up to three months.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on-the-spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system already applies to the offences of exceeding a speed limit and non-compliance with seat belt regulations. The original amount of the fixed charge will automatically increase by 50% where payment is not made within 28 days of the date of the original notice.</P>
        <P>Regulations to provide for the rollout of the fixed charge system to the majority of traffic and parking offences, including the offence of parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay, are currently being prepared by the Department of Transport in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>I indicated in the D&aacute;il during the passage of the Road Traffic Bill before Christmas that I intend that the level of fixed charge for the offence of illegally parking in a disabled persons&rsquo; parking bay will be pitched at a level that will be significantly higher than the fixed charge for other parking offences.</P>
        <P>The operation of the fixed charge system is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda. I understand that it is expected to have the new system available during the summer of 2005.</P>

	<P>I have had two meetings with representatives of NTR &mdash; on 17 February 2005 and 5 May 2005. Both meetings dealt with the issue of congestion at the Westlink bridge and the options for a speedy transition to barrier free tolling. In the course of both meetings I emphasised the critical importance of moving to barrier free tolling as quickly as possible. Following the 5 May meeting, at which NTR outlined options for moving to open road tolling at Westlink, NTR will now engage with the National Roads Authority in relation to the upgrade of that section of the M50, including the upgrade of the Westlink toll facility, operated by NTR.</P>
        <P>In addition to the foregoing, my Department has had contact with NTR in relation to the State&rsquo;s share of the Westlink toll revenues and with NTR and other toll operators in relation to legislative changes necessary to support enforcement of a barrier free toll regime.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 55 together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the development of specific proposals for the expansion of the Luas network lies with the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA. The RPA is currently advancing plans for extensions of Luas to the docklands and Cherrywood and my Department is awaiting business plans from the RPA in order to assist in its evaluation of both extensions. Business plans are not usually published.</P>
        <P>Both projects will be considered at a strategic level in the context of the multi-annual transport investment framework which I am developing. A draft of the multi-annual transport plan is currently under consideration by the Cabinet committee on infrastructure, housing and PPPs. I will bring proposals to Government in due course once the Cabinet committee has concluded its work.</P>
        <P>Under the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001, the statutory approval process for any specific extension of the Luas network is initiated by an application to me by the RPA for a railway order. I understand that such an application, in <Col N="757"/>respect of the Luas extension to Cherrywood, is likely to be submitted in the near future.</P>

        <QRef>[15587/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As a result of the full liberalisation of the European aviation market in the 1990s, there are no longer any Government or EU controls on market access in the Irish aviation market. This influences my overall approach to that market. Liberalisation of the European air transport sector has ensured that fares, routes and frequency of services operated by carriers at all airports on the island of Ireland are entirely commercial decisions for each airline, in consultation with the relevant airport authorities.</P>
        <P>The Government has a long-standing policy of assisting Derry Airport, in the interests of North-South co-operation, and in recognition of the fact that the natural catchment area of the airport includes east Donegal. The Government recently approved proposals for the allocation of capital funding for City of Derry Airport in co-operation with the British Government. A joint funding package totalling &euro;15 million was approved, in principle, in response to requests from Derry City Council.</P>
        <P>Since 2001, my Department has been supporting scheduled air services between Derry and Dublin through the PSO air service programme and tender proposals for the operation of services on the route for the next three years are currently being considered.</P>
        <P>Specifically in relation to Aer Lingus, it is this Government&rsquo;s wish that the airline continues to make a significant and valuable contribution to the economic and tourism development of the country. Everyone would agree that it can only do this if it can compete successfully, operate profitably and has access to a variety of funding sources to facilitate growth.</P>
        <P>I am very anxious, in the interests of the airline and the Irish economy, to move forward to achieve clarity on the future of Aer Lingus as soon as possible. In that context, the Government will be making a decision shortly on the necessary arrangements to be put in place to facilitate an investment transaction.</P>

	<P>I have been advised by Dublin Bus that the total number of buses in its fleet for each year since 2001 is 1,062 buses. In this period, the company has replaced mini and single deck buses with higher capacity double deck buses, thus increasing the passenger carrying capacity of its fleet by nearly 25%.</P>
        <P>I understand the company intends to purchase 70 new replacement buses in 2005. These new buses include 20 new high capacity triaxle buses which provide 20% more passenger carrying capacity than double deck buses. Exchequer funding of &euro;1.2 million is being provided towards the cost of these buses.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus is currently examining ways of maximising the utilisation of the bus fleet, in light of the significant investment made to date under the national development plan in other modes such as Luas, suburban rail and the DART upgrade, and I am awaiting the outcome of this review.</P>
        <P>I foresee an expansion in the bus market in the greater Dublin area in the coming years, involving participation by Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and private operators.

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Dublin Port tunnel project was developed by Dublin City Council, and the National Roads Authority, NRA. As a major new addition to the road infrastructure in the Dublin area, the port tunnel will provide a high quality access route for heavy goods vehicles getting to and from Dublin Port and will improve traffic flow in the city for freight distributors and other port-related traffic. The port tunnel will also have substantial environmental and safety benefits through the removal of HGVs from residential areas.</P>
        <P>I understand that arrangements are being put in place by Dublin City Council and the NRA to ensure the smooth integration of traffic from the port tunnel into the Dublin road network, particularly at the M1-M50 interchange, and to avoid congestion in the port area.</P>
        <P>I am informed that these measures together with the significant upgrade of the M50, including the move to free flow open road tolling, the opening of the south eastern motorway section of the M50 this summer, the widening of the N7 Naas Road, and the upgrade projects on the N2 and N3 will deliver important improvements to the capital&rsquo;s road network. I am confident that these major improvement works will deliver a quality road infrastructure that is safer and reduce congestion for all road users.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 146 together.</P>
        <P>Park and ride is included as an element of the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, transport strategy 2000-16, A Platform for Change. Where their use is appropriate, such facilities need to be designed and implemented in association with other measures, such as public transport improvements, traffic management and parking controls. A Dublin Transportation Office working group, consisting of representatives of the DTO itself, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, RPA and the local authorities, produced a strategy in November 2004 for the development of rail-based park and ride facilities in the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>Earlier this week, I had a detailed and very productive discussion with the chairman and chief executive of the DTO on the findings and recommendations of this strategy. I will communicate with the DTO in the next few days setting out my response to its strategy.</P>
        <P>I am acutely aware of the need to develop appropriate park and ride facilities in order to facilitate as in other major urban areas, the modal shift from car use to the use of public transport. Officials in my Department are continuing to consult the relevant authorities to ensure this matter is given adequate attention and support will be provided in appropriate cases. As tangible evidence of this policy, my Department provided financial support for a 920 space park and ride facility which opened in Cork in December 2004.</P>

	<P>There has been a press report to that effect. I have asked my Department to obtain a copy of the British agency&rsquo;s report. Motor vehicles must comply with a range of requirements while being used in a public place. These requirements are set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004 and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. Road traffic law assigns responsibility to the user of the vehicle for ensuring compliance with these regulations. Enforcement of road traffic law is a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>In accordance with EU requirements, goods vehicles and trailers are liable for a roadworthiness test when they are one year old and every year thereafter. The items to be tested as part of a vehicle test are specified in a EU directive. The roadworthiness test reflects both the requirements of the directive and those laid down in the national &ldquo;in-use&rdquo; regulations.</P>
        <P>The implementation of EU Directive 2000/30/EC which provides for random roadside roadworthiness testing of HGVs will also assist in securing adherence to vehicle standards.

	<P>As indicated in the reply to Question No. 49 of 24 March 2005, I understand that the Commission for Taxi Regulation is currently reviewing existing regulations governing safety and service standards in the industry. The outcome of this review will provide the basis for the development of a new national code for the regulation of taxis, wheelchair accessible taxis, hackneys and limousines and their drivers.</P>
        <P>It is understood from the commission that 131 submissions have been received in response to the public consultation process and these are being considered. It is further understood that the <Col N="763"/>commission aims to complete the review process by the end of May 2005 following which the preparation of the new code of regulation will commence.</P>

	<P>Automated toll collection is currently in use on existing toll plazas and provides for one toll lane in each direction dedicated to the automated collection of tolls. A physical barrier is used on the lanes to prevent non-payment of tolls. The only route where a move to full open road on barrier free tolling, that is, no manual collection and barrier free, is being considered is the M50. The move from the current toll arrangement on the M50 to a non-stop automated toll collection facility would be completed over a number of stages, involving a phased reduction in the cashier or coin basket lanes with a corresponding increase in payments by automated methods. I have met both the NRA and NTR on this matter and I emphasised the importance of moving to open road tolling as quickly as possible on the M50.</P>
        <P>My Department is contributing to the process by reviewing the need to change, where necessary, the legislative framework so as to facilitate the introduction of open road tolling. In particular, it is likely that legislation will be needed to implement appropriate deterrents for non-payment of tolls in an open road tolling environment. I anticipate, subject to the other priorities on the legislative programme, that the draft legislation will be introduced in autumn of this year.</P>

	<P>The Road Transport Act 1932 provides the legislative basis for entry to the public transport market by private bus operators. In accordance with this legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for passenger licences to provide bus services on specific routes within the State. In accordance with long-standing practice, details of <Col N="764"/>applications received in my Department remain confidential until a decision is made.</P>
        <P>However, as of 10 May 2005, there are two applications outstanding from 2003. My Department has had extensive correspondence with these applicants. They are now at an advanced stage of consideration and I expect decisions will be given shortly in respect of them. A total of 31 applications are outstanding from 2004 and 40 applications are outstanding in 2005. In addition to these outstanding passenger licence applications for new routes, my Department also has 106 requests to amend current passenger licences under consideration.</P>
        <P>Applications under the Road Transport Act 1932 are generally dealt with on a first come, first served basis. However, pressing or exceptional circumstances can be taken into account in determining the order in which applications are dealt with.</P>

	<P>The assessment and evaluation of individual national road projects, including value for money, is undertaken by the National Roads Authority, NRA, as an integral part of the planning of projects in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the appraisal and management of capital projects and working rules for cost benefit analysis. In addition, the development and implementation of toll-based PPP projects also take account of Department of Finance interim guidelines on the assessment, approval and procurement of PPP projects.</P>
        <P>In assessing value for money of road PPP projects, the NRA prepares a financial comparator which represents the cost under traditional procurement. This is compared with the cost to the public sector under a PPP arrangement to assess which offers better value for money. This value for money comparison is undertaken at different stages of the PPP procurement process. At the final stage, the best and final offer submission which has been judged most economically advantageous is compared against the financial comparator to confirm that a toll-based PPP offers better value for money.</P>
        <P>The detailed appraisal procedures followed by the NRA for all roads projects indicate that the national roads programme represents good value for money, given the significant economic and social benefits deriving from improving our national road network. In recent years a number of independent evaluations conducted by Fitzpatrick and Associates in 2002, Indecon in 2003 and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2004 have acknowledged that the <Col N="765"/>national roads programme is, in general, well managed.</P>

        <Quest>the budget that will be provided in 2005 for the purchase of new buses by Dublin Bus; if there is a standard frequency of service required on new quality bus corridors; and if the rollout of quality bus corridors in Dublin is being restricted by the lack of new buses to provide such levels of service.</Quest>

	<P>I understand that Dublin Bus intends to purchase 70 new replacement buses, including 20 high capacity tri-axle buses, in 2005. Exchequer funding of &euro;1.2 million is being provided towards the cost of these buses. The new tri-axle buses will provide 20% more passenger carrying capacity than double deck buses.</P>
        <P>Significant Exchequer investment has been made in Dublin Bus in recent years. However, there has also been significant investment made to date under the NDP in other modes such as Luas, suburban rail lines and the DART. In light of the significant expansion of rail capacity and considering demographic changes in the city, the management of Dublin Bus is examining whether capacity on certain corridors might be better utilized to meet growing demand elsewhere. I am awaiting the outcome of this review.</P>
        <P>I have been advised by the Dublin Transportation Office that the specification for a QBC includes the expected average passenger wait time of 3 minutes at a bus stop. My Department has allocated &euro;40 million for traffic management to the Dublin Transportation Office in 2005. QBCs account for a significant proportion of the funding under this scheme. I understand the traffic management grants committee of the Dublin Transportation Office is currently prioritising the list of QBCs with a view to ensuring that the full allocation of funding, which has been provided, will be drawn down in the course of 2005.</P>
        <P>I foresee an expansion in the bus market in the greater Dublin area in the coming years, involving participation by Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and private operators. In this regard, my Department is currently in discussions with the parties concerned on the appropriate framework to give effect to such expansion.</P>

The final cost is estimated at &euro;751 million &mdash; 2005 prices.</P>

This order applies only to the carriage of munitions of war, weapons and dangerous goods and not to military personnel. <Col N="769"/>There is no limitation on the carriage of military troops on civilian aircraft if they are unaccompanied by weapons or munitions, as is sometimes the case. Therefore, my Department do not collate information with regard to the number of military troops onboard civilian aircraft.</P>
        <P>However, on the basis of information collected by Shannon Airport management, the number of US troops that have passed through Shannon Airport from 1 January 2005 to 30 April 2005, the most recent figures available, is 110,766. In the same period in 2004, the number of troops was 47,149. While in Shannon Airport, the US troops have access to the transit lounge area.

Free access to general practitioner services will be the only service available to holders of GP visit cards. Funding has been provided in 2005 for this measure and it is my intention that the required target can be met by the end of 2005. Regarding the GP visit cards, the Health Service Executive has put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for their introduction. A public information campaign will be commenced over the coming days, which will indicate the process to be followed by applicants to obtain application forms and to have their eligibility assessed by the HSE. In the first instance, the HSE will consider the applicants eligibility for a full medical card. A process of engagement with the contractor and staff representative bodies is ongoing and it is my <Col N="773"/>intention to have GP visit cards available to persons on low income as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>The Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into the State. The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that the position in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy is as follows. Drug enforcement work is carried out with the assistance of other law enforcement partner agencies, both at national and international level. Revenue constantly evaluates the effectiveness of how it manages and deploys its enforcement, anti-smuggling, intelligence and operational resources to tackle the serious threat of drug smuggling. A crucial part of this process is the constant updating of intelligence at all levels of the drugs production and supply chain network, including current national and international drug smuggling routes and the smuggling methodologies used. The Deputy will appreciate that detailed, confidential information-intelligence flow is required to ensure success in drugs interdiction.</P>
        <P>The principal entry routes used by smugglers attempting to illegally import drugs in recent years have been Dublin Port, Dublin Airport, Rosslare Harbour and also importations by the postal and express courier services. Revenue now has nine drug detector teams strategically deployed at our main ports and airports. In 2003, the Revenue Commissioners re-launched the customs drugs watch programme, which seeks to enlist the help of the public in the critical activity of reducing the supply of illicit drugs by notifying its officers on a confidential basis of suspicious activity at sea, land and air boundaries. Last year, Revenue deployed its first patrol vessel, the RCC Suirbh&eacute;ir. Based in Cork but having a national <Col N="775"/>remit, this vessel is actively engaged in drugs interdiction. There have been a number of significant seizures of drugs from pleasure craft and converted fishing vessels over the years and the patrol vessel Suirbh&eacute;ir now enables Revenue to respond better to this ever present threat.</P>
        <P>Later this year, Revenue will take delivery of a mobile container x-ray examination unit to assist in countering the smuggling of drugs and other illicit products through containerised freight traffic. The Revenue Commissioners will continue to broaden and deepen its drugs enforcement work on an ongoing operational basis with other partner law enforcement agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Naval Service, Europol and other Customs services to ensure greater effectiveness in disrupting the illicit drugs supply chain.</P>

	<P>Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds are based in a number of different locations in Dublin. Staff numbering 230 are due to decentralise to County Roscommon. It is proposed to build new office accommodation for the remaining staff at Church Street, Dublin. A re-evaluation of their requirements, in the context of decentralisation, is currently under way.</P>

	<P>As I have stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 194 dated 10 May 2005, the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, announced in budget 2004, will see the transfer of 210 posts to Dungarvan. Initial data from the central applications facility indicate that, while 15 staff of Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, have applied to decentralise to Dungarvan, there are a further 47 expressions of interest in decentralising to Dungarvan OSI by civil servants.</P>
        <P>All organisations that are decentralising, including OSI, have prepared and submitted an implementation plan as requested by the decentralisation implementation group, DIG. This plan included detailed material on all issues to be addressed in terms of people, property and business planning and will be further developed as additional information emerges. In its next report, the DIG will deal with locations and organisations not covered in its November report, which did not include Dungarvan. Regarding property acquisition, I understand from the OPW that it has chosen a site for the decentralisation project in Dungarvan and details of the deal are being finalised with the land owner.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the income tax legislation provides for tax relief in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual to an approved college in respect of certain full-time or part-time undergraduate courses, postgraduate courses and information technology and foreign language courses. On a specific note, for the purposes of the relief, the establishment in question is an approved college, the course is regarded as a qualifying course and, therefore, the fees payable, subject to a maximum, qualify for tax relief. The fact that a student is a mature student does not alter his or her entitlements to tax relief. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, he can forward details to my Department which will pass on such details to the Revenue Commissioners to have the relevant claim processed.</P>

	<P>The Report on the Dublin Coastal Flooding Protection Project has been received by the Office of Public Works in the last few weeks. It is a very detailed document and is currently being examined.</P>
        <P>The project was commissioned by Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council in association with the OPW and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and set out to examine the causes and impacts of flooding from Portmarnock to Booterstown and to identify appropriate measures to deal with the flood risk in this area.</P>
        <P>I understand the report recommends a number of actions which include early flood warning systems and the development of a number of flood defence schemes. The construction costs of the proposals are estimated between &euro;64 million and &euro;95 million.</P>
        <P>When the Report has been fully examined which because of its size and complexity will take some time, the OPW will meet city council officials and the other relevant bodies to discuss the proposals with a view to developing a priority list of measures which could be undertaken in the coming years. Any funding which may be required from the OPW will be considered at that stage in the context of the OPW&rsquo;s annual budget for flood relief projects, the large number of flood alleviation projects and non-structural measures currently being advanced by the OPW and the urgency attaching to the various measures recommended in the report on the Dublin coastal flooding protection project.</P>

	<P>The Government is aware of the particular human rights issues affecting the indigenous peoples in Colombia. The most recent statement of Irish and European Union policy in this regard is set out in the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 13 December 2004 which stressed the importance of protecting the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples, as reaffirmed in the Declaration of Guadalajara. In the Declaration of Guadalajara, which was adopted during the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2004, the countries of the EU and Latin America and the Caribbean reiterated their commitment to the promotion and protection of all human rights and expressed their full commitment to promote the active involvement of minorities and indigenous peoples in the public policies and programmes that concern them.</P>
        <P>An official from my Department took part in the second meeting on international support for Colombia which took place in Cartagena de Indias on 3-4 February 2005. This meeting issued the Cartagena Declaration which, <i>inter alia</i>, encouraged the Colombian Government to continue with the improvement of the severe conditions experienced by vulnerable populations, especially the displaced, indigenous and afro-Colombian communities.</P>
        <P>At the recent 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland supported two resolutions on human rights and indigenous issues. Ireland also worked actively for the inclusion of strong language on the situation of indigenous groups in Col<Col N="781"/>ombia in the chair&rsquo;s Statement on the Situation of Human Rights in Colombia adopted by the commission. The final statement deplored the continuing violence against indigenous groups and violations of their economic, social and cultural rights. Furthermore, the statement encouraged the Colombian Government to take special and urgent measures to avoid the forced displacement of indigenous communities. It also appealed to the illegal armed groups to respect the identity and integrity of the indigenous communities. In addition, in the statement of the European Union on the situation of human rights in Colombia delivered at the Commission on Human Rights on 22 April 2005, the EU called on the Colombian Government to take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of the human rights of vulnerable parts of the population such as the indigenous community.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105 to 110, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>The EPAs, which are to enter into force by 1 January 2008, are a part of the legally-binding Cotonou Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, states and the European Union, EU.</P>
        <P>EPAs are intended first and foremost as instruments for development to foster the smooth and gradual integration of ACP states into the world economy, with due regard for their own political choices and their own development priorities, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication. They combine trade and wider development issues in a unified framework, while taking account of the specific economic, social and environmental circumstances of each regional group and its component states. For instance, recent discussions between the Commission and the Southern African Development Community, SADC, which has many of the features of a customs union, focused on how those least developed SADC member countries would be affected by further trade integration under the EPAs. This overall approach addresses the particular concern of Ireland and other member states that development and poverty reduction should be the principal objectives of the EPAs.</P>
        <P>As far as the impact of liberalisation of trade is concerned, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to Article 37(7) of the Cotonou Agreement, which states that the negotiations on the EPAs:</P>
        <P LI="1">shall take account of the level of development and the socio-economic impact of trade measures on ACP countries and their capacity to adapt and adjust their economies to the liberalisation process. Negotiations will therefore be as flexible as possible in establishing the duration of a sufficient transitional period, the final product coverage, taking into account sensitive sectors, and the degree of asymmetry in terms of timetable for tariff dismantlement, while remaining in conformity with WTO rules then prevailing.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As trade is a European Community competence, it is the European Commission which conducts the negotiations on the EPAs between the EU and six regional groupings of ACP states on behalf of the member states. The Commission provides the Council with regular updates on the progress of the negotiations. We are satisfied that the Commission is discharging its mandate in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and in a manner which is sensitive to <Col N="783"/>the particular concerns of the ACP states. I note in particular, in the context of the further progression of EPA negotiations, Commissioner Mandelson&rsquo;s statement that he is putting the EPA process under continuing review, through a mechanism to ensure that at every stage in the negotiations the development dimension is put first.</P>
        <P>Ireland is carefully following developments in the EPA negotiations process and will continue to do so. In discussions within the Council and its bodies, we will be insisting that the Commission take forward its negotiating responsibilities in accordance with the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement and in a manner which is responsive to the particular concerns of the ACP states.</P>

	<P>The Fairtrade mark is an independent assurance that producers in developing countries receive a fair price for their products. It provides a vital opportunity for producers in the poorest developing countries to access international markets on fair terms of trade and also for people in Ireland to make a practical contribution to improving the conditions of producers in developing countries.</P>
        <P>I fully support the objectives of the Fairtrade campaign and am glad to confirm that Fairtrade products, such as tea and coffee, are in use in the Department of Foreign Affairs including at events organised by our protocol division in Iveagh House for visiting dignitaries etc.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also wish to note that since 1996, Development Co-operation Ireland has been making grant aid available to Fairtrade Mark Ireland, the national fair trade labelling organisation. In 2004, Fairtrade Mark Ireland received a grant of &euro;40,994 through the development education grants scheme to support its main activities including: promotion of the concept of Fairtrade with businesses; development education; and raising public awareness, in particular through the Fairtrade Fortnight and the Fairtrade Towns initiative.</P>
        <P>Development Co-operation Ireland is also assisting community-based Fairtrade agricultural projects in Central America. Over the three-year period 2003-05, funding of &euro;567,000 has been provided to promote access to fair-traded marketing options for coffee cooperatives in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Funding is channelled through the regional office of the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation based in El Salvador. Del Campo, a Fairtrade certified co-operative in Nicaragua, has received funding of &euro;187,000 to support small grain producers over three years to process and market a variety of products including sesame seed.</P>

Eligible persons are employed by managing agents, with the support of a grant from F&Aacute;S for this purpose.

People who leave JI voluntarily may be replaced by community employment participants. These arrangements are intended to ensure the maintenance of the provision of a network of valuable community services throughout the country.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 127 together.</P>
        <P>The job initiative programme is one of a number of F&Aacute;S schemes in which lone parents may participate. Under the programme, full time employment is provided in the social economy for individuals who are over 35 years and fulfil certain criteria. Lone parents can qualify for the programme if they have been on one parent family payment, unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or any combination of these schemes for a minimum of five years.</P>
        <P>Figures received from F&Aacute;S confirm that there are 450 lone parents who are on the job initiative programme. With effect from 1 January 2005, these and other job initiative employees earn a minimum of &euro;346.40 for their 39 hour week, substantially more than the national minimum wage. This is an increase from the minimum &euro;318.40 payment that applied for the calendar year 2004, which in itself was higher than the &euro;293 upper income threshold for receipt of the one parent family payment.</P>
        <P>I can confirm, therefore, that due to the job initiative earnings being substantially over the income threshold for receipt of the one parent family payment, the recent increase in earnings for job initiative employees, effective from 1 January this year, cannot have led to the loss of the one parent family payment for any participant.</P>
        <P>I would also like to point out that job initiative employees with families may be entitled to family income supplement, a weekly payment for families, including one parent families, at work on low pay. All employees working a minimum of 19 hours per week and with at least one qualifying child are entitled to apply, provided the family income is below the qualifying income limit. For the current year, qualifying income limits for families start at &euro;446 per week for a family with one child and increase to &euro;623 per week for families with eight or more children.</P>

	<P>The conditions for receipt of the extended respite care grant are set out in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005. The following conditions will apply: the carer must be providing full-time care to a person who is in need of such care; as is the case with recipients of carers allowance, a full-time carer must not be engaged in employment for more than ten hours per week; and those who are on unemployment payments will be excluded since they are required to be available for and actively seeking full-time work.</P>
        <P>I am committed to continuing to expand and increase the benefits and supports available to carers. By increasing the respite care grant to &euro;1,000 and significantly expanding it to include thousands more recipients, we are going some of the way towards giving carers a badly needed break and also recognition for their commitment and compassion.</P>

	<P>Exercises to test the robustness of the emergency planning arrangements for aviation are a key component of the emergency planning framework. The authorities at Shannon Airport are required, under the Irish Aviation Authority&rsquo;s aerodrome licensing procedures, to establish an emergency plan that provides for the co-ordination of the actions <Col N="792"/>to be taken in an emergency occurring at the aerodrome or in its vicinity. The plan must be tested by conducting a full-scale emergency exercise every two years.

	<P>The opening hours of NCT centres is a matter for the management of National Car Testing Service Limited having regard to the broad range of customer service parameters for the service set down in the car testing contract. Each test centre should open for a minimum of 20 hours each week between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays, and, subject to local demand, have one early opening per week from 8 a.m. and one late evening closing to 8 p.m. and be open for at least four hours at weekends. A test centre&rsquo;s opening hours are published in notices on display in the test centre concerned.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the company that at the recent public holiday weekend, all NCT test centres closed at their normal closing time on Friday, 29 April 2005, which in the case of the Northpoint test centre was 12 noon, and were closed on Saturday, 30 April, Sunday, 1 May, and Monday, 2 May. Where a test centre is normally open over a weekend, the notice of opening hours on display in the test centre indicates that such a service is not available on a public holiday weekend.</P>
        <P>A retest must be completed within 30 days of the initial test. It is the responsibility of the car owner to return to the test centre for the retest within 30 days of the initial test having regard to the opening times of the test centre concerned. I understand, however, that the company takes a lenient view of circumstances where the 30th day falls on the weekend of a public holiday and, insofar as is practicable to do so, the retest will be carried out on the next open day.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to advise that the company will be contacting the person concerned shortly with a view to arranging the required retest in this case.</P>

        <P>The scheduling and timetabling of trains is a day-to-day operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to consider. On the basis of projected demand into the future, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has submitted a greater Dublin integrated rail network plan which proposes the enhancement of all suburban and outer suburban services into Dublin. The proposals are being examined by my Department at present in the context of the multi-annual investment framework for transport.</P>
        <P>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann plans to place most of the 36 diesel railcars on the Sligo-Dublin line to increase capacity and to remove older rolling stock from service. This will be of direct benefit to Maynooth passengers. The balance of the new fleet will be assigned to the Maynooth and Kildare outer suburban services to increase capacity on those lines.</P>
        <P>These allocations will improve the capacity on individual trains by up to 33%. This capacity increase comes on top of a capacity increase of 24% on the Maynooth line and an increase of up to 160% on the Kildare line delivered in the past 18 months.</P>

The options, including the lowering of the floor of the tunnel, for increasing the height of the tunnel were also considered by the NRA and by Dublin City Council.

	<P>In accordance with EU Directive 96/96/EC, passenger cars are required to undergo a roadworthiness test when they are four years old and every two years thereafter with the test due dates determined by reference to the date of first registration of the vehicle. In the case of taxis the national car test schedule is determined by reference to the taxi licence application and renewal dates. As the duration of a taxi licence is one year, taxis are required to undergo the national car test annually.</P>
        <P>Where a vehicle licensed as a taxi reverts to private use the national car test certificate issued for the vehicle continues to be valid until the expiry date specified on it at which stage a national car test is required.

        <P>The draft EU regulation provides that elements of the rural development programmes will be delivered by local action groups who must: propose an integrated local development strategy; have already been involved in the delivery of a Leader initiative or be a new group representing partners from the various locally based socio-economic sectors in the territory concerned; and have the ability to define and implement a development strategy for the area. When this process at EU level is complete, my Department will look at the opportunities and delivery mechanisms to be used in maximising the available funding for the benefit of rural communities.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office is responsible for the collection of statistics in relation to imports of meat and meat products. The following tables, which were compiled from data supplied by that office, set out the details requested by the Deputy. In relation to the tables the following should be noted: in certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish products that were originally the subject of an export from this country; the information available for imports from EU member states does not differentiate between products originating in the EU country and those originating in third countries that may already be in free circulation within the Community; and detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU.</P>
        <P>It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU. Brazil is an approved country.</P>
        <P>In order to be an approved third country it must: appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country; have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicines controls, zoonoses controls and other food law; and have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission.</P>
        <P>The animal products must be sourced from establishments that are approved and must bear an EU approved health mark. Exporting establishments must have: standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments; effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities; and traceability or labelling in accordance with the systems approved by <Col N="798"/>the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU member states.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>Importers of animal products must be registered with my Department. They are required to give advance notice of importation and, following import, are required to keep records of importation available for inspection by the Department for a period of three years.</P>
        <P>Imported animal products must be accompanied by the appropriate commercial documentation showing country and approval number of the establishment of production and, in the case of meat and meat extracts imported from third countries, a health certificate conforming to the models set down in EU legislation.</P>
        <P>While there is free movement for trade within the EU all consignments from third countries must first be landed at a border inspection post, BIP, that has been approved by the FVO and must undergo documentary, identity and physical checks. These latter are carried out at frequencies laid down in EU law. In Ireland BIPs approved for the processing imports of animal products are located at Dublin Port and Shannon Airport. The FVO carries out monitoring and inspection of each member state&rsquo;s BIPs to ensure the conditions for import of animal products into Europe, provided under the harmonised legislation, are being correctly applied.</P>
        <P>Once it has been established that imported animal product has met all the required conditions it is released for free circulation within the community. Copies of the BIP clearance document and the health certificate must accompany the consignment to its destination. Imports failing to comply with these veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination. If non-compliance is established they are returned to the exporting country or destroyed.</P>
        <P>Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country the Commission, in consultation with the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain, may introduce specific controls by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health. Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from EU countries or regions of countries may also be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU.</P><Col N="799"/><Col N="800"/>

	<P>The numbers of mushroom growers in the past three years were: 2002, 365 growers; 2003, 289 growers; and 2004, 228 growers.</P>
        <P>There is no registration requirement for mushroom growers. A Teagasc survey carried out in February indicated that there were 201 active growers in the country. The fall in grower numbers indicates that the mushroom industry continues to consolidate around operations with increasing scale and efficiency.</P>

        <Quest>if she will reconsider her decision in relation to an application for <i>force majeure</i> for a person (details supplied) in County Clare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>The person named, having been notified that the circumstances outlined by her did not satisfy the criteria for <i>force majeure</i>-exceptional circumstances under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, submitted an appeal to the independent single payment appeals committee.</P>
        <P>Following a full examination of the circumstances outlined in the appeal, the independent single payment appeals committee made a recommendation and a letter issued to the person named on 7 October 2004. The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld.</P>
        <P>The person named also submitted an application for consideration in respect of the new entrant and inheritance measures of the single payment scheme. Following processing of the applications I am pleased to advise that both the new entrant and inheritance applications were successful. However, the new entrant measure was found to be the more financially beneficial. An official from my Department has contacted the person named and advised her of the revised number and value of her entitlements, and informed her of the closing date of 16 May 2005 for receipt of single payment applications.</P>

	<P>Under the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations 1995, animals must be restrained in an appropriate manner in such a way as to spare them any avoidable pain, suffering, agitation, injury or contusions. In the case of ritual slaughter, restraint of bovine animals before slaughter using a mechanical method intended to avoid any pain, suffering or agitation and any injuries or contusions to the animals is obligatory. Bovine animals must not be suspended before killing. These regulations are applicable only within the territory of the European Union.</P>

	<P>My Department has a comprehensive legislative framework in place to safeguard the welfare of animals during transport. For export refund purposes, under EU legislation cattle are subject to a veterinary inspection on arrival at third country destinations. On a number of occasions my Department has sent Department veterinary inspectors to the Lebanon to witness the unloading of Irish cattle and to verify that the animals are unloaded and treated in a humane manner. When animals have landed in a third country, transportation becomes a matter for the authorities there to deal with in accordance with the laws of that country.</P>

        <Quest>the steps she is taking to encourage the Lebanon to import Irish beef only in the form of meat, not live animals; her views on whether slaughter near to the farm of rearing is preferable both in terms of animal welfare protection and meat exports adding value to the product and creating employment here.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Less than 8% of all Irish beef exports in 2004 were in the form of live cattle. Exports to the Lebanon that year constituted less than 10% of all live exports and the Lebanese trade was only 20% of what it was five years ago. Live exports, while small in volume terms, are a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s livestock industry, and are essential for price competition and maintaining farm incomes.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the focus of the Irish beef industry has been to add value and to broaden and expand its market reach at EU retail level, <Col N="803"/>shifting its orientation away from international commodity markets and into the higher priced internal EU marketplace. I am aware of the social, moral and economic imperative to ensure that the transport of animals over long distances is conducted in a manner which safeguards the welfare of animals being transported and minimises the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. The vast majority of live exports take place to other EU member states.</P>
        <P>The preservation of the animal health status of the country, the international reputation of veterinary certification services and the existence and application of a regulatory framework ensures that high standards and welfare considerations are central to the live export trade.</P>

	<P>The 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and section 2 <Col N="805"/>of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, defines a refugee, <i>inter alia</i>, as: &ldquo;a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of gender specific persecution, I would point out that section 1 of the Refugee Act, as amended, defines &ldquo;membership of a particular social group&rdquo; as including &ldquo;membership of a trade union and also includes membership of a group of persons whose defining characteristic is their belonging to the female or the male sex or having a particular sexual orientation.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Consideration of individual applications for refugee status based on gender grounds or otherwise is a matter for two independent statutory offices, namely, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner which considers asylum applications at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which considers applications at appeals stage.</P>
        <P>It should be further noted that where, after a detailed investigation as described above, an asylum applicant is found not to be in need of refugee status and the Minister proposes to deport the person under the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the safety of returning that person must also be considered in deciding whether to make a deportation order. The legislation requires that safety of return is considered at the level of the individual in every case and before a deportation order is made. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries. I am satisfied that the procedures operated ensure as far as possible that persons are not returned in dangerous circumstances.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.</P>
        <P>The European Union has a role in ensuring a more effective, joint approach to cross-border problems such as trafficking in and smuggling of human beings. I can inform the Deputy that Ireland&rsquo;s policies in this field complement developments at both the EU and the broader international level.</P>
        <P>Legislation is currently being prepared in my Department which will criminalise trafficking in human beings for the purpose of their sexual and labour exploitation as provided for in the EU Council Framework Decision on combating trafficking in persons and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. This legislation will also take account of the recently negotiated Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings.</P>
        <P>I can further inform the Deputy that a range of practical measures and policies are in place to combat this type of crime. The Garda national immigration bureau, which was established in 2000, has an investigation unit which investigates the trafficking of human beings. I am informed by the Garda authorities that members attached to this unit have attended relevant courses to assist them in their investigations into the trafficking of human beings. These courses have been organised by Europol and European Police College, CEPOL, on an EU wide basis.</P>
        <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also attend regular conferences in Europe, which facilitate an exchange of information between the EU member states, Europol and Interpol, as well as inter-governmental consultations on asylum, refugee and migration policies in Europe, North America and Australia.</P>
        <P>Victims of trafficking are always treated sympathetically by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the current immigration system in Ireland also allows the authorities to deal with the victims of trafficking in a sympathetic and pragmatic way. It is recognised that it is in the interests of both the victims of trafficking and the authorities to co-operate with a view to ensuring the protection of the victims and the prosecution of the perpetrators. Although Ireland has not opted to participate in the Council directive dealing with the issuing of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings, in practice a similar regime can be implemented under existing Irish legislation.</P>
        <P>During the course of Garda investigations the garda&iacute; liaise as necessary with Ruhama, a non-governmental organisation which assists women who are the victims of this type of offence. Furthermore, my Department has provided funding to this organisation, towards the employment of a coordinator on trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Ruhama is in fact <Col N="807"/>represented on the national steering committee on violence against women and I expect that the strategic plan currently being drawn up to chart the activities of the committee for the next five years will address further the question of trafficking for sexual exploitation.</P>

	<P>The principal objective of the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill 2004, which is before the Seanad, is to provide a clear statutory basis for the registration of deeds and titles <Col N="809"/>on computer in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds and for a digital mapping system, with a view to preparing the way for an electronic conveyancing system. This involves the repeal of existing Registry of Deeds legislation, the earliest of which dates back to 1707, and its replacement with provisions more suited to modern conditions and amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964.</P>

        <P>The total number of dealings on hands in the Land Registry at 30 April 2005 was 156,947. Of these, 38,833 were the subject of queries and cannot be proceeded with until a satisfactory reply is received. The &ldquo;live&rdquo; arrear was therefore 118,114. The total number of cases completed from 1 January to 30 April 2005 was 73,197 or 18,300 per month. Therefore the overall national average waiting time in respect of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; arrear is 6.45 months.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to complete cases varies depending on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case, investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented, mapping requirements, the volume of business being transacted, the level of resources available at any particular time and the time at which the present computerised system was introduced in the Land Registry office for each county. Where a case is urgent and this is <Col N="811"/>brought to the attention of the Land Registry office, in accordance with its customer service policy the matter is dealt with expeditiously.</P>

	<P>An application form for permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child under the revised arrangements, was made on behalf of the person concerned by a third party and received in my Department on 1 April 2005.</P>
        <P>The revised arrangements apply to persons who are currently resident in the State and have been resident in the State with their Irish born child on a continuous basis since the child&rsquo;s birth. In this case the person concerned is currently resident in Australia with her Irish born child. In <Col N="812"/>addition, the person concerned has not herself made an application for consideration to remain under the revised arrangements. Rather it was made on her behalf by a relative and, furthermore, the application form was incomplete.</P>
        <P>Given that this was one of the last application forms received and that applications are dealt with insofar as is possible in order of receipt, it will be some weeks before this case is processed to conclusion. However, on the basis of the information available from the incomplete application, it is unlikely that permission to remain will be granted.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 181, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In relation to crime figures the Deputy will be aware that on becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I arranged for the publication of headline crime statistics on a quarterly basis in order to improve the quality of information available to the public. While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to 6 per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. In interpreting these figures, account has also to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The <Col N="813"/>Deputy will also wish to be aware that, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</P>
        <P>The following tables show the headline offences, for the years 2000 to 2004 inclusive, for the Carlow Garda district which covers the Bagenalstown area, the Baltinglass Garda district, which covers the Tullow area, and the Thomastown Garda district, which covers the Borris area.</P>
        <P>The number of Garda personnel assigned to each station, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public. In this regard, I should like to mention that in addition to the specific resources available to stations, there has also been a considerable increase since 1997 in the number of garda&iacute; serving in national units. Specialist Garda units such as the Garda national drugs unit, the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda bureau of fraud investigation operating under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services has enabled the Garda <Col N="814"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle serious crime effectively. These specialist units work very closely with garda&iacute; operating at district and divisional level.</P>
        <P>In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P><Col N="813"/>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr.</NameTxt>
	<P>McDowell): The Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibited discrimination in vocational training and employment on nine grounds including the ground of age. Section 6(3) of the Act confined the application of the age ground to persons aged between 18 and 65 years. Following amendments to the Employment Equality Act 1998 under the Equality Act 2004, the purpose of which, <i>inter alia</i>, was to give effect to Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, both the 18 and 65 year age limits have been removed and the provisions of the Act on the age ground are now extended to persons who have reached the maximum age at which there is a statutory obligation to attend school.</P>
        <P>At the same time, Article 6.1 of the directive permits differences of treatment on the ground of <Col N="817"/>age if, within the context of national law they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary. In this regard, with respect to the employment rights of younger employees, the provisions of both the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 are subject to exclusions under section 17(4) of the Employment Equality Act as amended. The setting of minimum hourly rates of pay under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

	<P>The persons concerned, a Bosnian national and three Croatian nationals, arrived in the State on 28 May 2001 and 4 July 2001 respectively and claimed asylum. Their applications were refused following a first instance determination by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner which was upheld, at appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on 30 June 2003.</P>
        <P>They were notified of the decision to refuse them refugee status by letters dated 30 July 2003 and 13 August 2003 in which they were informed of the three options open to them at that point, that is, to leave the State before their cases were considered for deportation; consent to the making of deportation orders in respect of them; or make written representations, within 15 working days, to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out the reasons they should not be deported, namely, why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>Their cases were examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. On 27 April 2005, deportation orders were made in respect of them. This decision was made following a full and comprehensive examination of the family&rsquo;s case, including consideration of representations received on their behalf from the refugee legal service for temporary leave to remain in the State. Notice of the orders were served by registered post requiring them to present themselves to the Garda national immigration bureau today Thursday, 12 May 2005 for travel arrangements to be put in place to effect their return.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the deportation orders is now an operational matter for the Garda national immigration bureau.</P>

	<P>An application for a certificate of naturalisation by the person referred to by the Deputy was originally received in the citizenship section of my Department in December 2004. The application was returned at that stage as the statutory declaration was not completed properly.</P>
        <P>The form was resubmitted in March 2005 through the Deputy&rsquo;s office but, unfortunately, it was still incorrect. The form has been returned once more to the applicant for rectification. Every statutory declaration must be signed by the person making it in the presence of the person before whom it is made. In this case, the declaration was signed by the applicant four months prior to the date of its attestation by the person before whom it was made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 to 191, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Green Paper on applicable law and jurisdiction in divorce matters published by the European Commission on 14 March 2005. The purpose of the paper is to launch a wide-ranging consultation with interested parties on possible measures to be taken at Community level so as to create a procedure which would operate throughout the EU on the question of applicable law and jurisdiction in divorce matters which have a cross-border dimension. The text of the Green Paper is available on the European Commission&rsquo;s website:<i>http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/justice_<?oasys _jy?><?oasys _dc28-?>home/news/consulting_public/news_consulting_<?oasys _jy?><?oasys _dc0-?>public_en.htm. </i> I wish to emphasise that the Green Paper is not a legal instrument. It is merely a mechanism to launch a wide-ranging consultation. It goes without saying, therefore, that it has no impact on Ireland&rsquo;s family law including our divorce law. Indeed, the Commission Green Paper itself acknowledges that among possible ways forward is no change in the status quo on the basis that the issue does not warrant Community action.</P>
        <P>The treaty provisions governing judicial co-operation in civil law matters provide that Ireland has an opt in to measures in this area, either when a proposal is tabled or following its adoption. Were the Commission to come forward with proposals arising from the Green Paper, which is by no means certain, any exercise of an opt in by Ireland to the measure is subject to Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution which requires prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Ireland is not bound by any measure to which it does not opt in. Furthermore, the relevant treaty provisions provide for decision making by unanimity in relation to all family law measures in the field of <Col N="820"/>judicial co-operation in civil matters. Measures are only permitted by the treaty to the extent that they have cross border implications and are necessary for the functioning of the internal market, Articles 65 and 67 of the TEC.</P>
        <P>I also wish to assure the House that Ireland&rsquo;s entitlement to opt into civil law measures is preserved by the constitutional treaty, protocol 19. Likewise, decision-making by unanimity is retained for the purposes of family law measures. The relevant provisions of the constitutional treaty also continue to relate measures in the civil law area to matters having cross border implications and the proper functioning of the internal market as well as on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition. The constitutional treaty also provides that unanimity will apply in relation to the adoption of legislative instruments in the field of judicial co-operation in civil matters which are concerned with family law with cross-border implications, constitutional treaty article III-269. While the constitutional treaty provides for the possibility of a change in the decision making arrangements for this purpose to qualified majority voting and co-decision with the European Parliament, this again can only occur by unanimous decision, Article III-269(3).</P>
        <P>The Commission has invited interested parties to submit comments to them on the Green Paper before 30 September 2005.</P>
        <P>In accordance with Oireachtas scrutiny arrangements, the Green Paper has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. It has been referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for information and consideration and also to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>The Government will convey its view on the matter to the Commission in advance of the September deadline. The Government&rsquo;s starting point will be that any measures that may be taken in this area will not be allowed to undermine our existing domestic law on divorce. However, I should like to make clear that the Green Paper does not contain any proposal to harmonise the laws of member states on divorce.</P>
        <P>With regard to other proposals on family law emanating from the EU, the Commission published a Green Paper on maintenance obligations in April 2004 and a Green Paper on succession and wills in March 2005. The purpose in both cases is the launch of a wide-ranging consultation. Both papers have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with Oireachtas scrutiny arrangements. The latter paper has been referred recently to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for information.</P>

	<P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 891 of 12 April 2005, issues were raised with my Department regarding the terms of reference of the inquiry referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>I have been advised that the terms of reference of the inquiry were <i>ultra vires</i>. Accordingly, I decided that the best way to proceed was to terminate the original inquiry and to establish a new inquiry with new terms of reference. County Clare Vocational Education Committee was informed of this decision. I am satisfied that the new inquiry&rsquo;s terms of reference come within the scope of an inquiry under the Vocational Education Act 1930. I understand that the officer conducting the inquiry is taking steps to contact all relevant persons and intends to conclude the inquiry as speedily as possible.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 195 to 197, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the head of the college covered by the Deputy&rsquo;s questions, resigned from that position on Friday, 29 April. Arising from this development and various related matters I have asked that one of the country&rsquo;s leading independent accountancy firms examine the question of the use of moneys paid by my Department to the institution in question. I have also asked that a report be prepared as promptly as possible and that the outcome be presented to me once completed. I intend to make its findings public. At this stage, there is nothing to show that funding provided by my Department to the institution in question has not been applied solely and properly for its intended purposes, but it is important to secure confirmation that this is the case.</P>
        <P>I also commend the staff of the institution in question and acknowledge that they are ensuring that the education of students is of paramount importance. Despite the current difficulties at the institution, they continue to provide a properly professional service to students. I have been assured that the lectures, teaching practice and examinations are proceeding as planned.</P>
        <P>The recent reported difficulties at the institution in question relate to the employee-employer relationship between the head of the college and that person&rsquo;s employers, which, I understand, were subject to legal proceedings. In this regard, it is not considered appropriate for me to make any comment on them.</P>
        <P>Apart from the provision of funding, my Department also has a role regarding the quality of graduates from the college. This role is similar to its role<i> vis-&agrave;-vis</i> other State-supported colleges of this nature. My Department&rsquo;s inspectorate actively monitors the quality of the graduates on an ongoing basis to ensure that the highest quality students graduate from all colleges of this nature. This is a well-established monitoring process and one, which has worked very well.</P>
        <P>Senior officials from my Department met the trustees and a number of members of the board of governors of the institute in question yesterday and have been assured by them that all monies provided by my Department have been applied for the purpose for which they are allocated.</P>

	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the recently established National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs, SEN, supports. Some 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s officials have been informed by the NCSE that a number of applications have been received for special needs assistant supports from the school concerned including the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The matter has been referred to the local SENO who will be in direct contact with the school authorities shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy is aware, the application for special educational teaching support for the pupil concerned was referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, for determination. The SENO examined the application and expressed the opinion that the pupil&rsquo;s special educational needs appear to be within the high incidence disability category and therefore does not qualify for individual hours resource teaching support.</P>
        <P>With regard to teaching supports for pupils within the high incidence categories, my Department has now completed its review of the general allocation, GA, system of resource teaching support. The new model replaces the one notified to schools in June 2004, which has been reviewed to take account of difficulties that it may have caused for smaller schools. Some 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to facilitate the implementation of the new GA system. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 per<Col N="824"/>manent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts will be provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system. It is a matter for the school to make arrangements to provide teaching support to those pupils who qualify for such support from its GA allocation.</P>
        <P>My Department is now devising school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the GA system. These will be notified to schools shortly along with the details of each school&rsquo;s individual allocation. This communication will clarify the position regarding the resource and learning support allocation available to the school referred to by the Deputy. My Department is also finalising a circular for schools, which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue before the end of the current school year.</P>
        <P>My Department has been advised by the SENO that the pupil has been granted the services of a full time special needs assistant, SNA. The school authorities were notified accordingly on 21 April 2005.</P>

	<P>The higher education grants scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992. An &ldquo;approved institution&rdquo; is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher edu<Col N="827"/>cation in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years&rsquo; duration at undergraduate level and not less than one year&rsquo;s duration at postgraduate level, being a course or courses of which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.</P>
        <P>The annual higher education grants scheme sets out a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the scheme. The approved institutions mainly comprise the publicly funded third level institutions. However, several religious and other institutions have been admitted to the scheme over the years.</P>
        <P>Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, Dublin, is included in the list of approved colleges under my Department&rsquo;s 2004 higher education grants scheme in respect of the following courses: national certificate in philosophical studies, a two-year, full-time course; Bachelor of Arts in philosophy; BA in theology and philosophy; BA in theology and pastoral care, a four-year, full-time course; BA in theology and anthropology, from 2003-04, a four-year, full-time course; graduate diploma in spirituality, a one-year postgraduate course; graduate diploma in applied spirituality, a one-year postgraduate course; MA in spirituality, a two-year postgraduate course; MA in philosophy by research and thesis; MA in theology by research and thesis; MA in biblical studies; MA in faith and culture studies, from 2003-04, a one-year full-time course; PhD in philosophy; and PhD in theology.</P>
        <P>Candidates intending to pursue any of the approved courses at the institute are advised to contact their local authority with a view to being assessed for grant assistance.</P>
        <P>My Department, to date, has received no representations from Milltown Institute of Theology, Dublin, regarding the inclusion of additional courses under the 2005 higher education grant scheme.</P>

	<P>My Department has not received any notification that the person referred to by the Deputy has been refused enrolment to the school in question. My Department has requested the National Educational Welfare Board, or NEWB, to contact the parents of the person referred to by the Deputy. The NEWB is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. My Department has also written to the parents informing them of their right, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, to appeal a decision by any recognised school to refuse enrolment to their child.</P>
        <P>Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</P>
        <P>Information regarding the section 29 appeals procedures, including an appeals application form and contact details for the relevant section of my Department, has been sent to the parent of the student referred to by the Deputy. To date, no such appeal has been lodged with my Department. The parent has also been advised to contact the senior educational welfare officer for the area to seek assistance in the matter.</P>

	<P>The Social Partnership Agreement <Col N="830"/>2003-2005, Sustaining Progress, provided for modernisation of the education sector. As part of the modernisation process, arrangements with regard to standardised mid-term breaks and holiday periods at Christmas and Easter were agreed following discussions at the Teachers&rsquo; Conciliation Council which involved union and management interests.</P>
        <P>Once schools adhere to the agreed standardisation, they have local flexibility in determining how they make up the required number of teaching days, 183 days in respect of primary and 167 days in respect of post-primary schools. The Department does not centrally determine whether a school opts to have a closure for any particular event once the overall number of teaching days has been delivered by the school over the course of the year. That approach aims to strike a balance between allowing schools some local discretion while at the same time ensuring that pupils get their full entitlement to education. It is, of course, essential that there be the greatest possible consultation with parents and that sufficient notice be given regarding any school closure.</P>
        <P>Schools may use their discretionary days, where available, to determine the precise start and end of the school year. However, it is recognised that the commencement of certificate examinations will mean that post-primary schools will not be open for tuition beyond the Friday preceding the June bank holiday in any year. The expectation is that to meet the overall requirement of a minimum of 183 days at primary level or 167 at post-primary level the school year will normally commence in the week that 1 September falls.</P>
        <P>In reality, most post-primary schools would not have any discretionary days but where they do, the arrangements provide some limited flexibility to schools on certain other days outside the defined periods.</P>

	<P>My Department&rsquo;s guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing came into effect on 13 April 2005. Their purpose is to support the accommodation of rural housing needs, while ensuring that housing development in rural areas is sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms.</P>
        <P>Draft guidelines were published in March 2004 to give all those interested an opportunity to comment before the guidelines were finalised in statutory form. In the meantime, planning authorities were asked to implement the draft guidelines in exercising their functions under the Planning and Development Act 2000. My Department received more than 105 submissions from interested organisations and individuals in regard to the draft guidelines. Many of the suggestions contained in the submissions have been incorporated into the final guidelines.</P>
        <P>The guidelines provide that reasonable proposals on suitable sites for persons who are part of and contribute to the rural community should be accommodated. This is subject to the need for proper consideration of matters such as adequate wastewater disposal and road safety. The guidelines state that the housing needs of emigrants who now wish to return to their home places on retirement or for other reasons should be facilitated. There is also a provision which indicates that planning authorities should grant permission in cases where exceptional health circumstances, as certified by a doctor and the relevant disability <Col N="836"/>organisation, may require a person to live in a particular environment or close to family support.</P>
        <P>The guidelines stress the need for a balanced and informed approach by planning authorities in assessing the design aspects of proposals and not to be overly prescriptive. They also place a stronger emphasis on a better and more courteous service from planning authorities and improved co-operation between planning authorities and applicants, particularly at the pre-planning phase of applications. The application of the new guidelines will serve to enhance housing development in rural areas in a sustainable fashion. Local authorities have been implementing the draft guidelines since March 2004 and have been asked to implement the finalised guidelines since their launch on 13 April 2005.</P>
        <P>I intend that my Department will monitor the effectiveness of the guidelines. My Department is also making arrangements for a series of regional seminars for local authority planners on the practical implementation of the guidelines. The seminars will provide practical advice on the implementation of the core provisions of the guidelines, including preparation of development plan policies, the provision of better support and advice to applicants, and more efficient and comprehensive consideration of planning applications.</P>
