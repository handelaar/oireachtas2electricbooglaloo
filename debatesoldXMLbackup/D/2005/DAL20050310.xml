    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the urgent need for Internet service providers to ban websites which purport to provide an opportunity for parents, pupils and other parties to rate the performances of teachers and the serious implications such websites could have for other professionals such as doctors, nurses, garda&iacute; and public service officials, who may be pilloried by having their professional reputations publicly compromised by disparaging comments from certain elements of the public.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the apparent lack of progress in repairing the roof of the national aquatic centre following the storm damage to its roof on 1 January last, the considerable inconvenience the closure of the centre has caused its 4,000 members and other users, including many elite swimmers, and the resultant cancellation of a number of international swimming competitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to discuss an important matter of public interest that requires urgent consideration, namely, the critical failure of the State to ensure the provision of an adequate child care infrastructure, the resultant exclusion of a large proportion of women from the workforce and the report of the forum on the workplace of the future, which stated that the cost of child care in the State is the highest in the EU.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to take No. 17, Finance Bill 2005 &mdash; Report Stage, resumed, and Final Stage; and No. 17<i>a</i>&mdash; statements on the Report on Certain Issues of Management and Administration in the Department of Health and Children associated with the practice of charges for persons in long-stay care in health board institutions and related matters.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted on the conclusion of oral questions to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which shall be taken for 75 minutes immediately on the conclusion of No. 17<i>a</i>; (2) the proceedings on the resumed Report Stage and Final Stage of No. 17 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in respect of amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; (3) No. 17<i>a</i> shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, adjourn after two hours and 15 minutes and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) Members shall be called upon in the following sequence and the statements in each case shall not exceed the times indicated: T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children &mdash; 15 minutes; Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; 15 minutes; Fine Gael &mdash; 15 minutes; Labour &mdash; 15 minutes; and Technical Group &mdash; 15 minutes; (ii) subject to (i), members may share time; and (iii) immediately following the statements, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall each take questions for a period not exceeding 30 minutes in each case; and (4) the D&aacute;il on its rising today shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 22 March 2005.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There are four proposals to put to the House. Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 17 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No. Although it is possible that the House will have completed its consideration of the amendments proposed to the Finance Bill by 1.30 p.m., the proposal to impose a guillotine is abhorrent to the Opposition, not only in respect of this Bill but in all instances. The debate on the Bill should be allowed to take its normal course. It is likely that we will have time to conclude our consideration of the amendments and a guillotine will not be needed. Nevertheless, the proposal to impose a guillotine on such an <Col N="891"/>important Bill is wrong in principle and I strongly object to it.</P>
      <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has proposed major new amendments to the Finance Bill. The proposed amendments to section 58 will significantly water down the penalties imposed on advisers, bankers and others who are involved in aiding and abetting tax evasion. The imposition of a guillotine on the Report Stage debate will deprive the House of an opportunity to discuss the amendments, which are shameful and disgraceful, especially in light of this country&rsquo;s series of tax evasion scandals, which have cost ordinary and decent taxpayers a great deal of money. The Government&rsquo;s guillotine will, in effect, preclude the possibility of a debate on the new amendments being introduced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Green Party opposes the proposal to impose a guillotine on the Report Stage debate on the Finance Bill. This is the third year in a row that amendments have been introduced to the Finance Bill on Report Stage without having been discussed on any previous Stage. Many amendments will not be debated because they will not be reached. The Report Stage debate is on amendment No. 13 of 61 amendments. We will not make much progress during the hour or so we will have to debate the remaining amendments. The Green Party opposes the guillotine on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question, &ldquo;That the proposal for dealing with No. 17 be agreed&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the proposal for dealing with No. 17<i>a</i> agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Before agreeing to this, I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste three questions. Given that no Minister of this Government is prepared to accept responsibility for this matter, is it intended to introduce amendments to the Public Service Management Act 1997, particularly to section 3, which sets out the political responsibilities of Ministers? Will the T&aacute;naiste explain to the House how a copy of a file which went missing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That might be more appropriate to the debate taking place at<?oasys _jy?>1.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Travers report, amounting to 160 pages, was produced but the file was not part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but there will be an opportunity for questions this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I can deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="892"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be more appropriate to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It would lead on to many questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfair to Members who might want to submit questions in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the T&aacute;naiste to respond to the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be another reason not to do it then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The inaction of the Minister in the knowledge that the payments in question were illegal has cost the taxpayer &euro;500 million.</P>
      <P>Is it intended, given what the T&aacute;naiste called systematic maladministration in the Department of Health and Children, that there will be disciplinary proceedings against any members of the public service who were involved in this matter? Alternatively, are we just to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has made his point. It would be more appropriate to the debate this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;a sideways movement of somebody to a job that was abolished some months ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unthinkable that we should embark upon a very inadequate and abridged debate, extracted under pressure from the Taoiseach and providing for contributions of only 15 minutes, on a matter of this significance. The T&aacute;naiste suggests that we should be further blindfolded by our not having the opportunity to read the contents of the missing file, a copy of which has now been discovered in the Department. Does she intend to have the contents of that file distributed to us?</P>
      <P>As with so many other matters in the realm of political accountability, it is unbelievable that such a file would not have been seen by a Minister with any kind of hands-on approach to his job. Mr. Kelly tells us it was observed in the outer office of the Minister. Will the T&aacute;naiste assure the House that we will have an opportunity to read the file concerned between now and the taking of the statements, such as they are, at 1.30 p.m.?</P>
      <P>While making this assurance she might also comment on Mr. Travers&rsquo;s comment, in page 54 of the report, that the documents she referred to the Attorney General were essentially the same documents that went missing earlier. This must mean Mr. Travers had seen them. I do not know why they do not form an appendix to the report. In any event, we cannot embark on statements on a matter with such grave ramifications for the taxpayer without our seeing the missing file. I presume the T&aacute;naiste will commit, as I believe the Taoiseach did eventually yesterday, to allowing a proper debate on the ramifications of <Col N="893"/>this matter as soon as this House resumes after its recess, or as early as possible thereafter. Such a debate would address the relationship between Ministers and civil servants, the conduct in respect of this matter, the implications for the taxpayer and the terms of any redress scheme the T&aacute;naiste proposes to introduce. The opportunity we have today very much represents an inadequate and abridged opportunity for statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the civil servant who negotiated the residential abuse settlement moved to the Higher Education Authority. Now Mr. Kelly has gone there. It seems to be some sort of purgatory for civil servants.</P>

	<P>That does not arise.</P>

	<P>I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The question I have is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it related to the business before us, which is the proposal for dealing with No. 17<i>a</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is. On the statements, I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Deputy satisfied with the arrangements for dealing with No. 17<i>a</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not because we need clarity on the legislative proposals that will flow from the conclusions of the Travers report. Clearly, the special relationship that has existed until now between civil servants and Ministers has been broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the debate which will take place in the afternoon. I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A tradition dating back to the enactment of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 has been broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do Ministers no longer accept responsibility for their Departments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That needs to be clarified now.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="894"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will have an opportunity in the debate this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It needs to be clarified before we begin the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste advise the House on whether she will circulate a detailed summary of the content of the missing file so that we will all be privy to exactly the same information as we commence what I would call a very inadequate opportunity for debate this afternoon? I note the time provision. Given that the Taoiseach only indicated the taking of statements yesterday, I welcome the introduction of a question and answer session involving the T&aacute;naiste and the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Nevertheless, the allocation of 30 minutes for questions and answers with each of them on this very complex and important matter is totally inadequate.</P>
      <P>Within that timeframe, how many Members of this House will have the opportunity to ask the Minister and former Minister serious, searching questions and listen to, note and carefully monitor their replies? We have witnessed repeated filibustering on the part of the Taoiseach. Will we have succinct and properly measured responses to all the questions posed and, more importantly, will the T&aacute;naiste allow further time for the question and answer section of the opportunity that presents itself this afternoon? This is the most important section of the debate, yet it will constitute only one hour of an opportunity lasting two hours and 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s questions will be shorter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is awake. He is welcome to the House. I believed he was only here in body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should conclude.</P>

	<P>Allow the T&aacute;naiste to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>As Deputy Rabbitte has acknowledged, Mr. Travers makes the point on page 54 of the report that the letter sent at my request in October was a copy of the letter in the file. I have it here and will circulate it. It is a copy which was held in the line division that prepared the submission for the Attorney General and prepared the letter. Mr. Travers refers to it in his report and he saw it. It was the same correspondence, the exact same copy. However, the file is still missing and I do not know where it is. That is why I established the Travers inquiry. I can certainly make copies available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>

    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I have asked the press office in the Department of Health and Children to ask for a correction to a story that was circulated this morning. I do not know the source of the story but it is not accurate.</P>
      <P>On the legal implications of the inquiry and whether there will be a need for amending legislation, that matter has not been considered. Legislation may not be required in that there are excellent recommendations on how Departments should operate and how the management team should operate and interface with Ministers. All Department officials and Ministers would do well to read and consider them because they are thoughtful and comprehensive.</P>
      <P>On the other issues, we will have a chance in this afternoon&rsquo;s debate both to make statements and deal with any questions that arise.</P>

	<P>I oppose this proposal which is unreasonable. We have just agreed that the provision made today to deal with the extraordinary situation that has emerged in terms of long-stay care is entirely inadequate as an abridged form of debate. There is absolutely no good reason why this House should not meet next week to have a proper debate that does justice to the Travers report and seeks to hold the Government, especially the former Minister for Health and Children, to account for the unbelievable position that he knew nothing of what was going on in his Department on this major issue. For that reason, I oppose the proposal to adjourn until 22 March, which is unreasonable in the circumstances.</P>

	<P>I was a little taken aback when Deputy Rabbitte said we have just agreed that the time provided is inadequate. Unfortunately, it appears from the record that only 11 of us were of that view.

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the business in hand and the fact that the Taoiseach will not be here for five weeks, it merits the prospect of the Taoiseach being able to attend again for a further day or days in the coming week in order to discuss this matter. Given that business will adjourn at the conclusion of the two hours and 15 minutes, we need to resume because the time provided is inadequate. The import and seriousness of what is to be addressed will not be satisfied in that time and there is a requirement that the matter, which is ongoing business until it is properly addressed and concluded, is taken up at the earliest opportunity. Regrettably, this can only be achieved in the coming week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Rabbitte on this matter. The T&aacute;naiste has already said she will not travel to America in order to deal with the ramifications of the Travers report next week. Perhaps the D&aacute;il should consider sitting tomorrow or next week to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I am amused by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who speaks about seeking extra time to deal with the matter. I understand the Sinn F&eacute;in Whip, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, did not attend the meeting yesterday.

	<P>When I heard Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in criticise the Taoiseach&rsquo;s absence, I was going to make the point Deputy Kenny made that his party did not attend the Whips&rsquo; meeting yesterday when arrangements were being made to discuss the Travers report. I commend the parties who attended, reached an agreement and honoured that in the House this morning. It is much more sincere than being absent, then calling for a vote and wasting time.</P>

	<P>Deputies will be aware that for many years it has been the tradition that many Ministers, Ministers of State and the Taoiseach visit the Irish diaspora, as the former President, Mary Robinson, referred to them, and attend various events where Irish people are proud to celebrate our national holiday. It is true that I am not travelling. I would be gone by now if I were travelling to San Francisco. As there are huge issues for the Department of Health and Children, it is my duty to be in the Department tomorrow, and on Monday and Tuesday of next week to deal with them and work with the management team to deliver change and bring about a new situation in the future. For all these <Col N="900"/>reasons, I do not agree with the<?oasys _jy?>Deputies.</P>
      <P>The report is before the Joint Committee on Health and Children. I am sure the committee will spend considerable time discussing and considering the Travers report. It is the appropriate forum to deal with the matter. I have no doubt there should be further debates in this House on the implications of the Travers report. It is reasonable and proper that the D&aacute;il should adjourn next week to facilitate Government representatives honouring commitments overseas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that the Finance Bill is going through its concluding stages, will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that a Supplementary Estimate will be introduced later this year to deal with the consequences of the procedure to make payments for the public patients problem and that there will not be any diminution of services as a result?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated recently that it might be necessary, arising from this, to set up an all-party committee to look at other Departments and examine if the processes they are following might also require legal implementation in the same way a legal basis is required for charges for persons in public institutions. Will that be the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>A Supplementary Estimate will be necessary later this year; we have already made that clear. I do not know about an all-party committee but the Cabinet sub-committee, made up of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Attorney General and myself, has reflected on whether there are other areas of Government where regulations may not be on a sound footing. In December, I asked the assistant secretary with responsibility for finance for an audit in my Department and we may need some legal expertise to ensure that what has emerged in this instance could not happen in any other area of public administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste should remember to bring the file if she is looking for legal advice. Will we have the letter as soon as possible so we can look at it before we start the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Is this the letter that does exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. It is a mystery that the file does not exist. I agree with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>It was the previous letter that did not exist that was rocking the foundations of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a delicate matter. I note that the late John Boland prepared proposals to address this issue in 1987. What, then, is the procedure here? Does the Ceann Comhairle have any intention of vacating the Chair so he can address the House on why this was stopped in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise at this stage. The Deputy may raise the matter during the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If John Boland&rsquo;s proposals had been enacted, they would have saved the taxpayer most of the &euro;2 billion bill we now face but they were stopped by the subsequent Minister for Health who was, with respect, the Ceann Comhairle himself.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="902"/>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I am merely asking for the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s guidance at this stage on procedure. Is there any precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is a problem, the Deputy can come to the office of the Ceann Comhairle and we can discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to go the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office. I want to know if there is a precedent for the Ceann Comhairle vacating the Chair to address the House on a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not arise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste said earlier she was not sure if legislation was required to amend section 3 of the Public Service Management Act 1997. When will she be in a position to let the House know if such legislation is required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe legislation is required, as I said earlier. That is my view and nobody has drawn to my attention any area where legislation would be required.</P>

	<P>Ministerial responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>The T&aacute;naiste</NameTxt>
	<P>There are two areas of responsibility. Of course Ministers are responsible to this House, as they hold constitutional office. Secretary Generals are accounting officers and they are accountable for public moneys. There are different areas of accountability in this whole matter and they are clear. There is no doubt about that. I am quite certain we will deal with these issues when we return to the debate this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the T&aacute;naiste seek the advice of the Attorney General? Will somebody write the letter or what will happen?</P>

	<P>Substantial work is under way in that area and I hope to have the heads of the legislation with the Government later this year. I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern about many Irish graduates who could not get places in pharmacy schools here and had to go abroad. They are not in a position to own their own pharmacy and the position is unsatisfactory.</P>

I ask the T&aacute;naiste and the Ministers who are travelling to America next week to lobby for our Irish illegals who are suffering in America due to the new regulations. I ask the Ministers who will meet congressmen etc. in the US next week, when the parties are taking place, to lobby for our Irish illegals given that they are in the same positions as those with permits here.</P>

	<P>The work permits Bill will be published shortly and is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 12:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 13, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall review tax relief arrangements for private nursing homes to determine their compatibility with health criteria and in particular health and welfare related criteria regarding the size and location of facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right" el="0">&mdash;(Deputy Burton).<?oasys _is0p10-?></P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand I am replying to the Minister. Will the Minister undertake in the context of the tax breaks under various headings that his Department will review the compatibility of the wide range of tax breaks for health care and nursing homes and if they link in any way to general health and welfare policy, particularly in regard to older people? I gave the Minister examples yesterday of nursing homes which are springing up in various parts of the country, some of which are good, but some are in remote locations where older people will have no chance of independent living or ever getting out because they are in rural areas with no footpaths, no access to a church, shops or the pub. Will the Minister for Finance specifically undertake to have that examined in the context of the review of tax breaks?</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister saw the reports in the media last week which were fairly extensive of plans by a number of international care groups to establish in Ireland facilities for older people. They spoke about some of the sheltered housing which will be available for purchase by what was described as older &ldquo;high rollers&rdquo;, and that the cost of each of these units of accommodation would be &euro;1 million. In that context the tax break cost to the Minister&rsquo;s Department will be approximately &euro;420,000 because these high rollers will surely have exposure to the 42% rate of tax. All I am asking for is the facts and, as with the Travers report, that we have some attempt to logically examine the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the OECD report today Ireland has one of the narrowest tax bases. We know the infrastructure is in shambles and that people spend hours commuting. Every other European city has public transport of a high quality to most areas of its city. We have had to wait seven years for the opening of the two Luas lines. The shambles in public infrastructure is unbelievable. Are we going to give very attractive tax breaks to wealthy older people to the tune of approximately &euro;500,000 each, while at the same time ordinary people who have worked all their lives and paid their taxes are unable to get any kind of public provision for sheltered housing? It is a simple question and we debated some of it yesterday. Who benefits? If the Minister decides to continue the tax break, the Labour Party wants the benefit to be spread widely throughout the community <Col N="906"/>rather than it being exclusively available to older people who can purchase &euro;1 million euro apartments and probably pay, from the standards that were being talked about, &euro;1,000 a week in additional care costs on top of that. There may well be a market demand for this level of facility in this country and that is fine. However, it should not be tax subsidised when those who have worked hard all their lives are forced to rely on a degree of public provision while well-off people get all the tax breaks and benefits of the tax expenditure foregone. It is a question of justice and equity that the needs of all our older citizens should be considered in a rounded way. If State subvention or subsidies are there for the giving, they should be spread equitably among the community. As is the case with most tax breaks they should not simply go to very wealthy people who can afford legal, accounting and other expensive advice and can afford to buy into tax avoidance schemes. If this is the only outcome of tax incentivisation of the private health sector, it is very unfair. I want the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that if he cannot accept this amendment that this will be one of the key and critical elements of the review he has promised.</P>
      <P>There are no figures available about the number of nursing homes or sheltered accommodation which benefit from these tax breaks because the Minister has said his Department keeps no figures. I cannot get any information from the Department of Health and Children, which does not seem to know what it is doing most of the time. Although traditionally in public administration the Department of Finance had a line management role in vetting the expenditure and policies of other Departments, when it comes to tax breaks the Department of Finance seems to have completely abdicated its role. Never mind the missing file today, there does not even seem to be a letter from the Department of Finance to the Department of Health and Children setting out what these various tax breaks are supposed to do, and the implications for health, welfare and social care policies. I ask the Minister to give the House an undertaking on this study. He did not establish a proper independent commission on taxation but is hiring his own consultants. The House should be given a guarantee that this will be a decent study and not simply a set-up to facilitate the high rollers yet again for another decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;4.&mdash;An approved body pursuant to section 848A of the Principal Act shall make available to the public sufficient particulars of its accounts and such other information as may be required by the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P><Col N="907"/>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to require that charities which benefit from the range of tax breaks now available in respect of charitable donations should be at a minimum required to file and publish accounting information so donors and people who are meant to be the recipients of this charitable giving and the general public can have an idea of how this tax break is being utilised.</P>
      <P>In the course of Committee Stage, the Minister stated there has been a considerable extension of the take-up of tax relief in respect of charitable donations. I think he said it is estimated to have cost &euro;21 million in tax breaks in the most recent year for which he has figures. If one assumes the rate of relief is 42% for a considerable amount of the donations, this implies the donors are giving approximately &euro;50 million on which tax relief is subsequently being claimed. It should be borne in mind that there are many people who continuously give to charities and do not claim tax relief. It is therefore a confined number of donors who are taking advantage of the very generous exemptions relating to charitable donations which the former Minister, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, introduced.</P>
      <P>When I spoke to the former Minister about this, he referred to the scheme introduced by Deputy Quinn when he was Minister for Finance in commemoration of the Famine and which was specifically intended to assist in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. While Deputy McCreevy thought this scheme was good, he decided to expand it. He explained to me that he decided to expand it on foot of his experience of visiting the United States where charitable foundations and charitable giving are very much an established way of life. It is important to note that in the United States there is quite an amount of very detailed regulation at federal and at state level regarding charitable giving. There is a requirement on charitable foundations and trusts to publish accounts and to make accounting information available.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, almost all large charities which deal with the Third World or which assist people with a disability are limited companies and therefore are required to produce accounts in accordance with company law. There are significant numbers of registered charities and also significant numbers of religious bodies which are also charities which do not file or publish any form of detailed accounting information. Although the taxpayer gave tax rebates of &euro;21 million in recent years, we have no idea who the beneficiaries are and the use to which the donations were put. I support tax breaks for charitable giving but because there is no charity law in Ireland, I am fearful that it is capable of being abused. I say that because like many Members I have experience of working with many charitable organisations over the years. When scandals occasionally arise in the Irish charity sector they are deeply damaging to the very good work done by the <Col N="908"/>reputable charity organisations which are widespread in this country.</P>
      <P>Because public provision is so small, we need charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to address the level of need in society. Ireland is the second richest country in Europe and yet there is a great need for charitable organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to deal with people who are poor. Charitable organisations are desperately required in the field of disability because State services are so inadequate. The country needs good operating charitable not-for-profit organisations providing a range of services because public provision is so small.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the introduction of a charity bill is being treated like a football. I worked on it when I was in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The heads of the Bill were ready when I left Government. It then travelled around the Departments and is currently resting with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who has promised that there will be legislation to govern charities some time soon. A full consultation process was completed and signed off in my time.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to insert a requirement in the Finance Bill that those charities which benefit from the tax regime available to charities and charitable giving must produce financial accounts to show where the money comes from and where it goes to. It is very easy for the Minister to obtain advice. If, in the Minister&rsquo;s view, this would be too onerous on small charities, he could easily provide that they be required to file a donation statement, that is, a list of donations received and details on how they were expended, while requiring large charities to produce the standard type of accounts stipulated under the Companies Acts. It is easy to be flexible and we want a minimum of bureaucracy. We do not want to hinder those who wish to hold collections for particular events. We already have a model.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the public has been left in the dark as to which charities are the beneficiaries of the tax break in question, which is valued at &euro;21 million. If this information were published and the public could see who are the beneficiaries, it could encourage small charities to ensure donations they receive are tax efficient. Currently, the tax break tends to be the preserve of larger charities and not-for-profit organisations with a direct knowledge of this field, possibly because they have accountants or tax specialists on their boards or have designed their structures specifically to take advantage of the tax breaks. The Labour Party position is reasonable and it is unbelievable that the Government is unwilling to inform the public who are the beneficiaries of tax breaks.</P>
      <P>Concern and Tr&oacute;caire, because they are companies, provide good information in their accounts which allows one to identify what benefits they receive from the Government&rsquo;s tax regime. We have no idea, however, which of the <Col N="909"/>6,500 charities, some large and some small, benefit from the &euro;21 million tax break. It is reasonable on the grounds of public accountability that this information be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton has made a worthwhile proposal and it should be acted upon in the interests of accountability. What is the uptake by schools of the tax break in question? Unfortunately, they have not sufficiently tapped into the facility by which highly tax efficient subscriptions can be made to local schools. Perhaps highlighting it will encourage members of the public to avail of it. If an individual paying tax at the 42% rate subscribes &euro;290 to his or her local school, Revenue will provide a further &euro;210, bringing the contribution to &euro;500. Does the Minister have details on the uptake of this under-used facility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposition. What is envisaged here can be turned into a positive for the charitable organisations and donors and all Deputies should commend the amendment. Greater availability of information is another element which could be added to the list of tax credits people can claim, which I recounted yesterday. More information in this regard would be of benefit to all of us. The requirement, as proposed, regarding the provision of sufficient particulars regarding the accounts of charitable bodies is appropriate and should be facilitated. I await the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton and others tabled similar amendments on Committee Stage and I am glad to reiterate the response I gave then. As Deputies are aware, section 848A provides for the scheme of income tax and corporation tax relief for donations to approved bodies, which include eligible charities, first and second level schools, as Deputy Paul McGrath noted, third level institutions, including universities, as well as other named bodies. Slightly more than 6,400 bodies currently hold the tax exemption as charitable bodies, of which 1,660 qualify as eligible charities for the purposes of the donations relief.</P>
      <P>With regard to charities, the Revenue Commissioners impose a strict set of conditions on bodies duly granted tax exemption as charities. These include keeping a satisfactory financial record which must be available for inspection by Revenue, establishing proper controls where funds are raised by public subscription and submitting to Revenue the first year&rsquo;s financial accounts within 18 months of exemption being granted. A clear and transparent regulatory system is, therefore, in place to ensure the financial records are in keeping with proper methods and donations are being used for the purposes for which they are raised. In addition, given that failure to satisfy these conditions can and does result in the exemption being withdrawn, the regulatory framework is not <i>pro forma </i>but has teeth.</P><Col N="910"/>
      <P>More than three quarters of charities and most approved bodies, apart from schools, are established as companies and, consequently, already have a statutory obligation under company law to lodge annual accounts with the Companies Office.</P>
      <P>Under donations relief approved bodies receive a substantial tax benefit from the Exchequer. For this reason, it is necessary to have public confidence in the way such bodies operate, in particular in how their funds are applied. There is no divergence of opinion among Deputies on this principle, although we disagree on how public confidence can be best achieved. As I explained, however, the current framework is in large measure effective.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs recently concluded a public consultation process on the establishment of a modern statutory framework for charities. Unfortunately, a lengthy incubation is part of the nature of the legislative process. Nevertheless, the process is under way and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, will shortly bring to Cabinet a series of legislative proposals regarding a charities regulatory regime. I fully expect that these proposals will set out a framework of accountability and transparency in terms of the activities of charities and compliance and governance generally. Modernising charities legislation, providing for greater accountability and transparency and ensuring compliance and governance will be at the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s policy response.</P>
      <P>Legislation is the proper forum in which to establish an appropriate system of public accountability. Rather than using the Finance Bill in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion, let the modern charities legislation due for imminent consideration by the Cabinet be the means by which we address some of the issues raised in the amendment.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage last week I provided for a reduction from three to two years in the waiting period for obtaining tax exemption for donations. This Bill assists this by reducing the time for which new charities can seek relief exemption on donations. The wider policy issues raised will be dealt with in the context of the modern charities legislation. Further changes would be premature given the work done by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and his Department and the current stage of those legislative proposals. For this reason, I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton referred to the scheme of donations introduced in the Finance Act 1995 by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn. The scheme only related to the activities of charities in the Third World. Relief for personal donations to such charities was at the standard rate of income tax. There was a <i>de minimis</i> qualifying amount of £200, or &euro;254, and an annual upper limit of £750, or &euro;952, by any individual donor under the scheme.</P><Col N="911"/>
      <P>The scheme for donations introduced by my immediate predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, in the Finance Act 2001 merged nearly all of the existing donation schemes into a single, simplified and extended one. For the first time, personal donations to domestic charities qualified for relief under the scheme. The relief, which is generous, is granted at the taxpayer&rsquo;s marginal rate of income tax. While there is a <i>de minimis</i> qualifying amount of &euro;250, there is no upper limit on the amount that can be donated. As Deputy Paul McGrath pointed out, the relief is also available to second level schools, universities and other third level educational establishments.</P>
      <P>I do not have the details the Deputy seeks but I will speak to the Revenue Commissioners about obtaining it. The figure of &euro;21 million I gave is in respect of this extended scheme, incorporating the many other schemes from the past and its wider application to educational institutions. I would be only speculating on the figure without further information. On a previous amendment, Members spoke about keeping tax forms simple to ensure people know their entitlements. If a question in respect of everything was put on tax forms for the purposes of collating figures, it would be very long and may not serve its purpose. We will do what we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The specific form for schools and the like could be used by Revenue to collate that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will check this. I am only speculating on the figure. The &euro;21 million relates to PAYE donations which were claimed by charities as refunds from the Revenue Commissioners in 2003. The cost of donations by self-employed earners in 2002 will become available later this year, giving additional information. No breakdown will be available on figures between charities and schools because of how the form is structured. In the case of the PAYE sector, it is the charity or the approved body that claims the relief rather than the taxpayer, allowing us to identify what each charity receives. However, for the self-employed sector, information will only be collected on the amounts donated and not on the charities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance, he proceeded with caution in this area because of the legitimate fear that, with the absence of charity legislation, it could be open to abuse. This fear remains. Members are aware of and support the fantastic work done by not-for-profit organisations in a range of activities. However, it is only right to ask about the benefits to charitable organisations under the scheme, and to which charitable organisations those in the self-employed category are donating.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, there have been limited scandals involving charities. However, when they have <Col N="912"/>occurred they usually concerned inconsistencies between the charity&rsquo;s objectives and actual spending. In some cases, management and administrative costs have been excessively high. With no accountability, the system is at risk of people who are expert at using tax breaks benefiting themselves and moneys being abused and removed from their original intentions.</P>
      <P>Due to the confidentiality clause between individual taxpayers, charities and the Revenue Commissioners, no information on the reliefs is available. While the figure for the PAYE sector was &euro;21 million, I have been informed the figure for the self-employed sector is significant. Public accountability is important in this area. I hope the Minister will keep it under review since the successful operation of the charities sector is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add. I do not want to delay the proceedings because I would love to get to amendment No. 58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>As amendments Nos. 14 and 16 are related, they will be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;4.&mdash;Where a person avails of tax relief relating to income including or consisting of rental income pursuant to the Principal Act, he or she shall furnish to the Commissioners sufficient information to demonstrate that he or she has complied with any requirement of the law regarding registration as a landlord.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">The purpose of these amendments is to provide a degree of accountability and transparency in tax relief schemes, who benefits from them and what is involved. We are legitimately entitled to know if tax breaks are justified and equitable to the broader public interest. This amendment concerns tax relief on rental income for landlords. There is widespread concern that some landlords and property owners, availing of such tax breaks, are not in compliance with registration requirements with the residential tenancies board or local authorities.</P>
      <P>Landlords renting to private tenants is a fraught area. The Government has moved away from investing in social housing. The burden of this has fallen on the private rental sector, supported by rent allowances paid by community welfare officers and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. However, there is no knowledge of how many landlords are tax compliant or registered with the residential tenancies boards. This simple amendment will close this loop, requiring landlords availing of this tax relief to be properly registered and in compliance with other legal requirements. They are asked to register with the <Col N="913"/>board &mdash; formerly with local authorities &mdash; to try to ensure issues such as a fair deal for the tenant quality accommodation and that basic fire and safety regulations are dealt with. If landlords operate in residential areas, they must have some sense of social responsibility to the wider community in respect of simple things such as the property being maintained and painted and the area around the property being cleaned regularly so it does not become a nuisance.</P>
      <P>Average rents here are very high as is the average subsidy paid by community welfare officers in respect of rental properties. This costs the State a packet. On the one hand, we subsidise tax breaks for people investing in property and becoming landlords and on the other, we pay many of them rent through the community welfare officer schemes. The State is paying on the double through tax breaks and rent subsidy.</P>
      <P>This is an entirely reasonable amendment that would bring some level of assurance to compliant taxpayers who do not usually take advantage of tax breaks that these landlords comply with registration requirements. The Minister should adopt a reasonable approach so this type of issue is sorted out.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>My amendment No. 16 is related to amendment No. 14. We are seeking the proper and full enforcement of the terms of the Private Residential Tenancies Act 2004. We must take note of the statement of the Irish Property Owners Association that there is not only an intention, but a practice of passing on the cost of registering with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, to tenants as a further element in the overall rental demand. This is an outrageous act on the part of people in that sector who literally heap any and every responsibility on the unfortunate tenants.</P>
      <P>This is against the backdrop where, I understand, it is &ldquo;guesstimated&rdquo; that there are up to 120,000 landlords who are obliged under the terms of the PRTB to register by the 1 December 2004 deadline, but who have not done so. The figure might be much greater. This clearly indicates there are major matters to be addressed.</P>
      <P>There is a requirement on the Government to consider what measures might be taken at this time in order that these serious matters are properly addressed, that is, matters one would have to see in the context of undermining the Private Residential Tenancies Act 2004. If there is not compliance and if the registration cost is being dumped on tenants, with the landlords bearing none of the cost, that was not the intention of the introduction of the PRTB and the requirement to register by the deadline some three months past. All these matters must be addressed.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that all the links are established, that is, in terms of tax relief relating to income, including where mortgage interest relief is sought in respect of a second property other than the registered home and place of residence. <Col N="914"/>There is a responsibility on Revenue to check the status of a property in terms of its use, that is, whether it is for owner-family use, which is exempt from registration under the terms of the PRTB, or whether it is rented out under private sector arrangements. If it is the latter, in the absence of any admission, there clearly is a breach to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burton referred to other very important issues in regard to the upkeep and management of homes in the rental sector. Property speculators and those taking up the role of landlord have been concentrating in the main on housing schemes, particularly in rural towns, targeting homes in what would be traditionally viewed as the more affordable bracket &mdash; perhaps former council housing schemes that have been in private ownership for some years. The houses go on the market when families grow up or move on. Whatever the case, there is a change in the configuration of major housing schemes. Investors are targetting these properties and putting them outside the reach of young couples and young families looking for a home or a starter home, whatever their circumstances. They are literally being priced out of the market. If these properties are not maintained, they become a major eyesore, very much take away from the sterling efforts of home owners in the same catchment area and debase the quality of life people living there. It is an important area that needs to be factored in.</P>
      <P>The focus of this Bill is financial but there is also the social element of all this, which cannot be erased from our consideration. It must be taken on board and I am pleased Deputy Burton referred to it also. I have raised it in the past and it is an issue that needs to be tackled head on. Property owners, whether home owner occupiers or those who operate a rental arrangement have a responsibility not only to their tenants, but to their neighbours and the community. Sadly, this is often not honoured. I commend both amendments to the Minister and I hope the critical arguments presented will find a sympathetic response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. There are more ways to deal with this issue than to always use private enterprise. This is about ensuring the taxpayer gets value for money because, after all, this tax would otherwise be available to the Exchequer to be spent on things that need to be done. In the context of this amendment and the previous two, there is a need to ensure that anybody getting tax relief for charitable donations or providing accommodation gives value to the State. These amendments are a way forward.</P>
      <P>It is one way of doing it, but would it not make more sense to direct tax reliefs towards Government policy? It is Government policy to support older people at home. It was referred to this morning. It is mentioned in the review document and in the health strategy. However, the practical application of the tax laws means that people are <Col N="915"/>not encouraged to stay in their own homes or, when they can no longer stay in their own homes, to stay in their community. The Finance Act provides one way of ensuring that money is directed towards communities to allow them provide a local alternative which offers much better value for money. Even if it cost twice as much, it would be worth it because that is what people want.</P>
      <P>Communities that support sheltered housing need support. A defined revenue funded scheme and a co-ordinated approach by the Department of Finance and other Departments are required to ensure that finance is available so that voluntary housing associations, of which there are several hundred, are able to employ sufficient staff to support people for longer in their own homes and also in sheltered housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister might also consider introducing an alternative to the profit driven non-community nursing homes, which are essential when there is no community alternative and no public alternative. The Minister should replace the policy of supporting private enterprise by enacting Government policy and introducing a scheme to ensure that tax breaks are directed towards communities. There are hundreds of voluntary housing associations with charitable status who would be prepared to take on more sheltered housing. This would solve the problems of older people by enabling them to stay in their own homes and, when they can no longer do so, by enabling them to stay in the community. The voluntary housing associations could take on the higher support that is equivalent to nursing home care. However, for that to happen we need to make changes in legislation and in the circulars to allow capital assistance funds to be used for that purpose through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Changes would also have to be made to allow communities to draw down subventions in the same way as nursing homes can.</P>
      <P>These changes could be made with a stroke of the pen. They would make a major difference to people. At the moment the budget for social housing is not sufficient to realise what the Government has set down as the essential targets. A change of emphasis is needed. I admire the Minister for Finance as a man who is capable of deciding what he wants to do. I appeal to him to examine the community alternative for supporting older people at home. I support this motion which looks for value for money for the taxpayer. More needs to be done regarding the community alternative than merely paying lip-service to it. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children paid much lip-service to it in the D&aacute;il the other day but the current state of affairs continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with amendments Nos. 14 and 16 together. These amendments propose to insert a new section 4 into the Bill and to make it a general condition of claiming tax relief <Col N="916"/>on rental income that the person involved provides evidence to the Revenue Commissioners that he or she has registered as a landlord where this is required by law. Part 7 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 contains requirements for landlords regarding registration of tenancies. These requirements relate to residential tenancies of dwellings, to which I assume the amendment relates.</P>
      <P>Apart from tax relief being available for normal letting expenses, it is also available for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment, conversion or purchase of a house for rented residential purposes in areas designated under one of the tax incentive schemes, such as the urban or rural renewal schemes. In addition tax relief is also available for interest arising on borrowings used for the purchase, improvement or repair of rented residential accommodation.</P>
      <P>I said on Committee Stage when this amendment was first proposed that I would consider this matter between then and Report Stage. My officials and officials from the Revenue Commissioners have since met officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to discuss the matter. The Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provided for the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board as an independent body with a range of specific statutory functions, including responsibility for the administration of tenancy registration and dispute resolution. I understand the board is processing a large volume of applications for registration from which a statutory tenancy register will be compiled. Until this work is completed, it will not be possible for the board to provide comprehensive data. When the statutory tenancy register is completed, it will enable the board to provide a range of enhanced information relating to the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>Various issues on linking registration to eligibility for tax incentives have been raised previously. However, it has not been possible to bring forward measures for Report Stage to deal comprehensively with these intricacies. My officials and officials from the Revenue Commissioners will continue to discuss this matter with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Private Residential Tenancies Board to examine the possibilities for proposals in this area for future budgetary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that reply. I do not know whether Deputy Cowley heard yesterday but in the discussion on private nursing homes, the work he has done in Mulranny was mentioned. It is an example of the type of development we should aspire to so that older people can stay in the community and have supported housing.</P>
      <P>On Mothers&rsquo; Day last Sunday, my daughter, as a surprise gift to me, took me out to the new shopping centre at Balally in Dundrum. I went along because I had no option but to accept the <Col N="917"/>gift. We went there on the Luas. Dundrum is a very affluent part of south Dublin, as the Minister is aware. When we got to the Luas station at Balally, I was surprised to see hanging all over the apartments being built there banners advertising tax breaks for investors who invest in these apartments. What is the necessity for a tax break for an investor purchasing an apartment in the Dundrum area directly over a Luas stop and beside one of the best shopping centres in Ireland?</P>
      <P>The Minister should contrast that with the case we have been making for the need to provide incentives for social housing for older people and people on the housing list. The new shopping centre is lovely. I was delighted to be there with the tens of thousands of other people who were also brought there for Mothers&rsquo; Day. However, we must ask ourselves what has gone wrong when we provide tax breaks at the marginal rate of 42% with no further requirement to check anything out. If the Minister gets the opportunity, he should go and see these banners hung over the apartments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will probably have to wait until Fathers&rsquo; Day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a unique opportunity and I am sure the Minister will enjoy Fathers&rsquo; Day with his children. I certainly enjoyed Mothers&rsquo; Day, but I could not get over the sight of these banners hung over the apartments around the Balally Luas station. The Luas station is tremendously popular and successful, as we knew it would be. This lovely shopping centre is directly across the road, and there are banners advertising tax breaks.</P>
      <P>The people about whom Deputy Cowley and I are talking are driven into the private rented sector, very often with little security of accommodation. I dealt with a lady who had returned home approximately a year ago to retire and be near family having worked as a nurse in England up to the age of 66. As she had lived in hospital accommodation in the UK she never bought a place of her own. She has now returned to terribly expensive Ireland and is living in a converted garage or outhouse, for lack of a better word, which was the only accommodation she could find. While the landlord is very nice, the building is not of appropriate standard. I am helping her, as I am sure others are, to make an application to the local authorities in the Dublin area. However, I know the answer. This woman emigrated and gave years of service working in the UK. She lived in subsidised housing and has now exercised her right to come home to her own country. While she can get no benefit, the investor in Dundrum is being offered 42% marginal tax relief, which indicates something is wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken very convincingly about his sense of equity and fairness, which I accept. I accept his approach is different from that of his predecessor, Mr. McCreevy, with whom I had a very good relationship over many <Col N="918"/>years even though our political approach was quite different. Mr. McCreevy told me he would turn the upper Shannon area into the Klondike for investors in housing, which he did, but what is the point of doing that if our elderly people and those in desperate need of housing get none of this benefit?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for taking on board the salient points made. I again ask him to explore the potential for including social responsibility. If it cannot come under his direct ambit, he might reflect it with one of his Cabinet colleagues so that the social responsibility of those in the private rental sector is reflected in legislation. It is absolutely essential to do so and I commend it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the principal problems with making registration a requirement for tax relief is that often no straightforward overlap exists between persons claiming tax relief and persons requiring to register. Some claimants of tax relief would have no requirement to register. Therefore, inclusion of a condition for tax relief requiring registration in those circumstances without further detailed consideration might make it very difficult to enforce effectively. The Private Residential Tenancies Board has worked hard to enable it to complete the registration process. In the past there were a considerable backlog and non-registration. Let us see the data before determining how to act to meet the basic sentiments expressed, including a way that would be legislatively effective and enforceable. We do not want to create difficulties that might not be evident immediately. Upon detailed discussion among officials in various Departments and with the Revenue Commissioners certain issues, intricacies and complexities can arise. We will see how we can progress those discussions with a view to consideration for budgetary consideration next time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;6.&mdash;As respects the year of assessment 2005 and subsequent years of assessment section 473 of the Principal Act is amended by substituting&mdash;&mdash;</P><Col N="919"/>
      <P LI="3">(<i>a</i>) &lsquo;&euro;5,080&rsquo; for &lsquo;&euro;2,540&rsquo;,</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) &lsquo;&euro;10,160&rsquo; for &lsquo;&euro;5,080&rsquo;, and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>c</i>) &lsquo;&euro;2,540&rsquo; for &lsquo;&euro;1,270&rsquo;,</P>
      <P LI="2" FLI="0">wherever same shall occur.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment also relates to private rented accommodation and takes the opposite approach. I seek the increase in the tax credits available to persons who are in private rented accommodation. The thresholds for tax relief for rented property are very low. The base rate is &euro;1,270 per annum, which is very small when considered on a weekly basis. It is not a real incentive to tenants in private rented accommodation to avail of tax relief. The Revenue Commissioners estimate that approximately 40,000 properties are covered by way of seeking tax relief on private rented accommodation. The CSO indicates that in excess of 80,000 private rented accommodations exist in the country. Deputy Burton said the Private Residential Tenancies Board indicated the figure could be as high as 120,000.</P>
      <P>The net effect is that many people in rented accommodation are not claiming their tax credits. If it were worthwhile for them to do so, they would do so. Having claimed them, the landlords would then be brought into the loop in terms of the Exchequer getting a clawback on the tax on the profits they make. I believe this provision would be self-funding. By defining the right level of tax credit for persons in private rented accommodation, it would have the net effect of bringing into the tax net considerably more landlords, who pay no tax on their rental income. I recently came across a person who owns 65 private rented dwellings in a provincial town. To keep track of all those properties alone would be phenomenal. I wonder whether all those properties are registered for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>If the Minister approaches the matter from the point of view of the tenants and give them reasonable tax breaks on paying their rent, they will want to claim their tax relief with the knock-on effect of being a bonus for the Exchequer. Yesterday the Minister spoke about low rates of tax that generate more activity. Increasing the benefit to the tenant as I have outlined would result in more registrations and more money into the coffers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment is well worth examining. We have given the tax breaks to the construction side of the rental sector. I could have understood the argument ten years ago when the construction sector was relatively depressed, but now that sector is roaring ahead. We must ask who the breaks benefit. Like Deputy McGrath, I have met many of these relatively young landlords, who have used tax incentives to get their first property and have used it to piggyback a series of further investments. In my constituency I know several young aggressive landlords who are busy trying to convert the houses they purchased <Col N="920"/>into multiple separate units. The local authorities have had many problems with them and with the standard of care and maintenance they provide in many cases. Problems often exist with tenants making noise etc.</P>
      <P>This is a new phenomenon. Many European countries have a long tradition of people investing in property and being landlords but doing so in a socially responsible manner by upholding obligations to local authorities and community residents. In Ireland, by contrast, we have had a strong tradition until recently of owner-occupation. However, given that we now have a tax-supported private rented sector which is expanding at phenomenal speed in every housing estate, there is a strong argument to redress the balance in favour of the tenant and local authority and to oblige landlords to conduct themselves in an appropriate and fair manner <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the community in which they operate and the local authority which provides services in that area.</P>
      <P>In many cases, the behaviour of landlords contributes heavily to the burden on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of tackling anti-social behaviour. In European countries such as Italy, France and Spain, where the private rented sector has a long history, one can visit a block of apartments or a housing estate and be unable to differentiate between private rented property and that occupied by the owner. Any Member of this House could visit a local authority or private estate and be able to guess with near certainty as to whether each property is occupied by the home owner or is rented. Rented properties are often notable for the uncut grass, poor appearance, shabby paintwork and dirt and litter in the front garden. As I am sure the Minister is aware, anybody who has been canvassing in Kildare could immediately tell which properties are rented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is director of elections for Fianna F&aacute;il. We shall soon see whether he has delivered the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>In most European countries people have been renting for generations. I was brought up in a rented house in the centre of Dublin city. Most people in that area, which consisted of traditional, working class housing, now own their homes but that was not the case at that time. However, landlords are now buying all the properties in this area and one can immediately tell which homes are let. I am not sure if this phenomenon is so apparent in provincial towns but Dublin is leading the way in this regard.</P>
      <P>This is a significant social phenomenon and because there has not been enough analysis of the structure of tax breaks for landlords and developments in this regard in the last seven or eight years, we are creating unnecessary social problems. We need a private rented sector that is well regulated. Perhaps in future canvassers can walk down roads without being able to identify those homes which are rented. Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s <Col N="921"/>amendment serves to redress the balance in favour of empowering responsible private tenants and it is worthy of the Minister&rsquo;s detailed consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment relates to section 473 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which grants relief for rent paid by individuals in respect of private rented accommodation. The level of rent qualifying for relief is dependent on a person&rsquo;s age and marital status. The Bill proposes to increase the limits on which rent relief can be claimed. For those under 55, the limit is increased from &euro;1,270 to &euro;1,500 for single persons and from &euro;2,540 to &euro;3,000 for married and widowed persons. For those over 55, the limit is increased from &euro;2,540 to &euro;3,000 for single persons and from &euro;5,080 to &euro;6,000 for married and widowed persons. Relief is granted at the standard rate of income tax, 20%. The cost of Deputy McGrath&rsquo;s amendment is estimated to be &euro;21.6 million in a full year, in addition to the full-year cost of &euro;5.2 million for the changes already provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>During the debate on Committee Stage, Deputy Bruton indicated the purpose of the amendment was to ensure equity of relief between mortgage interest relief and tax relief on rents. Mortgage interest relief is not differentiated on age grounds but between new, up to seven years, and old mortgages. The rates are &euro;8,000 for a married couple and &euro;4,000 for a single person in respect of a new mortgage, and &euro;5,080 for a married couple and &euro;2,540 for a single person in respect of old mortgages.</P>
      <P>Rather than introducing equity to the tax reliefs on rents, the amendment could arguably introduce bias towards those aged 55 and over as compared with first-time house purchasers. The amounts of the reliefs are different but the principle behind both is to concentrate on those most in need of them, that is, first-time buyers and elderly tenants. While I have increased the rent relief this year, I have not altered mortgage interest relief. However, as is normal practice in regard to all tax reliefs in the context of the annual budget, limits for both mortgage interest and rent reliefs are kept under review. Over the coming years, I will consider the extent to which it is desirable to have a closer alignment between the two reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will consider it opportune this year to examine the entire relief system, particularly in view of the establishment of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. This will provide the Minister with better information on the situation in this regard. Information on landlord registrations will allow the Minister to co-operate with the Revenue Commissioners in ascertaining the numbers who pay tax on properties let and so on. It would be useful to include an incentive for tenants to register themselves and seek the tax relief to which they <Col N="922"/>are entitled. This will have the kick-on effect of providing more revenue to the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 14, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>g</i>) Subsection (1) shall not apply to expenses incurred by the body corporate in or in connection with a medical examination for a director or employee where the director is not a proprietary director and/or the employee is not a relative, as defined by section 433(3)(<i>a</i>) of a proprietary director of the body corporate;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to benefit-in-kind that may be chargeable to a person who receives some benefit from the company for which he or she works. For those employees with a company car, for example, the benefit-in-kind claw-back is substantial. Such a claw-back also applies for employees whose health insurance is provided by their employer.</P>
      <P>The monetary gain to those employees whose companies provide them with regular health check-ups is small, involving perhaps &euro;50 to &euro;100 in each instance. In the interests of promoting good health, such arrangements should not be considered as constituting benefit-in-kind for employees. We should all encourage people to have regular check-ups to maintain good health. Deputy O&rsquo;Shea and I have discussed on a number of occasions the importance of identifying potential health problems at an early stage. The old adage that a &ldquo;stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; is relevant in that catching a medical condition in its infancy can be of major benefit to the long-term prognosis of the sufferer and can avoid the need for expensive hospitalisation, which is to the benefit of the individual and the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Companies should be encouraged to have a caring attitude towards their employees. If they are prepared to fund regular medical check-ups for workers, such provision should not be deemed to be benefit-in-kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I pointed out on Committee Stage that I would return to this amendment. I recall that acceptance of it would require that all medical examinations undertaken by employees and directors, other than proprietary directors or connected persons, and paid for by that company would not be subject to the provisions for benefit-in-kind introduced in the 2004 Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the cost of providing medical check-ups that employees are <Col N="923"/>required to undergo by their employer is not regarded as a taxable benefit and is not liable to PAYE or PRSI. Routine medical check-ups paid for but not required by the employer are treated as giving rise to a taxable benefit. On reflection, I have no plans to change that position.</P>
      <P>I have considered the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion but I do not intend to widen the scope of the current provision. The current provision is reasonably generous, in that, employees are still able to claim back medical expenses against their income tax. In addition, if an employer chooses to pay for such examinations under the small benefits exemption threshold of &euro;250, which I announced in my last budget, his or her employees would not be liable to a benefit-in-kind charge on this benefit. On that basis I am not in favour of accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s clarification on this matter, but I did not follow the last part of it. Is the Minister saying that if a provision costs under &euro;250 it is not deemed to be a benefit-in-kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>The gist of what the Minister said is that if a company requires employees to have a medical check-up, it is not considered to be a benefit-in-kind and that might be the way to proceed with such a provision. If an estimated cost for such a provision is below &euro;250 it does not count as benefit-in-kind. That is a good clarification of the position. On that basis, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P LI="3">and</P>
      <P LI="3">(<i>b</i>) by substituting the following for subsection (2):</P>
      <P LI="4">&lsquo;(2) Where, for the whole or part of a year of assessment, there is outstanding, in relation to an individual, a preferential loan, the individual shall, subject to subsection (4), be treated for the purposes of section 112 or a charge to tax under Case III of Schedule D, as having received in that year of assessment, as a perquisite of the office or employment with the employer who made the loan, a sum equal to&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="5">(<i>a</i>) if no interest is payable on the preferential loan or loans, the amount of interest which would have been payable in that year, if interest had been payable on the loan or loans at the specified rate, or</P>
      <P LI="5">(<i>b</i>) if interest is paid or payable at a preferential rate or rates, the difference between the aggregate amount of interest paid or payable in that year and the amount of interest which would have been payable in that year, if interest had been payable on the loan or loans at the specified rate,</P>
      <P LI="4" FLI="0">and the individual or, in the case of an individual who is a wife whose husband is chargeable to tax for the year of assessment in accordance with the provisions of section 1017, the spouse of the individual, shall be charged to tax accordingly.&rsquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to amend section 122 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to confirm that the charge to tax under the section, in respect of the benefit-in-kind to an employee for an employer provided preferential loan, applies for each year in which there is a balance outstanding on the loan.</P>
      <P>The issue arises as a result of an appeal commissioner hearing in which it was ruled that, as presently constructed, section 122 only imposes a tax charge for the first year in which a preferential loan is made and not for any subsequent year. The appeal commissioner based his determination on certain wording of the section that he maintains results in an ambiguity in the section.</P><Col N="925"/>
      <P>However, the commissioner&rsquo;s determination is not accepted by the Revenue Commissioners, and Revenue intends to pursue the matter vigorously through the courts by way of a case stated. The charge was always intended, as has been operated since 1982, to apply to each year that a loan is outstanding.</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the proposed court action by the Revenue Commissioners, it seems appropriate to ensure that the intent of section 122 is copperfastened, and that a charge to tax under the section on an employee clearly applies for each year in which the employee has a preferential loan outstanding.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>My amendment proposes that the relief should be further extended to provide such relief for employees whose working arrangements is not as regular as those of employees who work year in year out with the same employer. I refer to employees in casual employment or contract-base employment. The relief should be applied for the several months or longer periods while such persons are in employment or on such contracts. The Minister did not see fit to accept a similar amendment on Committee Stage, but I hope he has had an opportunity to reconsider this proposal in the interim.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked me on Committee Stage whether I proposed that such tax relief should be extended to the employee. While that was not my intention, it is not a bad idea. A tax system that favours public transport over private transport is a matter to which we need to give serious consideration. If such a tax relief existed, it would increase the use of public transport services throughout the country and have an effect of increasing demand for them, especially in areas where none exists. If the Minister is inclined to think along those lines in the future, he will have my support and that of the Green Party.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates strictly to tax relief as it applies to employers giving payment for travel expenses and requesting that it be applied more frequently than on a annual basis for the benefit of many employees whose employment conditions are less regular than those of the regular employee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes to exempt from tax all monthly travel passes for travel to and from work. To encourage the use of public transport, my predecessor, Charlie McCreevy, introduced legislation in 1999 to exempt from a charge to tax the resultant benefit-in-kind where an employer provides a free monthly or annual bus or rail pass for an employee. The bus or rail pass must be issued by CIE or its subsidiaries, a private bus operator or a person who provides a passenger transport service in accordance with the Transport Act 1950. In last year&rsquo;s Bill the exemption was extended to cover the Luas and other light rail or metro services. In this year&rsquo;s Bill I am extending the exemption further to cover ferry services within the State.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage debate the Deputy appeared to be concerned that in order for the exemption to apply, employees had to be given annual travel passes and, therefore, the exemption would not be available to seasonal workers. As I already indicated, the exemption applies to a monthly or annual travel pass, but to qualify for the exemption the employer must incur the expense of the pass. It is not, however, sufficient for an employer to purchase a pass and recover the cost from the employee &mdash; in such circumstances the expense will have to be incurred by the employee. However, Revenue accepts, subject to conditions, that where an employee renegotiates his or her remuneration package, taking a travel pass in exchange for a reduction in salary, the employer can be regarded in that instance as having borne the cost of the travel pass and the exemption will apply.</P>
      <P>Revenue requires the following conditions to be satisfied. There must be a bona fide and enforceable alternation to the terms and conditions of employment, exercising a choice of benefit instead of salary. The alteration must not be retrospective and must be evidenced in writing. There must be no entitlement to exchange the benefit for cash. The choice exercised, that is, the benefit instead of cash, cannot be made more frequently than once a year and then only with the consent of the employer.</P>
      <P>The current system works well and seems to cover the scenario for which the Deputy wants to cater. There is no prohibition in the legislation on an employer giving an employee a monthly travel pass, once the employer and not the employee bears the cost. Accordingly, I do not see any need for the amendment and I am not in a position nor do I propose to accept it.</P>
      <P>The advantages of the scheme, as it stands, are that it is subject to control, it is easily administered and reasonably well targeted. Widening of the exemption in the manner suggested would dilute these advantages and go significantly beyond the original policy intention of the scheme. It would also be much more costly than the existing scheme and would need to be fully considered in a budgetary context.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for that clarification which I am sure will be helpful for people who need to access this relief in the future. However, I am disappointed with the second part of his reply. I encourage him to examine the costings that might be involved in such an extension of the relief. If such a cost benefit analysis were done, although it has not been done in regard to other tax reliefs, and if there was a greater take up of public transport and such a tax incentive existed, we might see economic benefits with the relaxation of gridlock on many roadways throughout the country. Towards the end of his reply the Minister indicated that such an extension of the exemption would require an examination. Will he indicate whether he would be prepared to engage in such an examination and report to the House on what it might cost? That would leave the House better informed on whether such a extension of the relief could be pursued as a policy goal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The travel pass tax relief scheme was introduced on the basis that employers would incur its cost and employees would accept a reduction in salary to allow it to work and to show its transparency and enforceability. The scheme involves people using the public transport system rather than organising private transport. An application form for benefit-in-kind in respect of bus and train passes is available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am extending the remit of the scheme today to cover people living on islands who need to get to work on the mainland. As I said, I propose to extend the scheme to take into account the proposed Dublin city ferry service, which will be along the lines of similar services in other cities. I am trying to ensure that such an innovative idea can compete with established modes of transport by being the subject of benefit-in-kind provisions in the same way.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that I should extend the scheme so that people can receive a benefit-in-kind by having a travel pass, in addition to their existing salary levels. The cost of such a provision would be borne by the taxpayer rather than by employers. We would have to consider the suggestion carefully before being in a position to agree to it.</P>
      <P>The best way to get more people to use the public transport system is to provide quality public transport facilities. While we did not invest sufficiently in such facilities in the past, the current Government&rsquo;s record is second to none.</P>

	<P>We need to put in place a railway safety programme before we can improve rail services. There has been a history of under-investment in this country&rsquo;s railway system over the past 60 years. The railway safety programme that is necessary to facilitate improved rail services costs hundreds of millions of euro, although it is a good investment. The Luas system has been brought on stream successfully. The Government has further ideas for the integration of the transport system. I have indicated to the Minister for Transport that I am prepared to examine the provision of a ten-year capital envelope for transport to allow the Government to plan the phased development of the network. One third of the Government&rsquo;s enhanced capital programme is devoted to the transport sector. Members may have concerns about so much of it being spent on roads rather than rail&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Mr. Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The proportion of the funds being spent on the road network is too big.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>No, we need interurban road networks as well. It is not one or the other. We need to provide for all forms of public transport within realistic budgetary parameters. We need to make clear that we are sanctioning certain projects and then proceed to develop them. Everyone has a wish list and a vision of how things should develop, but we have to set priorities and recognise that there is a need for all modes of transport, particularly in urban areas like Dublin. I believe that the debate about the competing merits of rail and road services will intensify. The Government has given a commitment to examine how it can provide improved public transport. It understands that encouraging the greater use of public transport relates not only to the tax system, but also to the quality of investment.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes a system of tax relief for child care expenses, an issue that has provoked a great deal of discussion in recent times. Many people are aggrieved because they do not receive enough help with the child care costs they are incurring. I recently spoke to a young couple with two children and they commute to work not from County Westmeath but from County Meath, on the main road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I knew the story would relate to County Kildare or County Meath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>They said their child care costs are approximately &euro;1,500 per month. It is as if they have to pay another huge mortgage on top of their mortgage. The payment of such large sums of money for child care is an enormous burden on young people. I assume they somehow manage to pay for child care as long as the money is flowing. They know that the period of time when they have to pay for such care will come to an end. I shudder at the thought that people in such circumstances will be made redundant, become ill and unable to work or encounter financial pressure, for example if their calculations go wrong. We would then see the consequences of the pressure that is placed on young couples.</P>
      <P>We discussed yesterday the taxation disadvantages faced by single-income families compared to double-income families. The issue of child care costs is related because such expenses are often incurred by double-income families. Such families may enjoy financial benefits in terms of tax relief by reverting to being single-income families, who are being discriminated against at present. I cited <Col N="930"/>yesterday the example of two families living side by side, each with an overall income of &euro;56,000, but one of which is a single-income household while the other is a double-income household. The family with one income pays &euro;7,000 more per annum &mdash;&euro;140 per week &mdash; in income tax to the Revenue Commissioners for the privilege of being a single-income family. We may have differences of opinion in this regard, but that is wrong.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am spoiled because I was reared in a single-income household and, just like the Minister, I now live in such a household. We may have to pay the price for the privilege of having somebody at home to look after our children. I am worried that we are narrowing the options available to young people. Mortgages are at an all-time high when considered as a percentage of income. When I got married, the mortgage on my house was £28 per month. It seemed like a substantial proportion of my income, but within three or four years my weekly wage had increased by more than my monthly mortgage. Young people who have committed themselves to enormous and frightening mortgages do not have as a real option the possibility of setting up single-income households.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I spoke about the taxation problems of such people yesterday. Will the Minister try to do something about the child care costs faced by those who cannot choose to be part of a single-income family because they cannot afford to do so? He will tell me that the Government is using the child benefit system to help people with their child care costs, but the monthly payment the State makes to families would not pay for a week&rsquo;s care of a single child. The payments offered by the Government are grossly short of what is needed. The Minister has argued that if he were to offer tax relief as I have suggested, he would distort the level of equality in the system. He is correct to state that my proposal would not benefit families with low incomes and welfare incomes, but other child care options are open to the Government to assist such households.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is to examine this matter seriously, I suggest he should consider the merits of the Australian system. Under that system, everybody is entitled to vouchers for child care, regardless of whether one is employed or in receipt of social welfare.</P>
      <P>There is an income threshold such that the well-off about whom the Minister spoke would not qualify. However, the voucher system is very fair. Anybody, be he or she unemployed or otherwise, can cash in his or her voucher for child care.</P>
      <P>Although I am suggesting one model, it does not represent the end of the story. The Minster, in his new portfolio, may want to consider it. I know he is prepared to examine proposals and make up his own mind thereon. I do not know how many options he has had the opportunity to consider, but I encourage him to examine the Australian system which I believe worked partic<Col N="931"/>ularly well. There are registered cr&egrave;ches throughout that country.</P>
      <P>The Australian system also regularised the sector, which is very important. Ireland has problems at present in that many child care facilities are not in the system or regularised. They need to be regularised such that standards will be set and people will know that if they avail of a particular child care facility, it will be registered and meet those standards. The system I propose would achieve this.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably not accept my amendment, as on Committee Stage, but he should agree to study the various types of facilities available and the options that exist. Child benefit is not the only option that should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment enthusiastically. He has reflected the factual circumstances in which the greater number of parents find themselves. I am one of those parents who are directly affected by childminding costs. We have heard it said many times that such costs comprise the second mortgage. However, in the greater number of cases, including in my experience, childminding costs exceed the monthly mortgage commitment depending on the number of children and the opportunities available. In the cases of some families, including mine, children are attending more than one service provider daily.</P>
      <P>There is a great responsibility to recognise the importance of addressing this area. I indicated prior to my making my pre-budget submission to the Minister for Finance that this was the single most important issue that needed to be addressed in his first budget. It is sad that he was unable to address this and related needs in respect of children&rsquo;s requirements on this occasion. It is therefore all the more important to impress on him the importance of prioritising the need to address this area for the budget for 2006.</P>
      <P>Deputy Paul McGrath is quite right that child benefit, as the Government&rsquo;s preferred approach, comprises an erroneous response. I hope it is not the answer the Minister will offer because child benefit since its inception was never intended for this particular area. This is by and large a new growth area in terms of the changing reality of society whereby both parents or a single parent are in the workplace of necessity because of many reasons I and other colleagues have articulated during the course of our debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>We must also bear in mind that the system as it stands is a disincentive to people to have more children. There are no additional supports and certain people, particularly women who may have engaged in training or education, perhaps at third level, and who may have a career or profession, are quite rightly anxious to maintain their involvement in the workplace. The reality for many is that the greater part of what they earn is expended on childminding costs, particularly dur<Col N="932"/>ing their children&rsquo;s early and critical years. This is a considerable disincentive that is contrary to the interests of society and the economy, especially given the concerns over who will fund future pension provisions because of our depleting native workforce and our growing dependency on labour from overseas.</P>
      <P>There is a need to take a holistic view of this matter and consider the by-products, deficiencies and negatives that arise from the system as it operates. I know many couples who would not consider having more children simply because of the affordability issue. Therefore, there is a bounden need to grapple with this issue and a responsibility on the Government to recognise the considerable scale and growth of the child care sector. One way by which the matter can be addressed, without detracting in any way from the Government&rsquo;s responsibility to provide safe, funded child-minding facilities, is to have preschool provision. This is not the direct responsibility of the Minister for Finance but the collective responsibility of the Cabinet. There is a considerable deficiency and a need for consistency and regulation in this sector, which is currently inadequately provided for.</P>
      <P>On the Minister&rsquo;s direct responsibility, the proposition contained in Deputy Paul McGrath&rsquo;s amendment is worthy of his adoption. If in the budget for 2006 he addresses the serious need to extend relief to parents, whether they be single or in couples, he will have made a great contribution to the daily reality of ordinary people who grapple with the constraints of the demands they face. I commend the amendment to him and look forward to hearing his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The first principle of the Labour Party&rsquo;s approach to child care is to offer families, irrespective of whether they involve one or two parents, choices regarding how they wish to bring up their children. The current child care model focuses excessively on the needs of employers who want to have both parents in the workforce. While this is justifiable economically, we as legislators also need to consider the needs of parents and their children and the generational effect.</P>
      <P>I spoke yesterday about the different kinds of cr&egrave;ches. Given the concentration of tax breaks on building facilities and the concentration of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rsquo;s equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 on built facilities in the private sector and, to a lesser extent, the community sector, we are, for the reasons I outlined yesterday, losing sight of what this matter is about. It is about how our children are brought up. I hope this is with the love, care and attention of their families. Babies are left in cr&egrave;ches when their parents, if they live in the commuter belt around Dublin, leave home before 7 a.m. A child care place for a baby for a week in most cr&egrave;ches is more than &euro;200 because it is expensive to care for a small baby. The parents may not return home until 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. The Minister&rsquo;s children are probably young <Col N="933"/>enough for him to know that many cr&egrave;ches charge a penalty if the parent arrives late. A cr&egrave;che is a professional business operation which is very tough on young parents.</P>
      <P>Ireland is said to be the second richest country in Europe but most other European countries allow one or both parents to be at home on maternity, paternity or a combination of leave for most of the first year of a baby&rsquo;s life. In this way the baby experiences a loving family environment.</P>
      <P>The equal opportunities child care programme run by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has failed. Ireland has a long and good tradition of some child care being available through the extended family and neighbourhood. A grandmother, sister, cousin or woman down the road might take on the job. Some women who have reared their children or whose children are in school all day decide to mind a baby or two children.</P>
      <P>The programme does not provide for that traditional type of service which many parents love because the children are nearby or with a relative. They are not fined if they are five minutes late to collect the child. In addition, the child sees the minder at holiday times and the minder may even occasionally take the baby overnight. When we move to a social worker-determined model, we should not throw out our traditional family values. I hope the Minister will have influence over the debate.</P>
      <P>The county child care committees are very expensive to operate. They correctly focus on levels of training but love and care are more important for a baby. It does not matter if one has a degree in babyminding and so on. The quality of the love, care and attention given to the baby is essential. Registration, training and the quality of the premises are important too. We have, however, closed down the informal sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor introduced a tax break for letting a room to the value of &euro;6,000. I have often wondered whether this was a good or bad initiative. There are many black economy childminders, some good, some not. Surely it is not beyond our imagination to devise a scheme to bring some of these good, traditional family-based childminders into the system. It may be difficult because there are many other attractive employment options available. We should not choose a model for large-scale private sector provision in a small community.</P>
      <P>In many ways the Child Care Act 1991 opted for a Rolls Royce legislative model when there were not enough resources or people for that model. It was right in theory but has not worked out well in practice. Some of the people working in the former health boards were more interested in covering their backs. The situation resembles that of a lady selling apple tarts who is hounded by the environmental protection officer when in most other European countries people would be waving a flag to advertise her baking and she would be selling to the local hotel and so on.</P><Col N="934"/>
      <P>There is another side to that and one does not want the guests in the hotel to suffer class one food poisoning. There ought, however, to be a balanced model of regulation which recognises some of our positive traditions in this respect. Deputy Paul McGrath said there is more than one model of child care. In Ireland, traditionally, there are four models, all of which should be considered.</P>
      <P>What is being done for parents who have teenage children, particularly boys? After school, services exist but often teenagers at different stages in their lives need access to the presence of their parents. They do not want their parents to talk to them but they need their parents while they go through the experience of growing up. Within the Civil Service there has been a positive development on job-sharing and on the facility to take leave.</P>
      <P>A woman may start to work at approximately the age of 23 or 25, having graduated and qualified and maybe taken a master&rsquo;s degree. If she is to work until she is 65, why not acknowledge that for five to seven years of that period she and her partner may have important home and family commitments? It is wonderful that many fathers are interested in spending time with their children and sharing the fun and the exasperation of child care.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister can bring some imagination to this debate and that it is not simply driven by the needs of employers who want women workers. While that is a justifiable economic demand, it should not be the exclusive determinant of what we do about child care provision. The Minister yesterday mentioned child benefit. When I was Minister of State in the then Department of Social Welfare and Deputy Woods was the senior Minister, I brought forward the idea that the child benefit payment was the way to avoid a poverty trap. Everybody, including the present Minister for Finance, followed this.</P>
      <P>A report on that subject, chaired by Peter Malone, a prominent employer in the hotel trade at the time, was designed to overcome the poverty traps which then existed if people on a social welfare income took up work. Other countries offer refundable child credits. Deputy Paul McGrath mentioned countries with voucher systems. Something similar should be possible here and that is one of the reasons to examine the technical capacity of the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; information technology system.</P>
      <P>The take-up and targeting of the family income supplement is a mess. Public sector employers are the most likely to avail of this because they are prepared to deal with the paperwork. Several models exist and perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service should consider these to decide what works and what fits with our cultural traditions regarding children.</P>
      <P>I have followed with close attention the history of institutional care and the very sad situation that existed for many people. Now, on the basis <Col N="935"/>of tax breaks, we are creating large-scale cr&egrave;ches, particularly for young babies. What will be the effect of those in 25 years&rsquo; time? Would it not be better if we balanced that tax break with a greater possibility for either or both parents to be with their baby for longer and to use that time for caring? Children are babies for just a short period. Time passes and then they are teenagers who will not even speak to their parents.</P>
      <P>Instead of being led by the nose by social policy experts, some of us in this House should have confidence in what we believe is good or bad and we should leave the choice to individual parents and families. The Minister said he will examine the issue, in which I wish him well. There will be tremendous support from parties across the House if he is able to open up the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased we have reached the end of the debate and that finally there is something on which I can agree with Deputy Burton. Her sentiments are close to mine on the question of ensuring that we do not end up with an institutionalised setting for child rearing. Obviously cr&egrave;ches and child minding services have a role to play, but it is not an exclusive place. There is a need to examine pragmatically and practically what can be done in regard to providing family support. Making the situation more complicated than it is already would be a point of departure for me in terms of how one might go about solving the problem. It is just part of the problem. People must be able to make choices. There is not one uniform way of dealing with the issue. The tax system is not the only way to deal with the matter. As Deputy McGrath said, there is a basic problem in that those who most need child care facilities, including low income families, would not be able to avail of such a tax credit. The basic issue is how to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>Child benefit was not designed to deal with this issue. At least it has a universal element in that it provides support for families with children. Thankfully, the changes in tax policy reduced the tax wedge in that people are moving out of poverty. People now have more opportunities and more jobs are being created in the service industries. Non-Irish people are now taking up many of the jobs in traditional service industries, which is an indication of how people are changing their views on the type of trade or profession they would like to take up.</P>
      <P>Significant sums of money are being spent on capital allowances for employers, child benefit, which amounts to almost &euro;2 billion, and the programme to which the Deputy referred. However, more needs to be done on the supply side. More than &euro;330 million has been spent on the capital budget for 2005-09 under the equal opportunities programme. This provides for an additional 17,000 places. There must be flexibility. We should not try to complicate the issue further when trying to devise a method whereby people can deal with the issue of child rearing services. <Col N="936"/>We are all aware of the high cost of this service. Child benefit was not introduced to replace or supplement this cost, but it is extra money available to families. Interest rates are low, even though property prices have increased. This has resulted in higher mortgage repayments. Higher wages and more labour friendly tax policies have enabled people to deal with these issues. People are spending a great deal of money for some of these services, but they are in a position to do so. It would be unthinkable 20 years ago when salaries were so low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. P. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no margin for error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy referred to the difference in treatment of one earner or two earner families. The difference might be closer to five and seven, but that is beside the point. More often high child care costs apply to two income families rather than to one income families. Unless there is such a discrepancy, families would not have the ability to deal with these additional costs. That is not to draw a distinction between the quality of parenting in either household; it is just a social fact of life, because one cannot be in two places at the one time. The difference in treatment takes account of that social change. Unfortunately, because the equal treatment of families was dealt with previously, regardless of whether these were one earner families or two earner families, people interpreted it as diminishing the role of motherhood in the home and so on, which is not the case. One must explain as best one can what is behind this provision.</P>
      <P>The increase in participation of women in the workforce &mdash; their role is not restricted to that of motherhood in the home &mdash; has brought about the need for the tax policy to reflect that social reality. Maintaining the equal treatment policy would mean that two income earner families would not have feasible options. Real choice sometimes requires different approaches for different sets of circumstances rather than saying this is the way the tax system must work for everyone. People are beginning to understand what was behind the policy, rather than the unfavourable comments that initially met the former Minister, Deputy McCreevy&rsquo;s, introduction of the policy. It was ameliorated by the home carer&rsquo;s credit, which people saw as a sudden break with the established way of dealing with matters.</P>
      <P>I am not claiming that we are approaching a comprehensive solution to the problem. Neither do I believe the tax policy is the means by which one can compensate in full families for the cost of child care. That would be a wrong message to send out. It is a question of ensuring that there is available to households sufficient disposable income to enable them to make choices that would have an additional cost compared to someone in different circumstances. One cannot socially plan for everyone to carry an equal burden in respect of the expenses they incur in view <Col N="937"/>of what they choose to do, where they want to work, how long it takes them to get to work, the cr&egrave;ches available to them and so on. However, we must broaden the options for child care. It is not simply a question of providing more cr&egrave;ches or boosting the programme by hundreds of millions of euro. As has been said in this debate, it is a question of this House, on an all-party basis or through the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service if necessary, seeing what it can do to achieve a pragmatic solution of the child care issue.</P>

    <Title>Report on Long-Stay Care Charges: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>This debate is about the Travers report, and the Travers report is about performance and accountability. Every person who draws a salary paid by taxpayers has a responsibility to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They are the boss. We have a sophisticated system of democratic Government and accountability. Sometimes it is cumbersome, sometimes it is very procedural but it is democratic and fair. Ultimately, no one can be exempt from answering for the level of responsibilities they are given, or have sought, in public service.</P>
      <P>I believe in political accountability and I am prepared to accept political accountability, clear, undiluted and unequivocal. I only ask of others what I ask of myself. I will answer for my decisions and for the decisions of any Government of which I am a part. I accept I can make mistakes. Governments can make mistakes. I believe there can be a tolerance for error. I do not think we should create moral and political gridlock by setting impossibly high standards for anyone in public service, elected or official.</P>
      <P>I am required to take political responsibility by answering to the Oireachtas and I am not talking about the zero sum game of political charges across the floor of the House. I do not believe that if one comes away with a nil-all draw, one is somehow discharging one&rsquo;s political responsibility.</P>
      <P>I believe in simple, straightforward accountability to the Oireachtas: an honest account of information available to a Minister, the reasons for decisions and an explanation of the substance and effect of those decisions. This is not rocket science or high political theory. It is the straightforward approach I adopt when I speak in the House, when I bring forward legislation, or when I sign off on 300 or more parliamentary questions on a particular day.</P>
      <P>I am the political head of the Department of Health and Children and I will answer for that. As political head of the Department, I will work with everyone to learn from these events and work towards top class public sector performance. I said to each member of the departmental staff yesterday that I recognise the administrative culture of any Department is influenced by the style and leadership of its political head. I accept my responsibility in the coming months and years to lead the Department with a professional, effective and trusting relationship between officials and Ministers.</P>
      <P>The Travers report speaks for itself about the extent of administrative and political responsibility for the handling of the charges issue. There <Col N="940"/>is no fudge in his conclusions: there has been systemic administrative failure. There have also been lapses of judgment over the years by Ministers and they could have probed issues more. The main failure has been administrative.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers is a man of great integrity. I accept his assessment wholly and entirely as that of a highly skilled, professional, former civil servant. He knows what he is talking about on these issues.</P>
      <P>I stand over my handling of this issue since October last. I asked for legal advice as soon as the issue was rased in the House by Deputy Kenny. There was a legal issue and I sought advice. I acted on legal advice when I received it. I stopped the charges within a day of being told they should stop. I confirmed my belief that there had been political and public support over many years for the principle that people should make some contribution towards the cost of shelter and maintenance.</P>
      <P>I took seriously the problem of a loss of income of &euro;10 million per month to our health services. It can be difficult enough to find an extra &euro;1 million when needed. The health boards or the Health Service Executive could not easily do without &euro;10 million per month.</P>
      <P>I quickly prepared legislation for the Government. Most unfortunately, the Government&rsquo;s decisions on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 were based on inaccurate and incomplete information. The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in advance of that decision was based in part on poor, inaccurate and incomplete information.</P>
      <P>I do not know what we would have decided if we had had all the information in the Travers report available to us last December. It is hypothetical and I cannot speculate. I have no doubt our decision-making process would have been substantially different had we had the full facts then.</P>
      <P>People will now say we should have waited for any consideration of the charges issue until we had the full information contained in the Travers report. That misses the point. I did ask for a full report for myself and for the Government on the issue. We were entitled to rely wholly on that information. Our system of Government would collapse if we had to ask for a second, external report every time we asked for information from the Civil Service. We would end up creating a second Civil Service. We rely on our Civil Service for very good reason because the norm is that information is accurate, relevant and complete.</P>
      <P>I have been accused of instituting the Travers report as political cover for the Government&rsquo;s decision on retrospection. That is a vile charge. It shows ignorance of the facts and ignorance of how Government makes its decisions. I asked for Mr. Travers&rsquo; report when it become clear to me, after the Government meeting of Tuesday, 14 December, that the information made available to the Government was incorrect in a key respect. <Col N="941"/>I saw a need for a professional external evaluation to be carried out quickly and efficiently. The discovery process for the Supreme Court hearings and work on the Travers report began in parallel in January. In the course of both, my Department brought me some of the information now in the Travers report. The result was that in the Supreme Court, counsel for the State did not argue that the charges had been made in good faith. I was also obliged to correct the record of the House in respect of the statements the Taoiseach and I made that these charges had been levied in good faith and the Department believed it had a legally defensible position. I very much regret this.</P>
      <P>The Government made its decision on retrospection in the December legislation, based on legal advice and in the context of a different understanding of what it might be required to repay if court cases were taken. I believe it is relevant that none of the main political parties insisted, either now or back in December, that the policy should be to repay all the amounts back to 1976, and that the Statute of Limitations should not be used in respect of estates.</P>
      <P>This begs the question as to what was to be done about repayments as a legal requirement or as policy choice. That question confronted the Government from the start last December. This complex issue can only be addressed with precise information, but as I have pointed out, the information given to me and to the Government was not fit for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I stand over what I said in the debate in the House on the Supreme Court decision. Had the Government taken any other action, the public and the people in public long-term care places would still be mired in legal uncertainty and there would be a multiplicity of legal cases for years ahead about repayments of charges.</P>
      <P>I return to the main point. Approximately 315,000 people were illegally charged during 28 years and this was entirely wrong. As vulnerable people they were especially entitled to the protection of the law and to legal certainty about their situation. The charges should never have been made illegally, even though the principle of charging for shelter and maintenance had broad public and political acceptance. This is a society ruled by law; no person and no organisation can dispense with or alter a law. I will meet my political accountability under the law for my ministerial role, for Government decisions and for the legislation I bring to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this debate as an opportunity for the House to consider what is an extremely detailed and comprehensive report. It is an opportunity for the House to consider what is actually in the report rather than the Opposition&rsquo;s spin on what it contains. The report examines all the elements of how a charge ruled illegal <Col N="942"/>by the Supreme Court in 1976 was kept in place for 28 years. Why the decision was made at that time to maintain the charge without making any attempt to regularise it and why it was not dealt with until now is complex and reveals a substantial systems failure over 28 years. By presenting such an extensive treatment of the facts the report allows us to understand this failure.</P>
      <P>I will comment primarily on those parts of the report which relate to the last period it examines. Just like 160 other Deputies, I was not a Member of the House in 1976 or for some time after that. I will not pretend to have detailed knowledge of events of that time, or for most of the subsequent period, but if we are to understand this issue we have to look at what happened during this time because the past few years fit fundamentally into a pattern established 28 years ago. It must be noted that for several months we have heard an ongoing cycle of spin and misrepresentation. Many people in this House have repeatedly tried to pre-empt and prejudge this report. Now that it has been published, the same people are choosing to ignore facts that do not suit their arguments. Faced with a choice between trying to examine and understand a major failure stretching across three decades or simply playing politics, they have chosen the latter. The culture of playing the man and not the ball and foundation-rocking is now so all pervasive for the Opposition that they have no interest in serious debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputies Twomey and Kenny, for example, earlier this week issued a list of questions they said had to be answered by the report, even though they knew the report had been completed. What makes this even more breathtakingly cynical is that Mr. Travers asked Fine Gael, just like other Opposition parties, if it wished to make a submission. Fine Gael did not even respond to him. One of the biggest misrepresentations has been the attempt to confuse discussions on eligibility with discussions on the illegal charge enforced in 1976.</P>
      <P>The House should be aware that eligibility criteria under health schemes are at the very heart of almost all discussions on health policy. Discussions on eligibility take place all the time <Col N="943"/>and will have played a significant role in the work of every Minister since 1976. The fact of the illegal charge and its imposition since 1976 is an entirely different issue and the report is absolutely clear in stating that the discussion of one does not imply a discussion of the other. If the Opposition parties are credibly suggesting that all eligibility discussions must, of necessity, have involved a discussion of the illegal charge, they must now explain why they are trying to apply a different standard to the past two years to the standard that applied when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>The root of this issue is to be found squarely in what the report calls the, &ldquo;foundation decision&rdquo; of the Regulation 7/76 signed by the Labour Party Minister for Health and Fine Gael Minister for Finance in 1976 and sent to the health boards. This regulation and the accompanying letter sent to the health boards ignored the High Court&rsquo;s decision in the McInerney case and instructed the boards that they were entitled to charge long-stay patients irrespective of whether they had full eligibility. From the point of this &ldquo;foundation decision&rdquo; the issue surfaced at different times and in different ways over 28 years and this is illustrated in Mr. Travers&rsquo; report.</P>
      <P>I will cite some examples from the report. In 1979 the Department&rsquo;s legal adviser reiterated concerns about the 1976 regulations. In January 1982 a specific review of the regulations stated they had no legal basis. In 1987 a legislative change was proposed but not proceeded with. In 1992 a review of long-stay charges was completed and legislative change advocated. In 1994 the health strategy stated that the legislative basis for charges was inadequate and promised legislative change.</P>
      <P>In inquiring into the period during which I was Minister, Mr. Travers had full access to every document and every person involved in the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>What about the missing files?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>He examined all aspects of how the issue was raised or failed to be raised. In respect of the extension of medical card cover to the over-70s by means of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, the report shows that no submission was made to me that existing charges were illegal and that they should be regularised through the legislation. The report shows, however, that the Act ultimately forced clarification of the issues. There is no doubt that the receipt of a legal opinion prepared for the South Eastern Health Board in March 2003 should have led to rapid action.</P>
      <P>The report confirms that the first action taken involved it being referred to a joint meeting of the Department&rsquo;s management committee and the chief executive officers of the health boards. This meeting was held on 16 December 2003. Of <Col N="944"/>the many elements dealt with in the report this is the one where the difference between the facts and the political attacks is most significant. The issue was listed on an agenda with 13 other items under the title, Long Stay Charges &mdash; Over 70s and was explicitly stated as being for &ldquo;brief mention only&rdquo;. The major topic for the meeting was intended to be, and was, the health reform programme, including the future position of the chief executive officers and the staff of health boards in the new health structures. Mr. Travers accepted that I was not present at the meeting when this issue was discussed and decided upon and Mr. Travers confirms that the decision to seek the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was a &ldquo;predictable&rdquo; one. The report confirms the position of all present at the meeting that the reform programme was the dominant issue and that it was followed by a meeting on the Hanly proposals. The record shows that the items for brief mention, of which I think there about five or six, were taken before I arrived&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Where was the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;specifically because they were not viewed as requiring my presence. It is certainly not the case that I missed the discussion because I was late. All the persons who attended the meeting confirmed that the item merited only a short discussion. The context of the discussion was that clarification was to be sought before it could be substantively considered. In light of the manner of the distribution of the briefing materials, the manner in which the issue was listed on the agenda, the brevity of the discussion and the fact that it was discussed as a matter requiring clarification before its importance could be assessed, I do not see how the Ministers of State or advisers present could reasonably have been expected to appreciate the urgency of the issue. This fits exactly into the pattern of briefings over 28 years, which the report describes as being &ldquo;at the most superficial of levels&rdquo; and &ldquo;completely inadequate&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On Tuesday of last week, Deputy Rabbitte made statements in this House about the treatment of the issue at the 16 December meeting. I will quote from the Official Report. The Deputy said: &ldquo;At that meeting this was the main issue discussed.&rdquo; Over the years Deputy Rabbitte has established a unique reputation for his willingness to read rumours into the record of the House. In light of the clarity of the report in showing that his statement was completely false and also his often stated demands that the record of the House be corrected, I look forward to hearing the Deputy withdrawing this statement and explaining why he chose to make it.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
      <P>Following the meeting of 16 December, the matter should have been referred to the Attorney General but was not. Exactly why this was not done is not clear. It seems to have been an error <Col N="945"/>which arose due to the undoubted large workload then being carried by officials. While the recollections of officials differ and are not fixed, as the different statements submitted during the course of the inquiry show, there is no doubt about the core issue. The fact is the file was not given to me and nor is there any record of it being given to me. This is particularly relevant because there was no reason for me to see the file. I was not required to take any decision or sign anything and, in fact, it would have been a departure from normal practice for it to have been brought to my attention, just as in other Departments legal advice is sought from the Office of the Attorney General on a regular basis and Ministers rarely play a role in this regard.</P>
      <P>The report also lays to rest the idea that I or my predecessors were briefed in any substantive way on the illegal charges and issue of retrospection. It states that, irrespective of whether it is accepted that the issue was mentioned, any briefings which may have happened were &ldquo;at the most superficial of levels&rdquo; and &ldquo;completely inadequate to what was required&rdquo;. It is worth quoting the report fully on this matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">Absolutely no documentation was made available to me to demonstrate or to indicate that the Minister had been fully and adequately briefed by the Department on the serious nature of the issues arising which the management of the Department acknowledge carried significant potential legal, financial and political consequences. Such briefings that did take place appear to be at the most superficial of levels.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Mr. Travers also states:</P>
      <P LI="1">I have come across many expressions of views in the course of preparing this report, that suggest that over the years Ministers were &ldquo;informed&rdquo;, &ldquo;advised&rdquo;, &ldquo;briefed&rdquo;, &ldquo;told&rdquo; in relation to the issues concerned . . . However, even if all such contentions are correct ... they would be completely inadequate to what was required given the nature, substance, risks and inevitable negative consequences of the practices in place.</P>
      <P FLI="0">During my time as Minister for Health and Children, the record will show that I was fully accessible to staff and willing to address issues even at the shortest of notice. At no time did I shy away from sensitive issues because they might have cost implications or reflect badly on Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did so every time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a policy I have followed throughout my ministerial career. In the normal course of events with an emerging issue, the relevant officials would seek a meeting with me, the issues and course of action would be discussed and a decision arrived at.</P><Col N="946"/>
      <P>The recollections of people about whether something was mentioned in passing as part of other discussions has been considered in detail by the report. Even if every person shared exactly the same recollections, there is no suggestion that briefings amounted to a substantive treatment which would have allowed Ministers to know about the seriousness of the issue or to take action. The Opposition has been stating for some time that I and others must have known. This is a way of ignoring the full evidence of the information available to us. If the decision of the Opposition is to reject the findings of the report on this issue, let it say so in a clear way and there should be no mistake in understanding this. If we accept the contention of Opposition parties that Ministers must have known because of the information in this report, they are rejecting a central finding of the report. If they want to do this, they must then get down to the business of showing how exactly the same types of briefings, when involving Ministers of their parties, should be treated differently. If they are indicating that Ministers should be able to know about every issue and take action on the basis of &ldquo;superficial&rdquo; and &ldquo;completely inadequate&rdquo; briefings, let them say so.</P>
      <P>The report also considers the issue of what would have happened had I and my predecessors been fully briefed. It has been suggested that we would have shied away from it because it was too sensitive. The report states the evidence does not support this as the required amendment is relatively uncomplicated and the idea that there should be such a contribution is widely accepted. In addition, it states: &ldquo;In the context of the many difficult and controversial decisions taken by successive Governments and successive Ministers of Health over the years a legislative change on the lines required to, effectively, legitimise existing practice could not, plausibly, be regarded as one of undue political difficulty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated at different times during my ministerial career, I have shown a full willingness to take on issues which were viewed as highly sensitive and showed failures over many years. For example, as Minister for Education and Science, I reversed the policy of the previous Government of ignoring issues of child abuse in State institutions. I also opened up the State&rsquo;s files and provided funding for groups whose aims involved questioning the role of the State. In this particular case, if I had been aware that an illegal charge was in place, I would have dealt with it.</P>
      <P>As I have said in the past, everybody in the Department of Health and Children carries a large workload and there is generally no let-up in terms of major issues to be dealt with. As Mr. Travers notes: &ldquo;The life and death nature of the issues with which it is concerned, the scale, the breadth and complexity of the policy agenda, the number of unpredictable events to be handled and the constant media and political attention all <Col N="947"/>combine to produce an environment of immense organisational and individual work pressures in which the urgent constantly conspires to drive out the important.&rdquo; He further notes that this practice of charges for persons in long-stay care in health board institutions &ldquo;was a case of &lsquo;good intentions&rsquo; not being supported by the requisite legal foundations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I strongly agree with the report&rsquo;s conclusions concerning the need to reform the operations of the Department. In this context, the report explicitly cites the structural reform programme I developed and helped to put in place as offering a &ldquo;new beginning&rdquo; for the Department. This was the intention of the programme, the most significant reform of the Department since its establishment. The Department must be given space to set strategies and oversee them rather than being constantly involved in minute issues of implementation.</P>
      <P>The report shows a 28-year story of the failure to deal with a problem which could easily have been rectified. The issue should have been brought clearly to the attention of successive Ministers but was not. Having considered in detail all elements of the information given to Ministers, the report concludes that it was at most provided &ldquo;at the most superficial of levels&rdquo; and was &ldquo;completely inadequate to what was required&rdquo;.</P>

	<P>Is the Minister drawing a line in the sand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Twomey and Perry. This is an important day for the House and the principle of political responsibility and accountability. It is a great honour and privilege to be appointed a Minister but with this privilege comes responsibility and accountability. These are set out in section 3 of the Public Service Management Act 1997 which states clearly that a Minister of the Government is responsible for the performance of the functions that are assigned to his Department. Nothing could be clearer. The political buck stops with the Minister, not the Secretary General, assistant secretary or the Minister&rsquo;s special advisers. There is a clear duty on every Minister to acquaint himself or herself with an issue when it is brought to his or her attention. The Minister who goes to &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in to receive his or her seal of office has this responsibility and nobody else.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the reaction of members of the Government, particularly the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, although she stated she accepts political responsibility, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, that they do not regard this legislation as applying to them. They assume they are some sort of elite or that they are superior and exempt from the law of the land which applies to the rest of us. This <Col N="948"/>is in sharp contrast to the incoherent hysterical rantings of some Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies when the party was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Government has tried to portray the Minister, Deputy Martin, as some sort of poor innocent soul, cut off from his Department and denied access to crucial information while the civil servants around him conspired to perpetrate a massive fraud. While there is evidence that management within the Department, especially in recent years, failed to deal properly with an issue which has such significant legal financial and political consequences, assigning that responsibility to the management of the Department does not exonerate the political head of the Department from his responsibilities. It is not the case that either civil servants or the Minister are responsible for running Departments. Responsibility is assigned to both, with the Minister as the political head of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, has claimed consistently that he was never given a briefing which allowed him to appreciate the significance of the charges issue. That is not true. The Travers report states in paragraph 4.36 that background papers on the charges issue were circulated to all those expected to attend the meeting of 16 December 2003. It then tells us in paragraph 4.41 that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, read these papers in advance of the meeting, as one would expect of any responsible Minister, and having read them formed the view, as he indicated in his evidence to Mr. Travers, that if the opinion and legal advice the South Eastern Health Board had received were correct, they would give rise to significant legal, operation, financial and political implications. The Minister also received this briefing. Whatever criticisms are made of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, for assuming the necessary legal advice was obtained, at least he met his fundamental ministerial responsibility by reading the documentation, although he seems to have disavowed his responsibility for this area because he has special responsibility for the intellectually disabled. The same cannot be said of the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin or the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely. The latter was so excited about the issue that he promised to brief the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Martin, but then failed to tell the Minister or follow up on an issue impacting directly on his area of responsibility. Last month, we will recall he announced a &euro;16 billion infrastructure programme without it being first approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in the House, I referred to the 2002 guidelines issued by the Taoiseach, informing Ministers of their responsibility to ensure systems are in place and operational to enable their Departments to meet their goals and objectives. <Col N="949"/>Chapter seven of the Travers report identifies large numbers of changes needed to the practices and procedures in the Department of Health and Children. It provides compelling evidence that the Department did not have systems in place to carry out its functions. According to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s guidelines, the Minister must take responsibility for such a system failure.</P>
      <P>The third area where the Minister, Deputy Martin, must face up to his responsibilities is that of his special advisers. The Public Service Management Act 1997 clearly sets out the legal position that special advisers are accountable for the performance of their function to the Minister who appointed them. In the Travers report, the then Minister&rsquo;s special advisers are criticised for their &ldquo;apparent lack of concern or even [apparent] interest&rdquo; in the issue of charges. He also states that they &ldquo;might have been expected to more actively probe and analyse the underlying issues involved&rdquo;. Serious issues arise concerning these special advisers. Why does Mr. Travers recommend that special advisers are not part of the line management system of the Department? These advisers received the same briefing note as the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley. They were there for the discussion that so excited the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, yet they still failed to brief their Minister. Their failure is the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, can run from this issue, but he cannot hide. He received a briefing that would have alerted him to the seriousness of the matter. Even if he did not get that briefing, he had a duty to ask questions. Whether it is brought to one&rsquo;s attention inside or outside the Department, ministerial accountability and responsibility requires a Minister to be briefed on every issue. Did the Minister, Deputy Martin, ask questions when the Human Rights Commission clearly spelled out the illegality of charges? Did he ask questions when the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a story that thousands of medical cards holders were being illegally charged? Did he even read the many replies he gave to parliamentary questions on the issue in this period? The T&aacute;naiste claims she must sign off on 300 parliamentary questions on some D&aacute;il sitting days. I have evidence from families who wrote to the then Minister, Deputy Martin, on these charges who never even received the courtesy of a reply from the Department.</P>
      <P>The picture that emerges is of a Minister, divorced from his officials, surrounded by special advisers, immersed in commissioning reports and craving photocalls and public relations opportunities, while underneath a major scandal was brewing. Contrast this with the approach of the late Mr. John Boland when Minister in 1987. He prepared legislative proposals, approved formally by the then Government on 5 February 1987. The incoming Government in March 1987 reviewed them but did not proceed with this legislation. <Col N="950"/>The then Minister for Health was none other than the Ceann Comhairle, a matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte this morning.</P>
      <P>I do not expect the Minister, Deputy Martin, will accept his responsibilities. The Taoiseach claims he has confidence in the Minister. I expected the Minister to tender his resignation on the matter. I do not expect the Taoiseach will have the courage to call on the Minister and the Ministers of State involved to resign. As the Secretary General, Mr. Kelly, briefed the Minister to some extent on the issue, it is still the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility. The two Ministers of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley and Callely, knew about the briefing document before 16 December 2003. The Minister&rsquo;s inactivity and inability to deal with the issue has cost the taxpayer &euro;500 million from 2001.</P>
      <P>I have given the T&aacute;naiste some credit for taking action when the Attorney General gave her his advice on stopping the charges. Consequently, she introduced a Bill which had to be referred to the Supreme Court and has left us in this mess. Of all the Ministers for Health, Deputy Martin was the one in possession of a briefing document before 16 December 2003. He knew these charges were illegal but did not act upon them. He has, therefore, abdicated his ministerial responsibilities. He must tender his resignation to the Taoiseach.</P>

	<P>I agree with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the Travers report was complete. It was complete in destroying the reputations of senior officials in the Department of Health and Children. It does not, however, cover the political responsibilities of the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, or the Ministers of State, Deputies Tim O&rsquo;Malley and Callely. It is clear from Mr. Travers&rsquo;s report that the briefing note that allowed the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to conclude issues in regard to nursing home charges is at variance with what has been said in the House, and elsewhere, by the Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Martin and Callely. The Fine Gael Party will call on the Minister to make a frank statement on these briefing notes at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Far too many questions remain unanswered in the report, particularly in the area of political responsibility. The conflict of evidence between the Minister, Deputy Martin, and Mr. Michael Kelly must be cleared up. There is disagreement between what was and was not said at a meeting on 10 March. We do not see any reason Mr. Kelly would lie to either the Minister or Mr. Travers. It is accepted that there was maladministration in the Department of Health and Children. <Col N="951"/>However, there has also been political irresponsibility in the Department, particularly since 2001.</P>
      <P>There is the issue of the missing letter to the Attorney General, which was not followed up. Mr. Kelly is of the belief that he passed the letter to the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, given its important consequences for the Department. An official who worked in the unit dealing with the charges who recalled it being in the ministerial suite supported Mr. Kelly&rsquo;s belief. He also recalled being approached by another official in the office to discuss the papers in question. This official&rsquo;s recollection is partly collaborated by another official from the minister&rsquo;s office who also recalls discussing this issue. There is significant evidence to suggest the file was in the ministerial secretariat at some stage. However, it seems to have gone missing.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kelly is rightly blamed for not keeping his eye on the matter and not following up to check if this letter went to the Attorney General. Equally, there is a political responsibility on both the then Minister, Deputy Martin and the then Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Callely, to give frank answers on where they stood in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>The role of ministerial advisers was not explained at the committee on health and children yesterday. Were Deputy Martin&rsquo;s advisers in the chain of command, a buffer between himself and his civil servants or were they lateral to the Minister, giving him outside advice? It seems from the report that the then Minister for Health and Children did not know what was going on in his Department, with certain advice not being passed on. So far it is the civil servants who are being accused of this. Very little has been said about the role of his advisers. It is not crystal clear where they fitted into all these events. This is an issue that needs to be cleared up. It is difficult to get anything from this report as to the role the Minister&rsquo;s advisers played in the Department of Health and Children during his tenure there. Perhaps they are responsible for not passing information on to him.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kelly has taken the rap for this. If he is to take the rap for maladministration in the Department and if he is the only person to take responsibility for this, does that basically mean that he is the person who was fully in charge of that Department and if that is the case, what role does the Minister have? Does he have any ministerial responsibility to his Department? We have read both the guidelines issued to him and the 1997 Act. At the end of the day, the former Minister, Deputy Martin, has full political responsibility for this issue which was raised every few months in the Department. I do not accept the former Minister, Deputy Martin, taking this issue back to 1976. There was a High Court case in 1975 followed by regulations in 1976. High Court advice was given to the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Health <Col N="952"/>in 1978, which was not acted upon. The heads of a Bill were brought forward by a Fine Gael Minister for Health, which were not acted on when Fianna F&aacute;il came back into power. We could easily go back prior to 2001 and lay much blame at the door of Fianna F&aacute;il Administrations, but we are looking at the irresponsibility of what happened in the Departments from that date on. Deputy Perry will expand on that issue. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, should appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to explain his role fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did the former Minister, Deputy Martin, need briefing on this very important Act given that after 2001 there was no doubt about the legislation despite a certain ambiguity in its interpretation before that date? The former Minister, Deputy Martin, is hiding behind civil servants. He launched the health strategy document which was a ten-year plan. The T&aacute;naiste has now inherited that plan without &euro;2 billion.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report of January 2001 clearly indicated difficulties with charges. The Ombudsman paid back &euro;25,000 in 2002 and &euro;20,000 in 2003. That was a clear marker. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, cannot hide behind civil servants.</P>
      <P>In regard to the liability, why is the former Minister, Deputy Martin, not taking full responsibility? I looked at this file dating back to 2001. The information was well known in the Department. Why is the former Minister, Deputy Martin, not taking the political responsibility which rests entirely with him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>If possible, I will try to share some of my time with Deputy McManus. In this very inadequate format, it is only possible to initiate this debate and the type of debate the Travers report warrants. The Taoiseach and his Government colleagues have engineered for themselves a head start and a clear run for a day or two in their attempts to manipulate public opinion on the Travers report but their distortions are becoming apparent.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Martin, is accountable for leaving the taxpayer with an invoice which, according to the T&aacute;naiste, might reach &euro;2 billion. If he knew the implications, he should resign because he is in dereliction of duty. If he did not know, given any fair reading of the Travers report, he should resign because he is incompetent. His two Ministers of State are without excuse or defence and must go.</P>
      <P>Before he escaped from the House, the Taoiseach contrived to leave the impression that several Ministers from Brendan Corish in 1976 share responsibility for this debacle. Travers shows that this is a familiar fabrication by the Taoiseach because only former Ministers, Mr. Haughey and Deputy Martin, are implicated in <Col N="953"/>the report. In fact, the Brendan Corish regulations, contrary to what the former Minister, Deputy Martin, just said, remain intact. It was the circular of 1976 issued by his officials which was wrong.</P>
      <P>There is only one exception to the Haughey-Martin involvement and that concerns the mystery surrounding why the proposals to legislate brought forward in 1987 by the former Minister, John Boland, and approved by Government, were not proceeded with by his successor. The Boland proposals would have saved the taxpayer hundreds of millions of euro. When I raised this crucial point this morning, the Ceann Comhairle seemed to suggest that he must decline the invitation to address the House because his office must not become involved in what he called &ldquo;controversy&rdquo;. We will have to return to that when we engage with this debate properly when the Taoiseach returns. There is no evidence in this report that former Ministers Cowen, Noonan, Howlin, Desmond and Woods were ever advised by the Department of this issue or its implications. The Taoiseach was deliberately misleading for outside effect.</P>
      <P>The legislation to extend the medical card to everybody over 70 years of age changed all that. It is unbelievable that when enacting the 2001 Act, the former Minister, Deputy Martin, did not know what he was doing. The Travers report states: &ldquo;The records made available to me indicate that the Department of Health and Children was, fairly immediately, aware of this consequence of the 2001 Act for the practice of charging in place since 1976 as described in earlier chapters of this report.&rdquo; The Department was fully aware, yet we are supposed to believe it never told the Minister. One must remember the report does not make a distinction, when referring to &ldquo;Department&rdquo;, as between officials and Minister. It is crystal clear the Department knew from 2001.</P>
      <P>Mr. Michael Kelly, the then Secretary General of the Department, claims he told the Minister twice about the matter and that, in all probability, he sent the file to the Minister and, as we know, a third party, another official, recalls seeing the file in the Minister&rsquo;s outer office. This would be perfectly compatible with the presence of the Minister&rsquo;s special adviser and policy adviser at the famous meeting of the management advisory committee, MAC, in the Gresham Hotel on 16 December 2003.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kelly says he &ldquo;can think of no reason why I would have sent it to any official in the Dept&rdquo;. In Civil Service, or in layman&rsquo;s English, when a senior civil servant says he can think of no reason he would have sent that file to any official, he means he sent it to the Minister. He goes on to say: &ldquo;However, given its potential consequences, my belief is that I would have brought it to the attention of the Minister in advance of issuing the letter.&rdquo; The Travers report does not draw con<Col N="954"/>clusions. It is a matter for this House to draw conclusions. The only plausible conclusion we can draw is that Mr. Kelly is being truthful. This would explain why the file was in the outer office of the Minister, and someone took a decision to keep it there.</P>
      <P>Given that we got the substance of what was in that file this morning from the T&aacute;naiste setting out the implications of this phenomenally important case, the most amazing thing about all this is that nobody ever asked whether the Attorney General ever gave advice on it. The former Minister, Deputy Martin, who was supposed to be in charge of the Department, never asked: &ldquo;By the way, did the Attorney General say our arse is out the window on this?&rdquo; It is completely improbable and entirely unbelievable.</P>
      <P>It is even more bizarre that at a subsequent meeting of the MAC on 29 March chaired by Mr. Kelly, it was recorded that: &ldquo;It was mentioned that the Department has sought legal advice in relation to long-stay charges issue&rdquo;, although no such legal advice was sought and nobody intervened to say it was not true. At the next meeting on 18 October, it was recorded &ldquo;that the legal options are still being reviewed&rdquo;. That meeting was also chaired by Mr. Kelly. It is almost beyond belief. It was reported to the two subsequent meetings of the MAC that advice was sought. This was 18 October. What did they think the Attorney General was doing? The Travers report states &ldquo;strikingly incorrect information appears to have been conveyed to the meetings by the Department&rdquo;. Mr. Kelly was in the chair. If he knew, he could have put it right. Did he believe the file had gone to the Attorney General? How could he have held such a belief when he knew he had not signed the letter to dispatch the file?</P>
      <P>In the interests of fairness it is necessary to say that no amount of huffing and puffing by the Association of Higher Civil Servants can get away from the fact that this is a baleful day in the history of the Civil Service, that this is a catalogue of error almost unrivalled, and that should be recorded. However, it is simply not credible that senior civil servants did not verbally bring the implications of this matter to the attention of the Minister. It is certainly not credible that at a minimum, after the South Eastern Health Board put the Department in possession of its legal advices to the effect that these charges were illegal, that was not mentioned to the Minister. Given the scale of the implications if the South Eastern Health Board was right, that we are asked to believe that senior conscientious civil servants did not bring that to the ear of the Minister beggars belief and cannot be accepted in this House.</P>
      <P>The Government is asking us to believe that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is personally insulated from responsibility in circumstances in which his two Ministers of State were present at and participated in the discussion, where his special adviser <Col N="955"/>and his policy adviser were present for the discussion concerned. It does not matter for how long the discussion went on. This was a major issue and the Minister was absent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will have to wait until another day for Deputy McManus&rsquo;s incisive contribution. I must finish this point.</P>
      <P>The Government would have us believe the former Minister for Health and Children is personally insulated in circumstances where his two Ministers of State were present, where his two advisers were present, where he had received an advance briefing paper, and where he had received the minutes afterwards, and that he knows nothing, like Manuel in &ldquo;Fawlty Towers&rdquo;. We are expected to believe he never read the advance briefing paper, that he never read the minutes when they issued, and that he knows nothing about it. Nobody who has ever served in Government would believe that is possible. It is entirely implausible, and I suspect the Minister Deputy Martin knows it.</P>
      <P>Political accountability in this case rests on two questions. First, did the former Minister for Health and Children know or could he reasonably have been expected to know of the problem of illegal charging for nursing home care? Second, if he knew, did he act at appropriate speed to close off the accumulating liability to the State? The only rational inference and answer in respect of the first question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that he knew. The answer to the second question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that he did not act. I use the phrase &ldquo;could reasonably have been expected to know&rdquo; advisedly. I do not believe a Minister can be expected to keep tabs on the location of every paper clip in his Department. However, I expect him to ask questions and to inform himself on crucial matters. This Minister would have us believe he did not do that. I cannot accept that.</P>
      <P>I am on record in this House and elsewhere as acknowledging the integrity of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children in political and other matters. The T&aacute;naiste, whether she likes it or not, mounted her white steed this morning and she is protected by a halo, a Colgate ring of protection that does not surround the rest of us. It is very important this House should know that it was Deputy John Perry and not the T&aacute;naiste who caused this matter to be investigated in the Department. When the T&aacute;naiste learned about it she compounded the original error by seeking to legislate to make it retrospectively legal. It is fair that should be recorded.</P>
      <P>When the T&aacute;naiste says she will not adjudicate as between the conflicting positions of Mr. Michael Kelly and the former Minister for Health <Col N="956"/>and Children, Deputy M&iacute;che&aacute;l Martin, she is evading her responsibility. She knows the implications and she ought to come down on one side or the other. As far as I am concerned, it is patently clear that Mr. Michael Kelly has quite properly taken the honourable course because there was failure on the part of the administrative Government, although I do not regard a sideways promotion to the HEA as much of a penalty.</P>
      <P>It is equally clear that there was even more gross dereliction of duty on the part of political Government and that the Minister proposes to take no such honourable course. This is a very bad day for accountability. I propose to send this report to Mr. David Blunkett as an illustration of what would happen if he were a Minister in this jurisdiction. He resigned from Government because he was accused of fast tracking an application for a non-national. If a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister did not fast track the application, he would probably lose his place in Government.</P>
      <P>The State is being exposed to a bill of what the T&aacute;naiste thinks might be &euro;2 billion and the Minister responsible seeks to tell us he knew nothing. That is simply not plausible. Unless he is accusing the civil servants of a conspiracy of silence there is no rational explanation. We know from the Travers report that they knew. Therefore, the Minister must be saying they conspired not to tell him. Does the Chair believe that? I certainly do not believe it, and there is only one honourable course for this Minister to take at the end of today&rsquo;s debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Connolly, Gormley and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
      <P>I have read the Travers report, including the various statements and conclusions. Nowhere in it can I find the answer to a very simple question. Why was this issue not addressed by simple legislation when it first came to light? Why was it allowed to roll on for 29 years without a definitive conclusion? The report does not provide the answer to that basic question. It finds that the Department of Health and Children failed over more than 28 years to deal effectively with the flawed legal foundation for charges levied on persons with full eligibility. The evidence provided in the report backs up that finding. Therefore, in accepting that finding it is logical to accept that there is blame to be laid at the desk of officials.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers says he finds no evidence to indicate the Minister was fully briefed. The political parties who are not in Government at this time have sought a political scapegoat. Apparently the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is the target. However, it must be recognised that this issue has been live since 1976. When the 1976 regulations were drawn up we had a Labour Minister for Health. Since that time we have had three other Labour Ministers for Health. During that 29 year period we have also had two Fine Gael Ministers for Health and seven <Col N="957"/>Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for Health. If the political blame game is to be played we have not just one political party in contention but three, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

	<P>A central point in this case is whether a Minister is to blame for inaction if he or she is not briefed by officials even though that Minister knew or should have known that a problem existed. It has been nauseating to witness people in this House engaging in manufactured hysteria since the issue arose, leading at one stage to calls for the T&aacute;naiste to resign, just because she did what nobody else did and brought the matter into the open.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcHughIND"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It was totally illogical and juvenile for any Member to adopt that stance on such a serious issue. This is a cock-up of monumental proportions, which must be faced up to. Those responsible must be brought to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. What we have is another fine mess and once again the taxpayer will be expected to foot the bill. It renders insignificant the fiasco of the electronic voting system which cost the country &euro;60 million with the taxpayer again picking up the bill. This time the bill is &euro;2 billion and rising. If this &euro;2 billion had been pumped into the health service it would have solved many of our problems, particularly those in accident and emergency departments and nursing home beds for years to come.</P>
      <P>What method of calculation will be used when the Health Service Executive pays back the money owed? Will it use the same method used when people owe money to the HSE? Between 1976 and 1987 the health boards used a compound interest rate of 7% per annum and from 1987 onwards they used 6% compound interest. To translate this into today&rsquo;s terms, £1 in 1976 is equivalent to &euro;9.42 now. This is why I feel the cost could well exceed &euro;2 billion.</P>
      <P>What will happen to the interest on patients&rsquo; savings and moneys used by the health boards in that period of time? As interest rates were very high, those amounts would have been substantial. The general answer was that money was used on patient comforts. We must have had the most comfortable patients in the world if that type of money was spent on them.</P>
      <P>A few examples of files going missing at critical times are the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Barron report, the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital where 40 files disappeared, the Dunne inquiry, the Moriarty tribunal and the time of the sterling devaluation. We also had the missing file concerning the paedophile and we <Col N="958"/>know what happened at that juncture. It is a wonderfully strange coincidence how files can go missing at vital times. Perhaps we should put tracking devices on files. The past 30 years of health administration smacks of the television comedy programme &ldquo;Yes, Minister&rdquo;. This issue will give new meaning to that programme for many people in future.</P>

	<P>The Travers report is an indictment of the administrative and political culture in the Department of Health and Children. It exposes a litany of poor decisions, fudges and errors as well as &ldquo;extreme maladministration&rdquo; as the T&aacute;naiste put it. By using that phrase she nicely prepared the way for this report. As I said at the time, it was preparing the way for civil servants to get it in the neck. Mr. Kelly has accepted his responsibility in the debacle. However, Government politicians have simply washed their hands. No one has assumed political responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems this is the pattern we now associate with the Government, with a series of Ministers brazening it out. Let us be clear, the T&aacute;naiste has supported the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. She has said she does not want to adjudicate on a conflict of evidence. However, this is entirely disingenuous because she has adjudicated. She has made it clear as to what side she is on. She is on the side of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Minister of State, Deputy Callely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and Tim O&rsquo;Malley. Did the T&aacute;naiste try to dissuade Mr. Kelly from going elsewhere? While she may smile about the matter, she accepted it because she wants to accept the version given to us by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. I ask the T&aacute;naiste to admit this is the truth today, as we need to have clarity on this point. She rowed in behind Fianna F&aacute;il on this matter as she has done on so many other occasions. I clearly recall her rowing in behind the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, saying that she had full confidence in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly she has full confidence in the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste should no longer ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to climb up lampposts with posters saying &ldquo;One-party Government &mdash; no thanks.&rdquo; It seems we now <Col N="959"/>have one-party Government. The Progressive Democrats is indistinguishable from Fianna F&aacute;il and I no longer know its purpose in Government. It has become obsolete &mdash; what is it doing there? Is it holding people to account? That party has shirked political responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, spoke of spin, but who are the masters of spin? I was at the launch of the 2001 health strategy. It was like a discotheque with all its blazing lights. The Minister claims we are making a mistake trying to distinguish between full eligibility and the question of legality and illegality. These are important points and the Minister was told about the matter. He was clearly told in 2001 when he issued medical cards to the over 70s. That was a nice bit of spin on the Minister&rsquo;s part. While he was criticised in the Brennan report about this matter, it was done because these are the people who vote and the Government parties reaped a harvest afterwards. In 2003, the Minister had the legal opinion from the former South Eastern Health Board. Is he claiming nobody knew about that matter? Of course people knew about it.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Health and Children was late for the meetings. Unfortunately, meetings are not good for spin. They are matters of substance that take place away from the media spotlight. As a result it would appear they were treated with a certain amount of disdain by the Minister. However, his Ministers of State and advisers were in attendance. The Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and Tim O&rsquo;Malley, told us they assumed the Minister, Deputy Martin, knew about the matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, said he had a conversation with the Taoiseach when going through the lobbies, which indicates the seriousness he attached to the subject. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, said he assumed it would happen as a matter of course. However, I have repeatedly asked about the follow up. These meetings were minuted and as is normal in such circumstances, matters arise. Did anyone ask what was happening with this matter? Did the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, ask what was happening with the legal opinion? As nobody asked the fundamental question there was a dereliction of duty. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will not assume his political responsibility for that debacle.</P>
      <P>Where do we go from here? Irreparable damage has been done to the relationship between Ministers and civil servants. Where do special advisers fit in? The T&aacute;naiste came to yesterday&rsquo;s meeting with her special advisers. I would like her to repair that damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Travers report is a massive indictment of successive Governments and successive Ministers for Health since 1976. It <Col N="960"/>is also an indictment of the ethos within the senior management at the Department of Health and Children in the same period. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children has, initially at least, tried to shift the responsibility onto the shoulders of civil servants. While senior civil servants clearly cannot be exonerated, it is beyond question that primary responsibility rests with the Ministers who are supposed to be responsible to the D&aacute;il and to the people.</P>
      <P>We are expected to believe that the former Secretary General at the Department of Health and Children, Mr. Michael Kelly, was the chief culprit in this matter and as a result he has been penalised by being moved out of the Department. However, as has already been stated, the Government has moved him to another senior and well paid position as the full-time chairperson of the Higher Education Authority, despite the OECD report having recommended an extensive public recruitment campaign for this position. This needs to be explained. If the Government considers this civil servant culpable, why did it not take steps to dismiss him as it is empowered to do? If he was not culpable or negligent, why was he moved or required to move? Does the Government fear that a dismissal, if it were challenged in open court, might further expose the responsibilities of Ministers in this debacle? Who does the Government hold responsible? If all senior civil servants for 30 years were responsible then no one was responsible.</P>
      <P>Has the T&aacute;naiste any indication of how many people had charges stopped because they complained? How many received refunds as a result of their complaints being processed? Does the T&aacute;naiste agree it is a scandal that charges were dropped for those who complained or who had somebody to complain on their behalf, while vulnerable and incapacitated people or those with disabilities, who had no knowledge of or ability to articulate their case and nobody to do so on their behalf, continued to face charges? Is it seriously suggested that, because charges were dropped in cases brought to the attention of the Department, the knowledge within the system did not make its way to ministerial attention over all those years? We must know how many cases were brought to the Department for determination and in respect of which charges were quietly dropped.</P>
      <P>The Travers report observes, &ldquo;Ministers should insist on full and periodic briefings on key issues of policy and operational performance&rdquo;. It is a scandal if Ministers did not do this in regard to the illegal charges. However, if they did so, we are clearly not being told the truth about the knowledge of successive Ministers for Health and Children. The report describes the illegal charging of people in care as the result of &ldquo;long term systemic corporate failure&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It beggars belief that this could have continued for almost 30 years and that successive Ministers failed to take action over the lack of a legal basis <Col N="961"/>for the charges. The report could not be clearer when it states the Department of Health and Children undertook &ldquo;many reviews&rdquo; of the charging practice over the years from 1976 to 2004. All these reviews concluded that the legal basis for the charges was at the very least uncertain and should be rectified by the introduction of amending legislation.</P>
      <P>Even more disturbing are the wider implications of this report for the running of the health services over the last three decades. In this regard, I wish to highlight an important conclusion of the report and one that has received little attention. This goes to the heart of why this situation was allowed to continue for so long. As a former member of a health board, I am certain this is the case. The report makes findings about why it took from 1976 until 2004 for the Department of Health and Children to request legal advice from the Attorney General. Among the underlying reasons it finds &ldquo;a strong desire to protect what was regarded as an important source of &lsquo;own income&rsquo; by the health boards as a means of protecting the provisions of essential health services in a health system widely regarded as being underfunded&rdquo;. The import of that statement is very serious. The underfunding of health services by successive Governments contributed to the belief within the system that the illegal charges as a source of funding for health boards should not be threatened. It was judged better to continue to charge people illegally than to take the necessary decisions to increase revenue for the health system, to reform it and to organise public health services on a more equitable and efficient basis. This is a damning report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That brings to a conclusion the time for formal statements. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, shall now each take questions for a period not exceeding 30 minutes. I will try to accommodate all Members who wish to contribute so I ask that questions be concise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the T&aacute;naiste believe is the appropriate outcome of this matter in terms of political accountability? Will she clarify the contents of the briefing notes given to the three Ministers and does she have any plans to release those briefing notes? Will the T&aacute;naiste clarify the statement in her speech that the &ldquo;administrative culture of any Department is influenced by the style and leadership of its political head&rdquo;? This is the Department the T&aacute;naiste has described as systemically maladministered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my remarks, Ministers are accountable through the Oireachtas for their Departments and they must accept this accountability. Secretaries General are accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for their <Col N="962"/>Department&rsquo;s Vote. There are, therefore, clear lines of accountability. I will ask the Department to make available the briefing notes received by the three Ministers. I have no problem with making information available. As the Deputy knows, all such information was provided to Mr. Travers.</P>
      <P>As politicians, we all engage in cat calls across the floor of the House. Perhaps we are all subjective to such an extent that when a report does not say what we would like it to say, we are inclined to put things into it that are not there. I hope I am a person who is fair in regard to any decisions I have made and any judgments to which I have come. I assure Members I have certainly sought to be extremely fair in regard to these matters. I am not into scapegoating anybody, particularly public servants.</P>
      <P>The report is very clear in regard to its conclusions. It states, for example, that Ministers can be faulted for not probing more deeply. However, it continues by observing that these shortcomings were of a scale, substance and order of magnitude considerably less than those of the system of public administration. That is the finding of Mr. Travers. The report further states that the fundamental reason for the period of time that elapsed from 1976 until October 2004, when the Attorney General was asked for advice, lies in &ldquo;long-term systemic corporate failure&rdquo; and that this failure is &ldquo;principally a failure of public administration which, essentially, failed to identify, recognise and acknowledge&rdquo; the situation. I do not get any pleasure in saying this. As I said yesterday, I have had the pleasure over the last five months of working with committed, professional and thorough civil servants in the Department of Health and Children. I want to work with them to put in place the excellent recommendations in this report.</P>
      <P>Mr. Travers is a man of enormous integrity with whom many Members from all sides of the House have worked in various roles in different Departments and organisations. These are his conclusions based on what he saw, was told and discovered. We must be decent enough to accept them and to make changes where such are required. That is what I want do because, above all else, we must look to the future in regard to many of these issues. We all accept this situation is a total mess. The consequences are considerable, involving 315,000 people and going back to 1976. Some institutions are closed and no records exist. Besides the huge amount of money involved, this issue represents a mammoth task from an administrative and logistical point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys _ic20-?><Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste accept the Travers report does not say it is solely an issue of administration and that there is clearly political responsibility in this matter? Does she accept, for example, that any Minister has enormous powers and supports and always gets cre<Col N="963"/>dit when he or she is successful but that there is also an onus on Ministers to accept and bear responsibility when there is negligence and failure? Is this a principle the T&aacute;naiste takes seriously?</P>
      <?oasys _ic0-?><TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste says she is open to the publication of information. Will she publish the legal opinions in respect of this issue, particularly that of the South Eastern Health Board? It would be useful to see what information was available to the latter. Is there any record in her Department as to why the Minister for Health and Children who took over in March 1987, Dr. Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon, decided not to proceed with legislation that had been prepared by his predecessor, Mr. John Boland? Presumably that information is still in her Department. It is important to know what the story is regarding that decision, considering the size of the bill the taxpayer is left to pay so many years later.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.3-?>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Ministers have enormous powers and resources, and I accept the principle of political accountability, as I said in my earlier comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Not in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I only know what I was told, or what I was not told, and I will be accountable for myself. I was appointed on 29 September and I went to the Department on 30 September. I was briefed extensively and so on. This issue arose in the House, for which I have given credit to Deputies Perry and Kenny, and that is how I got to make inquiries of the Attorney General. I have acknowledged that many times and I am sure the Deputies opposite will agree that, as I said earlier, hopefully, I am fair.</P>
      <P>I asked for a report to be done on this issue and I brought it to Government on 14 December. It gives me no pleasure to say that it was not accurate &mdash; it was not complete and that was the basis on which we made decisions, including the one on retrospection. That is why I appointed Mr. Travers because I learnt the next day that a crucial piece of information was not included in that report. That is why I asked Mr. Travers to carry out his investigation and that is why certain other things happened. It is not a case of somebody being scapegoated for 28 years of maladministration, it is for different issues. Information was withheld from the Government and from me, and that is not acceptable to me. The legal opinions, if available, are opinions of health boards. I understand they were widely available to members of those health boards, both the 1987 opinion of the Eastern Health Board and the subsequent opinion &mdash; I understand there were many in between &mdash; of the South Eastern Health Board, but they belong to those bodies, subject to legal advice. The relevant parts of those <Col N="964"/>opinions are quoted in the report. In the document we released this morning that went to the Attorney General in October, the background note refers quite extensively to the opinion of the South Eastern Health Board, but subject to legal advice I do not have a difficulty in making the opinions available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste has not answered the question I asked on records in her Department concerning an extraordinary decision to abandon the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no records apparently in my Department, according to Mr. Travers. He got these records from the Department of Finance. He got the two memoranda to Government. It is a fact that in the report that on 5 February the late John Boland took a memorandum to Government. A memorandum was put to John Boland, who was the caretaker Minister as the Labour Party had withdrawn from Government, to implement the decisions of the budget. That budget brought in the concept of inpatient charges which had to be legislated for. In the context of that memorandum, he apparently, in his own handwriting, stated he wanted to include this. From where the knowledge for that came I do not know, but he wanted to include this. The Government agreed to the drafting of legislation accordingly.</P>
      <P>The election was held a few days later and a new Government came in. The same memorandum was brought back to the new Government in March of that year. The decision was proceeded with in terms of the budgetary decision. There is a note on the Government decision that apparently states &ldquo;proceed as relevant&rdquo;. Mr. Travers refers to the &ldquo;pinks&rdquo;, the notes that the Secretary General to the Government takes, which are not the formal Government decision. They note that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health were to meet to review this issue. That is the end of the paper trail and that is all I can tell the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I read the Official Report subsequently on that legislation and although Fine Gael proposed this legislation, it voted against it and the new Government took it through the D&aacute;il. There are many things we all learn from this process. The Government that had signed off on this ended up in opposition opposing it, something on which we could all reflect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The T&aacute;naiste said that she wanted to be fair and truthful, and I would like her to be both when she answers my questions. Is it not the case that having expressed full confidence in the Minister, Deputy Martin, at the same time she is expressing no confidence in Mr. Kelly, and that by accepting his move to another Department she is expressing no confidence in him?</P><Col N="965"/>
      <P>On another matter, the State faces a major bill of up to &euro;2 billion. Will the Minister inform the House how she expects to raise that money? The Minister for Finance is sitting beside her and perhaps he could tell her. Are we looking at cuts in the health service? Yesterday the Minister said that she wanted more resources for her Department. I would like her to let us all know how she expects to raise them because this is probably the most serious issue at this stage.</P>
      <P>Where do special advisers fit into the scheme of things? The Minister, like other Ministers, has surrounded herself with special advisers. Some of them were with her at the health committee yesterday. What responsiblity do these people have and to whom are they answerable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer those questions in reverse order if that is agreeable to the Deputy. Special advisers are responsible to me to give me outside independent advice. They are not to supplement the advice I get from civil servants, they are to help me come forward with alternative views or perspectives. They are not a substitute for the Minister. It is not the case that it is appropriate that special advisers either clear parliamentary questions or clear &ldquo;what the Minister should or should not do&rdquo;. The Minister must make those decisions. The buck rests with the Minister, not with the special advisers.</P>
      <P>My special advisers are accountable to me and they work very well, as they did in my previous Department, and, hopefully, as they will in this one, with the civil servants. They work in a team-like way. They are not part of the management of the Department, they do not go to the management meetings in the Department. Mr. Travers makes recommendations in that regard. Different Ministers have different perspectives. I do not attend management meetings, nor did I do so in the previous Department. I believe that is the role of the management in the Department, although we have policy meetings with officials and so on.</P>
      <P>On the question of more resources, the Department of Health and Children is constantly getting more resources. I said yesterday that the new role for the Department will be a policy legislative standards role and the Health Service Executive will have the delivery accountability function of the health services. In that new role we must organise resources and we need to put resources into different areas. By more resources I mean we need to beef up certain aspects of the Department to give it more strength in certain key areas where it has huge responsibilities, particularly in respect of legislation. Currently, we are working on several Bills in the Department in respect of medical practitioners, nurses, other health care professionals, pharmacy legislation, health information and so on. There are so many areas and it is a mammoth, onerous task for a Department. In our new role I want to put more resources into <Col N="966"/>that area. It is about moving resources around and it may be about additionality as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>From where will the T&aacute;naiste get the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>It is about organising the money as well and having certain priorities. It is not always about getting more and more money. We all know the health budget increases by approximately 10% a year, and that is the case this year.</P>
      <P>On the cost of this measure &mdash; we know what the parameters of the cost could be &mdash; there is no sum of money sitting around that we can take and say, &ldquo;there it is&rdquo;. I have said previously that if the sum were &euro;500 million it would build two new hospitals. If it were &euro;2 billion it would build a new children&rsquo;s hospital, a Mater hospital and several other hospitals. That is what we are talking about. To put it in scale, it is a huge amount of money.</P>
      <P>In regard to confidence, I said previously and I repeat that if I did not have confidence in one of my Cabinet colleagues I would go to the Taoiseach and say that. I would not stay in government with somebody in whom I did not have confidence. When I have confidence in people I defend them, even when it might be unpopular to do so. I stand by people, and that is important too.</P>
      <P>In regard to Mr. Kelly, he is a bright, hard-working, committed civil servant. That is my view of Mr. Kelly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

	<P>Do the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Martin, accept that successive Governments let down the elderly, stabbed them in the back and ripped them off over the years? The Minister, Deputy Martin, told the House today:</P>
      <P LI="1">During my time as Minister for Health and Children the record will show that I was fully accessible to staff and willing to address issues even at the shortest of notice. At no time did I shy away from sensitive issues because they might have cost implications or reflect badly on Governments.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Many Deputies feel the Minister did shy away from such issues, as did the Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and Tim O&rsquo;Malley. I refer in particular to the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who was responsible for the elderly at the time. I remind the Minister and the Ministers of State that the Constitution states that Ministers should have ultimate responsibility. There have been serious problems in this regard for many years. Successive Governments have let the elderly down. I demand political accountability. Will the Minister accept responsibility for the actions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no problem with accepting accountability for my actions in respect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FinianMcGrath"><NameTxt>Mr. F. McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>What about responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made it clear that I will do that now and in the future. The Deputy should ask the Minister, Deputy Martin, about his accessibility. I think he is very accessible. Questions about the Minister should be directed to him, to be fair to all of us, including him, and to the House. I do not doubt that political responsibility has to be accepted when political errors are made.</P>

	<P>One hears a great deal about what various people did and did not know. The T&aacute;naiste said earlier:</P>
      <P LI="1">Most unfortunately, the Government&rsquo;s decisions on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 were based on inaccurate and incomplete information. The Attorney General&rsquo;s advice in advance of that decision was based in part on poor, inaccurate and incomplete information.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The T&aacute;naiste knew there was a major problem when she was preparing the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why did she introduce retrospective legislation, the net effect of which was to deprive elderly people of their entitlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill was introduced for a number of reasons. As I have said in this House, I believe we were acting in good faith when we decided to introduce the Bill. In other words, there was no legal knowledge in the Department of Health and Children that the matter was unconstitutional and did not have a safe legal basis. That is a fact. If one reads the opinion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It is at the back of the Travers report. It was during the Christmas holiday break that the Keane judgment came to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>We advised the T&aacute;naiste not to go ahead with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said in my speech, the discovery process for the Supreme Court hearings started in parallel with the discovery process for the Travers report. I remember getting a call and being told about the Keane judgment. I was surprised to hear that the Government had been advised in such strong terms in 1978 that this was wrong. As a result, the State did not argue in the Supreme Court case that it had acted in good faith. The advice given to me by the Attorney General was based on his belief that we were acting in good faith.</P>
      <P>I was also asked about retrospection. Of course I wanted to try to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money by making this legal retrospectively and going forward. The Supreme Court made it clear that the legislation was not struck down on the basis of retrospection, or on the basis of Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution. It was struck down because the Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to take away people&rsquo;s property rights without compensating them. The only circumstances in which it would be constitutional to do that would be if it were to cause a disequilibrium in the public finances. The Supreme Court took the view that the sum of money involved would not cause such difficulty in the public finances. given the current state of the economy. The legislation was struck down on the basis of property rights and not on the basis of retrospection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the T&aacute;naiste agree that if one had read section 1 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, one would not need to be a legal expert to understand that the charges were illegal? Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report of January 2001, which stated that the charges being imposed on elderly people at the time were completely illegal? I refer also to the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Why did the Government ignore the advice of two constitutional officers of the State? The Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General put down clear markers about the illegal charges. The Government&rsquo;s estimate of the number of people who would be affected by changes to the provisions in respect of people over the age of 70 was inaccurate. The State&rsquo;s estimate of the number of applicants was wrong by approximately 50,000 and its estimate of the cost was wrong by approximately &euro;40 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman had put down clear markers in this regard. Why did the Government fail to act?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="970"/>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Travers report makes clear that the foundation decision was taken in 1976 and not in 2002, although it points out that things were brought into focus in 2002. The commission on health funding drew attention to the matter in the late 1980s, as did the health strategy of 1994. The Department received legal advice on the issue in 1975-76. As Mr. Travers states in his report, a great deal of legal advice was received suggesting that the charges were wrong. He said he could not find any substantive advice to suggest it could be done. That is the reality. Mr. Travers acknowledged that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report dealt with the issue of nursing home subvention, which is related, but not the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a separate case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Litigation is pending in that regard. When this matter arose last December, I asked the assistant secretary of the Department, Mr. Smyth, to conduct an audit of the regulations which impose charges so that a legal opinion on their status could be acquired. That audit is under way and will be finalised as quickly as possible. We have been working extremely hard on it. Meetings will be held with officials from the Office of the Attorney General about many other regulations which have been made under various Acts.</P>
      <P>Many people felt that all of this could have been dealt with in the entitlement and eligibility legislation. The Travers report acknowledges that an official in the Department drafted the heads of such a Bill, which I subsequently used here. As Mr. Travers states, that process was commenced but was then parked. The heads of the Bill were to be used in a further, wider Bill, rather than in a stand-alone Bill. I do not suggest that people were not worried about issues relating to entitlement and eligibility, but there was a view that such matters could be dealt with in the manner I have outlined.</P>
      <P>The sad reality is that the principle has broad support. I doubt that many Members of the House do not support the principle that people should make a contribution towards their shelter and maintenance if they can afford to do so, just as people in the community do. The difficulty is that we did not have a legal basis for taking such contributions for 28 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the T&aacute;naiste indicate the number of people whose charges were stopped because they complained? That information is important because it relates to the issue of who knew what and when. Given that the information would help to identify certain processes, has the T&aacute;naiste made inquiries in that regard within the Department? Has she tried to ascertain the methodology of assessment of the complaints? Where were decisions taken when people complained that the charges should no longer apply? I doubt that such decisions were <Col N="971"/>taken at health board level. If advice was ultimately received at health board level, it must have resulted initially from a referral to the Department. That must have happened on a repeated basis and at a high level. If charges were being stopped in some instances because those who made complaints had certain information, or had a sufficient level of belief in the case they presented effectively or the case that was presented effectively on their behalf, it is incredible that this was not known by senior officials in the Department, the Minister and Ministers of State.</P><P>I would like to know not only the number of cases but whether the Minister has checked the dates on which they were presented and terminated. This would inform us who was at the helm of the Department when each case arose. I have no idea how many cases there are. Were retrospective refunds paid in any or all of them? Will the Minister address this sincerely? In light of all that has arisen, has she sought the information personally to inform herself on who knew what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take Deputy Healy&rsquo;s question because there are only three minutes remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Minister for Health and Children sought and received legal advice on the eligibility of elderly medical card holders who have been forced into private nursing homes due to the unavailability of beds in public hospitals or nursing homes or because they have been refused such beds? Is there another time-bomb ticking in the Department regarding this issue? Are the Minister and the Department sticking their heads in the sand in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s question, I do not know the precise number of cases. I did say &mdash; this is in the report &mdash; that anyone who challenged the making of the payments did not have to pay. The advice from the Department to the health board was not to pursue the matter legally. When invited by the registrar of the wards of court to pursue it legally, the Department&rsquo;s advice was that this should not be done.</P>
      <P>I do not know the numbers and this clearly creates another issue of inequality. Those who took legal advice or got somebody to take it on their behalf did not pay while those who were not so lucky paid. This is extraordinary.</P>
      <P>One will see in the documents published this morning that the line is advanced and that the Department was fearful of pursuing legal action for fear of the outcome. It believed it would not succeed. I do not know the numbers involved, nor do I know if there is a way to obtain them. However, if I can do so, I will.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Healy&rsquo;s question, there is legal advice on the matter raised.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="972"/>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the refunds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know whether people were refunded if they had been paying for a couple of years. I will revert to the Deputy on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>At what level were the decisions taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>They were certainly not charged going forward. I am not in a position to state whether they were refunded.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Healy&rsquo;s question, legal advice was obtained on the nursing home subvention. Where people are in public beds or in beds contracted by a public authority in a private nursing home the State is exposed. However, issues arise regarding the nursing home subvention. In this regard, one should bear in mind the answer I gave on the audit being conducted by Mr. Smith and the work he is doing with the Attorney General on the other regulations. We are seeking the advice of the Attorney General and doing a considerable amount of work regarding other regulations to determine whether they are legally safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Has specific advice been obtained on private beds in private nursing homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Is the Deputy referring to the nursing home subvention? Nobody could expect us to pay for every private bed in a private nursing home environment. I assure the Deputy this would cause financial disequilibrium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making the point that quite a substantial number&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of elderly patients with medical cards are not well-off. They are forced into private nursing homes because there are no beds available or because they have not been available in public hospitals and homes. They are in severe financial difficulty as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of that and it is on that issue that the advice has been sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>That concludes questions to the Minister for Health and Children. We will now proceed to questions for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for which 30 minutes have been allowed. I call on Deputy Twomey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should note that we responded to Mr. Travers. We said we had nothing to add other than what is already in the public domain. If that was not acceptable to Mr. <Col N="973"/>Travers and put into the submission, it had nothing to do with our views on this issue.</P>
      <P>What does the Minister believe a briefing entails, making specific reference to the briefing notes he was due to have received the day before the meeting in December 2003 and the briefing he received on the day and the day thereafter? Although the Minister stated he received a briefing, he is not crystal clear about what he knew about these charges.</P>
      <P>How did the Minister feel about the charges? Did he regard them as a matter of concern? What does he believe to be the meaning of political accountability? I asked the T&aacute;naiste the latter question and she did not answer very clearly. She stated there was systemic maladministration in the Department and that maladministration was due to the administrative culture in the Department, which is very much related to the political head of the Department. What is the view of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this?</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister about the role of his advisers when he was Minister for Health and Children and whether they acted as a buffer between himself and civil servants. What is his view on this?</P>
      <P>The health boards submitted legal advice to the Minister stating the charges were illegal but they continued charging a number of patients. However, payments were stopped in respect of patients who challenged the charges. Has the Minister legal advice on the position of some of the officials in the health boards? There are potential criminal charges involved if the officials continued to charge patients in the knowledge that the charges were illegal.</P>
      <P>The Travers report states the memorandum prepared for the Government was parked in both 2002 and 2003 pending legislation to tie up all the eligibility criteria. How much did the Minister know about this at the time? This was the time of the over-70s legislation and the health strategy, with which he was very closely associated. This strategy led to the establishment of the HSE, with which Mr. Kelly was very closely associated. Mr. Kelly and senior officials in the Department felt the strategy represented the way forward for the Department for many years. They knew of all the administrative problems that were occurring. However, it just took so long to have them sorted out that we have ended up in the mess in which we now find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked what I would consider to be a proper briefing. Mr. Travers has described it very succinctly in his report. It is nothing unusual or extraordinary. A sufficient briefing is fundamentally an analysis of a particular issue, an outline of the options a Minister could potentially pursue consequent on that analysis and recommendations by whoever is making the report on what the Minister should <Col N="974"/>do. That, in essence, is what most people would understand to be a proper briefing on an issue of this substance and importance. Mr. Travers makes the point that at no stage, having gone through all the documentation covering over 28 years, did he come across such an analysis.</P>
      <P>On the management advisory committee meeting, it is stated in the Travers report that the briefing documentation was e-mailed to the ministerial office or the outer office on the evening prior to that meeting. He has described my explanation &mdash; I did not read that particular documentation &mdash; as entirely and highly &ldquo;credible and understandable&rdquo;. I would not have been in Dublin the evening before the meeting. I could have driven up late that evening or flown up the following morning. I would have gone straight to a Cabinet meeting on the day in question and perhaps had a quick bite to eat thereafter. I would have gone to meet the American ambassador thereafter and then straight to the management advisory committee meeting.</P>
      <P>It is interesting what Mr. Travers says about the management advisory committee meeting. He actually describes it as a missed opportunity to brief me. One should remember that the legal opinion was with the Department for nine months prior to the meeting. There was plenty of time and sufficient opportunity to prepare the kind of briefing document I have described. Unfortunately that did not happen. I could have been briefed specifically on that issue well in advance of the management advisory committee meeting. I would like to recreate the atmosphere of that meeting. This was not flagged as a substantive issue. There were no alarm bells ringing about this either in advance of, or around, the meeting.</P>
      <P>The key item on the agenda, on which several people briefed me, was the health reform programme. A couple of months later we were to set up the new health structures and the Health Service Executive. That had implications for the contracts for chief executive officers of health boards who were somewhat annoyed at the lack of progress in reassuring them about their future and the future of staff across health board administrations. That was the central concern. I was briefed to tell the chief executive officers there was a future for them in the health service.</P>
      <P>Immediately after that meeting a further meeting was held with the chief executive officer of the Mid-Western Health Board to discuss the composition of the board that would be charged with implementing the Hanly proposals in the mid-west because we were concerned about certain proposals made by the health board on that issue. I remember that very clearly. They were the core issues. The other six items on the agenda were for brief mention only. No objective analysis of the agenda would give an impression that this was a substantial issue.</P><Col N="975"/>
      <P>Political accountability entails coming into this House to answer questions and to account for one&rsquo;s time in office, which is critical, as well as taking responsibility for issues about which one knew and with which one was in a position to deal. The Opposition talked about maladministration. For years people have known about the difficulties in running the health services, the great pressure on staff in the Department of Health and Children and the almost daily need to react to events. I know this more than most because I was there for four years, nine months.</P>
      <P>I was the first Minister in over 30 years to try to restructure that in line with the leadership of the Administration at that time. Flowing from the health strategy of 2001 we made a clear decision to look at how we structure and deliver health services. That gave rise to the Prospectus report which said the service should be changed to create a national delivery system, remove much of the operational detail from the Department and develop a more strategic framework with clear functions for the Department.</P>
      <P>I attempted to alleviate pressure on the health service, a problem that had been known for a long time. It is in train and I set up the Health Service Executive on an interim basis and abolished the health boards, which we debated in the House. That was my role in dealing with the pressures under which people worked.</P>
      <P>The Travers report refers to the parking of issues. I discussed the concept of eligibility in my speech. I was briefed regularly during and after the health strategy to the effect that our society needed to take a comprehensive look at its eligibility framework. For example, if one reads that document there is no clear framework for access to a range of community services, such as, dietary advice, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy etc. It was necessary to create a modern statutory framework covering the full range of eligibility across all the areas, including private nursing homes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Healy alluded to some of the issues that emerged consistently in that respect. A sub-group formed as part of the health strategy to look at eligibility produced a document. The group included Department officials, members of the National Economic and Social Forum, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, UCD, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul etc.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that but there were approximately nine questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has answered nothing yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly and we want an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be accused subsequently of not having answered a particular question. This is an important point. The sub-group asked what we should do about eligibility over the next ten years. In its report it noted that according to the Department the terms &ldquo;eligibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; are legally distinct. The Health Act 1970 provides for eligibility for a service but not that a person is entitled to receive a service. One is eligible when one qualifies to avail of services without charge or subject to prescribed charges. It continues with references to the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report and so on. Not even the various people on the sub-group on eligibility flagged this issue. No one said something illegal had been happening for 28 years that needed to be corrected and rectified.</P>
      <P>This report fed into the health strategy. The same happened in the 1994 health strategy. Deputy Rabbitte tried to wipe all that out with one grand gesture, to forget the past. I am not suggesting that Deputy Howlin knew anything about this, quite the contrary, but one cannot apply two standards. The 1994 strategy stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>This is now a 12 minute speech. It is total blather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that those in Government care were governed by inadequate legislation. It also stated the principle was accepted that those in long-term care should contribute to the cost of their maintenance from their incomes but the legislation gave rise to anomalies and inequities in these charges. It promised to amend the legislation to provide a clearer and fairer basis for these contributions.</P>

	<P>I ask the Minister not to filibuster when answering my question. Was he not in a unique position? The Supreme Court pointed out that in 2001 when he introduced a change in legislation the issue became clear beyond doubt. He is not like any other Minister who served in that Department.</P>
      <P>While we accept that the Minister did not receive a comprehensive briefing it is impossible for us to accept that he was unaware of the seriousness of the issue. Is it not possible to send briefing materials to the Minister by e-mail? Is he saying that Michael Kelly was not telling the truth when he stated that he spoke to the Minister on the day of the management advisory committee meeting and that he briefed the Minister on the issues including the nursing home charges? When was the Minister aware of the South Eastern Health Board legal opinion? Did he have no knowledge of that? Following the management advisory committee meeting, did he speak to the policy adviser and special adviser or his Ministers of State on this issue, all of whom had information? He was surrounded by people who were informed. Was he somehow cocooned from the information circulating around him, that he can now maintain he did not know about the seriousness of the issue?</P>

	<P>It is important that I have the opportunity to put this on the record because the reference to the 2001 Act is in that context. Only if I knew about the illegal device of the 1976 circular could I have known the full impact of the 2001 legislation.</P>

	<P>The Supreme Court made its decision just last month. It states that circular 76 and the regulations were illegal from 1976 onwards.

	<P>He goes on to state that the 2001 Act had the unintended effect of ultimately unwittingly forcing a resolution of the issue. Obviously that was not the intention.

	<P>I was aware of the eligibility issue. We had to make a choice in 2004 in terms of the Health Service Act versus this major Act on eligibility. However, I was not specifically aware of any illegality in regard to long-stay charges. In respect of my special advisers, the same principle applies to them in that their role is to advise me. They are not, and never were, a buffer zone between my officials and me. This is not how things operated.</P>

	<P>He does not say that in the draft section in the body of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>He said he briefed the Minister on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not casting aspersions on the integrity of any individual, nor do I intend to do so. I gave my perspective to Mr. Travers, as did others. He drew his conclusions from the various statements and discussions people had with him. I ask the House to consider subsequent events. There was a management meeting with the CEOs on 29 March, to which Deputy Rabbitte alluded. Apparently it is reported in the minutes that it had gone to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. If one will fast forward to October 2004, the minutes of that meeting state &mdash; this was in response to the CEOs of the health boards actively raising the issue &mdash; that the legal issues are being reviewed. Add to that scenario that the T&aacute;naiste, on taking office, was not briefed in any shape or form on this issue, which is meant to be of significant importance, substance and so on. I will leave the matter rest at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister give the House his precise recollection of the meeting which took place on 10 March? We would like to hear his accurate recollection of that meeting. In regard to the minutes of the meeting of 16 December 2003, did the Minister discuss these minutes at any stage with his junior Ministers? Did he read the minutes thoroughly and did he take on board what they stated? Did it not occur to him or his junior Ministers that there might be a requirement for a follow-up to find out exactly where was legal opinion on this important matter?</P>
      <P>Did the Minister meet regularly his junior Ministers? Did he meet them once a week or how did things operate? I do not know precisely the type of relationship that exists with junior Ministers, or what was their precise role? Clearly they appear to have fallen down on informing the Minister about this meeting.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="980"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They have clear responsibilities as laid down in the instruments by which they are appointed and they are given clear delineated functions. This has increased in recent years in terms of giving specific functions and specific policy areas to Ministers of State. Generally one tends to let Ministers get on with their job. One does not interfere regularly in their sphere of activities. There may be an overlap in some areas of the Department of Health and Children, or any other Department for that matter.</P>
      <P>I did not have discussions with them about the minutes in the aftermath of the meeting. I have already said that immediately after the meeting there was another meeting in the Gresham Hotel in connection with the Hanly report. This may explain why there was no discussion about the main meeting. I went straight into another meeting, on the margins of the room, with the chief executive of the health board and officials of the Department to discuss the Hanly report, which was a fairly hot topic at the time. The item under discussion was the composition of the implementation board in the mid-west.</P>
      <P>I cannot recollect whether I read the draft minutes because they would normally have gone to the next MAC meeting. At that stage, most people would have expected that the operational decisions, or other decisions made at the meeting, would have been followed on and moved on to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. Some 13 items were included, six of which were for brief mention only, including this item. From what I learned subsequently, the discussion was of approximately ten minutes duration. This does not suggest that the issue raised the kind of alarm bells that were on the radar screen to the extent that people are trying to suggest with hindsight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not answer the question about his precise recollections of the meeting of 10 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy reads the Travers report, there were two meetings on 10 March. There was one meeting at 9.30 a.m. to discuss the new units. The Deputy may recall that there were difficulties trying to open new units at the time, which caused a lot of pressure. I met the officials at approximately 9.30 a.m. I had hourly meetings that day, up to approximately 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>In the official published diary, there was no meeting scheduled with the Secretary General on the business plan. In the manuscript version of the diary, there is an insertion in handwriting which suggests that the meeting was sought that day to sign off on the business plan. The business plan consists of 400 odd pages. As I said to Mr. Travers, I do not recollect any discussion at that particular meeting of the kind mentioned in the Secretary General&rsquo;s speech. Furthermore, during the preparation and consideration of the Health Service Executive Bill, no proposals ever came to <Col N="981"/>me that legislation relating to this matter should be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Minister consulted, advised or aware at any time of the cases of those who complained and had their charges stopped? Will he accept that if he had even an inkling of such cases, it should have alerted him to the fact that something was seriously wrong with the whole matter of the application of charges for people in long-term nursing home care?</P>
      <P>Given that the T&aacute;naiste, as the new Minister for Health and Children, indicated that she has inherited a Department that has been cursed by systemic maladministration, and referring back to a point made earlier by another speaker, is the Minister concerned about her comments yesterday in committee that she would not adjudicate in the matter? Yet, in her delivery today, she stated very clearly that she recognises that the administrative culture in any Department is influenced by the style and leadership of its political head. Is there not a serious question over the Minister&rsquo;s position and term in office inherent in what the T&aacute;naiste said here this afternoon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer in regard to complaints is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. This was not a major issue in terms of people coming to us in advice centres. The big issue, as the Deputy will agree, is private nursing home charges and the difference between the nursing home subvention and the cost people must pay. If I was to say what was significant judging by the barometer of the people coming to my advice centres on a regular basis, that remains a core issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am asking the question of the Minister, not his advice centre.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>At what level would decisions like that be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>According to Mr. Travers they were taken at health board level going back to 1978 and the registrar of wards. That is what Mr. Travers&rsquo;s report says, that the health boards were advised not to contest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure that was referred up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise that at any stage. I mentioned the private nursing home charges as a major issue. I said repeatedly that eligibility in so far as it relates to elderly people, people with disabilities, and geography is a huge question the political system is facing. We know in terms of how private nursing care has evolved and people&rsquo;s access to services that there is a huge difference between what happened in Dublin and the rest of the country over the past ten or 15 years, there is a huge anomaly in the system. That was the whole reason we set up the Health Service Executive, to achieve national uniformity on eligibility so that the elderly person in Limerick who may be getting &euro;150 or &euro;200 can now have the same treatment and services as a person living in Dublin. We have all known that in this House since the Act dealing with nursing home subventions was put in place in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister answer my second question? Does he accept that if he had any inkling of those cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the Deputy&rsquo;s list of questions. On the system of maladministration, there are and have been excellent officials in the Department of Health and Children. It is the one Department that is, as Mr. Travers says, distinguishable from any other Department in terms of its workload and pressures and the way it reacts to a variety of issues within always finite and determined financial constraints. That must be placed on the record. I accept that I was an active Minister who probably tested even more in terms of workload. During my tenure, the Department looked at a range of issues right across the board and at a fundamental reform programme of the system itself. The workload we gave the Department in terms of the health reform programme and Hanly, which were basically a complete revamp, was never appreciated externally, before we add on all the other issues that were dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>We would not call it reform in Monaghan under the Minister&rsquo;s tenure, with all respect, as I told him many times.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="983"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an important point to place on the record of the House because there have been excellent achievements by the Department of Health and Children right across the board over many years and in recent times as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister received a brief on 3 December and did not read it. The Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, saw its significance. Does the Minister regret not having read that brief in light of the huge impact it had? I am totally shocked at the replies we have heard today with regard to what was known. If the Minister did not know, why was that the case? Was it necessary to get legal advice on something that was so apparent to the Ombudsman from January 2001? Why can the Minister not state it clearly? Continuing liability was discussed when medical cards for over-70s were being introduced. I do not believe what I am hearing. This was known in the Department and I am astonished that the Minister can stand here and state clearly that he did not know. When he got a brief in December 2003, he did not read it. Why was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister state clearly to the House when he knew first about this enormous problem? Did any Member of the House raise this issue with him? When did he become aware of the decision to seek definitive legal advice? Was it only when the Secretary General briefed him at the Gresham Hotel? Did the Minister hear the T&aacute;naiste say that when Deputies Perry and Kenny raised this issue with her, she immediately sought the advice of the Attorney General? Why did he not do likewise?</P>
      <P>Does he recall when the infirmity of the pharmacy regulations came up a year earlier that he personally directed that the Attorney General advise him and he immediately terminated the old regulations? Why break the pattern here? Why did he not go to the Attorney General in this case?</P>
      <P>Why did he show disinterest in the comprehensive file? Why is it mentioned that it was in his outer office after the date in question? Did his advisers not consider this matter or bring it to his attention? Why is the file missing? Does the Minister know anything about that? Where is the file?</P>
      <P>When the Minister says that he knows nothing about this, does he not accept that he is taking the people for fools? He proposes to tell them that the Department knew about this for years, since the 2001 legislation and the legal advice from the South Eastern Health Board, yet the Minister did not know anything about it. Does he believe it is credible to ask people to believe that? Does he think we are all fools? Does he intend to resign? If he does not intend to resign, does he <Col N="984"/>acknowledge that he is a dead man walking as far as a Cabinet member is concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a range of issues. I have made it clear to the House the fundamental fact that I became aware there was an illegal charging regime for long-stay charges when the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice came in late last year. That is the bottom line as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>When the T&aacute;naiste was Minister for Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I went through all the reviews and Mr. Travers goes through all the reviews. I do not make those accusations about other Ministers. I believe the Travers report that they were not briefed to the extent that there was an illegal charging regime in place.</P>
      <P>I note that before this report was ever published, Deputy Rabbitte made his assertions and accusations. He had the script written, the fanciful script by which he always goes, and he has repeated it here again. He had it written before Travers was ever published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the answer to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the answer now. The senior counsel in the courts wrote a note that was handed to me by an official, I had not been briefed on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Was the Minister briefed on anything?</P>

	<P>Does the Deputy want to know the truth? This is an important point because it shows how I act very quickly when issues of this kind arise.</P><Col N="985"/>
      <P>The senior counsel wrote a note and it was passed to me by an official in the Department of Health and Children. This was the Dame Street case as I recollect, although I am open to correction. He wrote in the note that he had to let me know that it was his view that these regulations were <i>ultra vires</i>. As soon as I got that hand written note, I said to the official concerned that I wanted the Attorney General&rsquo;s view on this immediately. We got an opinion from the Attorney General that was emphatic and absolute in its confirmation of the view of the senior counsel.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if, in setting the commercial catch for wild salmon in 2005, he will accept the clear scientific advice that the catch be limited to 95,000 fish to meet conservation limits; and if he instead intends allowing for a catch of 139,900, as recommended by a majority decision of the National Salmon Commission.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 5 together.</P>
        <P>My Department relies upon the advice of the National Salmon Commission and the national fisheries managers executive &mdash; the regional fisheries boards&rsquo; managers &mdash; in determining the terms of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme which,<i> inter alia,</i> sets out district quotas for the commercial wild salmon catch annually. The salmon commission is advised in its work by its standing scientific committee, which includes scientists from Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Loughs Agency and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>The chairman of the salmon commission has advised that the standing scientific committee, in presenting its recommendations to the commission on the precautionary salmon catch advice for the 2005 fishing season, has recommended that the total number of salmon to be exploited by all fishing methods in 2005 should not exceed 124,571 fish. This advice was given for the first time in 2005 based on the adoption of a 75% probability of reaching the conservation limits. The scientific committee does not make any recommendation, however, as to how many of these fish should be allocated to the commercial fishing sector as opposed to the angling sector. Having considered this scientific advice from a fisheries management perspective, the fisheries managers have recommended that the total catch of wild salmon in 2005 should not exceed 173,854 fish, of which the national commercial total allowable catch for 2005 should not exceed 146,174 fish.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission met on 22 February 2005 to consider the scientific and management advice available with a view to finalising its recommendations on the management of the wild salmon fishery in 2005. In his letter of 1 March 2005 to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, the chairman of the salmon commission advised that the commission was unable to reach a consensus on adoption of either the scientific or management quota proposals. He advised, however, that the salmon commission did endorse, by a majority decision, <Col N="987"/>a compromise proposal that the national commercial catch of salmon for 2005 should not exceed 139,900 fish and that this recommendation was made on the basis that the commission would adopt the scientific committee&rsquo;s advice by the 2007 season at the latest.</P>
        <P>We are carefully considering all the advice offered bearing in mind the necessity to balance the needs of all beneficiaries and users of the salmon resource and, in particular, the overriding requirement to ensure the resource is preserved and protected according to the best scientific data. My colleague the Minister of State will make a decision in this matter shortly. In approaching this decision, the implications for the health of the salmon resource of setting the national and district total allowable catches at levels higher than those recommended by the scientists will be carefully considered. In that context, the Minister of State will continue to be guided by the fundamental principle adopted and adhered to by previous Ministers over the last three years, that is, that the national total allowable catch should be progressively aligned over that period with the scientific advice. The Government remains fully committed to this principle as the only sustainable and defensible way forward for salmon management in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I recognise the divergence of advice from the National Fisheries Managers Executive and the National Salmon Commission in respect of when full alignment on the scientific advice is to be achieved. While it is appreciated that the scientific advice for 2005 is based on a revision of the methodology used in previous years and therefore results in a much lower proposed total allowable catch than would otherwise have been the case, we are still strongly persuaded of the case to move to the national conservation limits sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State expects to publish draft wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations setting a national total allowable commercial catch of salmon for 2005 shortly. Under the requirements of the Fisheries Acts, the draft regulations are available for a 30-day consultation period to allow interested parties an opportunity to submit any objections they may have. Following the receipt and consideration of these, the Minister of State will then make a final decision on the scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have spent more than two hours going back over a great scandal in our political and administrative history in the form of charges for patients in nursing homes. Is it possible that the Minister is presiding over another desperate scandal given that we have become an international pariah throughout Europe? Ireland is the only country that still allows drift netting. Only 14% of our major rivers, such as the Nore, Suir, Boyne and Shannon, have an adequate <Col N="988"/>salmon ecosystem. Given that is the case, it is time the Minister said he was strongly persuaded of the case to move to the national conservation limits sooner rather than later. The Minister may not be in Government after 2007. The results of the by-elections this week might impinge slightly on that. Is it fair to say, therefore, that the Minister, his predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, have failed to address the significant issue of wild salmon stocks and prevent a total disaster?</P>
        <P>In his reply the Minister did not explain adequately why he has not accepted the advice of the standing scientific committee which was based on the precautionary principle in regard to the future of salmon stocks. Would it not be appropriate to embark on that in 2005? Should the Minister not still take the initiative in 2005 to protect salmon stocks for our anglers and major rivers? Will the Minister look again at the possibility of a buy-out of the drift net fishermen in the lifetime of this Administration? We heard on the previous day that parliamentary questions to his Department were taken that the Minister had set his face against such a buy-out. Reference was made to Mr. Joey Murrin. Why has the Minister opposed local buy-outs, such as on Erne river? Is it not time to address this issue in a significant way and estimate the costs that would ensue, given the experience of Scotland, Iceland and many other countries with important salmon fisheries? Ireland is the most important country in this area of the environment. The Minister has a key responsibility to ensure that in ten years&rsquo; time we will not ask what on earth did the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, do and why did he not listen to the scientific advice of the day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The difficulty is that we have three different sets of advice, all of which are contradictory. If the Deputy is advocating that we take just one set of advice and act on it, I note his position. The clear policy decision of the Labour Party is that we take the advice of the standing scientific committee. However the Government must balance all the different interests, move as quickly as possible towards an agreed position and is trying to do so over the next two to three years.</P>
        <P>In regard to the buy-out of drift net fishermen, my colleague, the Minister of State, made it clear on the last Question Time that if he had that amount of money available from taxpayers, he could think of better uses to which to put it in the context of angling, the development of the fisheries industry and tourism. I agree with that position. The figures vary from &euro;80 million to a <Col N="989"/>few hundred million euro. If that amount is available, it could be probably better spent. We are trying to balance the various interests such as the conservation interest and the interests of all the beneficiaries of the salmon resources. The resource is currently being preserved and this will be continued for the next number of years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister say why the Minister of State is not present in the House to answer this question? Who makes the decision? Does the Minister make the decision or is it left entirely to the Minister of State?</P>
        <P>The Minister refers to balancing of interests. How can it be possibly in anyone&rsquo;s interests, fishermen, conservationists or anglers, for us to ignore the scientific advice? The Minister stated he has three pieces of advice. The only advice which is based on reasoning and rational preservation of a species which will be of benefit to the fishing community, those interested in conservation and anglers, is for the Minister to accept the advice of the scientists. How can he possibly believe that anyone&rsquo;s interests are served by ignoring scientific advice? I ask the Minister to explain.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister agree that at present a small number of fishing communities are catching a multiple of their conservation limit but fishermen, drift net fishermen and draft net fishermen in other areas on the east and south-east coast have nothing left? This is not a precautionary principle but rather a crisis. A serious problem exists in rivers such as the Nore, the Liffey, the Corrib and the Shannon. How can the Minister say there is conflicting advice as if one holds the same sway as the other? The only advice which any rational Government can follow is the scientific advice which is based on scientific study of the numbers needed to repopulate those rivers. How can the Minister ignore that advice? In whose interests is such a disregard for the survival of this species?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ryan is asking me to do precisely what he is accusing me of, namely ignoring advice. I have three different sets of advice and the adoption of one means I must ignore the others. The Minister of State is responsible for considering the advices available. He will make decisions based on all the advice at his disposal rather than on one piece of advice. He is out of the country and cannot be present in the House this afternoon.</P>
        <P>We are well aware of the need for conservation and are trying to balance that need. We hope to reach a situation over the next few years whereby a balance will be found between the conservation interests and the needs of all other interests.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the debate which was held this afternoon for two and a half hours. The key point of that debate was reference to legal advice. As the Minister who could preside over the effective extinction of wild Irish salmon, an <Col N="990"/>historic symbol of our nation for thousands of years, is it not incumbent on him to follow the scientific advice and to make that difficult decision? I commend the Minister for taking a number of initiatives since we last met in respect of broadband and other issues.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister definitively stating that the precautionary catch level, what could have been achieved during 2005, will be achieved in 2007? Why is it not happening this year?</P>
        <P>Anglers and others with an interest in the environment have repeatedly asked me about the local schemes such as local set-aside and local buy-out. Is the Minister prepared to support those schemes? The response of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to my colleague, Deputy Ryan, a few weeks ago seemed to suggest that the total cost of buy-outs was based on the north-east of England, which is an incredible choice on which to base the calculations of cost. Clearly, local interests are prepared to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister agree that the long-term interests of fishermen depend on the fish being there to catch? Will he agree that science clearly shows that if we ignore the long-term sustainability issue and catch more than the scientists recommend, there will be no fish to catch? This would be lunacy on the part of the Government. It would be the worst policy for the fishing industry and for everyone else in this country. It is bringing shame on this country because this is the last country allowing this drift net fishing. We are permitting this fishing and managing the system above what the scientists say is sustainable. This is pure lunacy.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his preferred policy options for the development of the alternative energy sector with particular reference to the need to promote wind generated electricity production and the encouragement of bio fuel, in view of the desirability to achieve Kyoto targets; if he has satisfied himself that adequate progress has been made or is likely to be made in <Col N="991"/>this regard in the medium term; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The completion of the most recent round of competitive tendering to support renewable energy technologies, AER VI, is an appropriate opportunity to review the programme. Last May, a renewable energy development group was established to advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy in the electricity market to 2010 and beyond. The group&rsquo;s report, which is due shortly, will form the basis of my future policy decisions on the increased penetration of renewable energy technologies in the electricity market.</P>
        <P>Biofuels are addressed in the EU biofuels directive. An interdepartmental group has been set up, chaired by my Department, to consider policy options for the development of a biofuels sector.</P>
        <P>As part of the ongoing work, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland in December. In March 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has now given state aid clearance for the scheme. The scheme will be publicly advertised over the coming days and interested parties will be invited to apply for excise relief, through a competitive call for proposals process.</P>
        <P>The targets in the directive are indicative and not mandatory and many member states, including Ireland, would not be in a position to meet the 2% target by the end of this year. Ireland is starting from a very low current production base, and the 2% target therefore represents a considerable challenge.</P>
        <P>The Deputy can be assured I am committed to the development and promotion of further renewable energy projects in the electricity market and the development of a biofuels market in Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Will the Minister concede that comments made in January by Mr. Tom Reeves, the regulator, that he was unconvinced of the need for additional support for the wind energy sector, has led to something of a crisis of confidence in the renewable energy sector? I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the EU allowances and the tax break is very important. Will the Minister state what he believes to be the necessary level of support that would be adequate to kick-start this again? Wind energy can offer an independent energy source to divert us from dependence on gas from the North Sea. Spain has a thriving wind energy industry employing 25,000 people. Ireland has the capacity to produce 80,000 MW of electricity from wind <Col N="992"/>with a current peak demand of 4,500 MW. Will the Minister agree there could be a potential for export in this important sector? Is there a possibility of introducing more competition into the market which will reduce costs?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to comment on what Mr. Tom Reeves said about support for alternative energy sources because I do not think that would be fair. I reiterate my belief, which is Government policy, that we need to support the alternative energy sector and adopt more ambitious targets. It was for this reason that we established the renewable energy development group that will report to me shortly.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Deputy that we must examine alternatives to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, specifically gas. We should continue to support alternative sources of energy, including but not only wind. The renewable energy development group report should help to clarify the future direction of policy. We need to view alternative and renewable energies on a longer timescale than heretofore and spread costs over a longer period.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>What consultations have taken place with the ESB on the forthcoming deregulation and expanding the grid? The major difficulty with establishing wind farms is the prohibitive cost of connecting to the grid. How supportive has the ESB been of deregulation, opening the market to competition, and wind farms? Do the location of wind farms constrain the development of the national grid?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function in matters such as the price and costs of electricity as these are regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation. In fairness to Eirgrid and the ESB both companies have supported connections to the grid. The Deputy may be adverting to difficulties in certain areas, principally the west, where the grid is not suitable for wind energy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of a conversation with the chief executive of the ESB, I asked him about this issue in the context of the &euro;3 billion programme the company is undertaking to upgrade transmission lines and so forth. He informed me that the upgrade would overcome some of the technical difficulties regarding the grid.</P>
        <P>ComReg is the body responsible for ensuring the ESB and others do not use their position to hinder alternative sources of energy, prevent connections and so forth. A limit has been imposed on the amount of wind energy permitted in the system. As I indicated, we should extend the planning timescale and take a longer term view as opposed to engaging, as heretofore, in short-term planning.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the recommendations in the report (details supplied) published in January 2005 by Britain&rsquo;s National Radiological Protection Board regarding the positioning of mobile telephone masts near schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8395/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The National Radiological Protection Board in January 2005 published the report, Mobile Phones and Health 2004, to provide further advice to address remaining public concerns in the United Kingdom about mobile telephone technology as well as related technological developments. It also reviews progress on implementing the recommendations in the Stewart report published in 2000.</P>
        <P>The report states in general that the board believes the main conclusions reached in the Stewart report still apply and a precautionary approach, that is, where there are uncertainties about the associated risks of using mobile telephone technologies, should continue to be adopted; in the absence of new scientific evidence the recommendation in the Stewart report on limiting the use of mobile telephones by children remains appropriate as a precautionary measure; and measurements made by the NRPB demonstrate that there is no scientific basis for establishing minimal distances between base stations and areas of public occupancy, as has been suggested in some countries.</P>
        <P>Other than referring to the recommendations of the Stewart report of 2000, the report does not make a specific recommendation on the positioning of mobile telephone masts near schools. The article referred to, which featured in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 12 January 2005, appears to refer to comments made by the chairman of the NRPB, Sir William Stewart, during an interview to mark the launch of the report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister will agree, the Stewart report of 2000 specifically stated in one of its main recommendations that planning should be extra cautious around schools as children are more susceptible to the effects of radiation and will be exposed to more radiation over their lifetime than adults. The most recent report to which the Minister referred stated that this recommendation holds, a point emphasised by the chairman of the board of the National Radiological Protection Board in Britain when questioned about it, as noted in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.</P>
        <P>The issue on which I am again attempting to get clarity from the Minister, having tried to do so several months ago, is whether it is advisable, given the limited research available and the views of some leading experts, to have mobile telephone masts located close to schools. Does he <Col N="994"/>agree that this question is of considerable concern to parents of schoolchildren? In 2000 the report of the independent expert group in Britain, the Stewart report, recommended taking a precautionary approach and locating mobile telephone masts at a distance from schools. The Minister, in a reply to a parliamentary question in December last year, suggested that more recent studies removed any validity the recommendation of the Stewart report may have had. However, the latest report by the National Radiological Protection Board restates the position taken in the Stewart report and advises a precautionary approach.</P>
        <P>Who is advising the Minister? Which leading experts are dictating his approach? Why will he not get to grips with a basic question as to whether, in light of the views of some of the leading experts, mobile telephone masts should be located near schools? Prohibiting masts from the vicinity of schools would not cost the State money or impose significant difficulties as it is a simple planning matter. What is the Minister&rsquo;s problem with the view of leading experts that masts should not be located near schools? Will he clarify his position because the response his advisers drew up to my question in November last year has been shown to be grossly inaccurate and without foundation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Planning issues are a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities. In my previous position as Minister in that Department I introduced planning guidelines which, if I recall correctly, take the location of schools into account in siting mobile telephone masts. While I do not have a major problem, decisions in this regard are not my responsibility but a matter for local authorities. I understand some local authorities have adopted a policy of refusing permission to erect any mobile telephone masts.</P>
        <P>The original Stewart report advocated taking a precautionary approach on the location of telephone masts in the vicinity of schools. I have never had a problem with this approach. I do not decide on planning matters in this area. It is a matter for the local authority or relevant Department. I receive advice from officials involved with various international bodies, including the World Health Organisation, and base it on their scientific data and reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyGregory"><NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Minister&rsquo;s policy on this issue? In July 1996 guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae were issued. They stated that free-standing masts should only be located in a residential area or beside schools as a last resort. However, many masts are located across the roads from schools throughout Dublin city and other cities, particularly in the Dublin Central constituency. These <Col N="995"/>guidelines are simply advisory. There is a lack of policy.</P>
        <P>While I accept planning is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has direct responsibility for all issues arising from telecommunications and mobile telephony masts. The Minister rubbished the findings of the Stewart report in a reply to Question No. 97 on 8 December 2004. In it he stated there was no validity in the recommendations that masts be located away from schools. Will the Minister correct the record and accept the validity of the case I have made, backed up by the latest expert report available?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the benefit of having the response to that parliamentary question with me. If I recall correctly, Deputy Gregory insinuated that the Stewart report stated that no mast should be put anywhere near a school. My reply would have been based on that. If my recollection is wrong, I will correct the record. The siting of telecommunications masts is a matter for the planning authorities, not for me as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>when he intends to end an imposition in Killybegs and other major ports whereby no landings can take place between midnight and 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and restore full landing times which are essential, particularly for the pelagic industry.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8485/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>New EU control requirements for pelagic fisheries were introduced in 2004 to meet concerns of possible illegal fish landings in these fisheries across Europe. Such controls are a key element in fisheries management policy to enable the sustainable management and development of the fisheries concerned.</P>
        <P>The requirements created new and more onerous obligations for member states to ensure all landings of pelagic fish over ten tonnes were weighed in the presence of controllers. In implementing the procedures, my Department has acceded to industry requests to allow landings at a variety of ports. The immediate impact of this decision was that some restrictions had to be placed on permitted landing times. To implement this with the available resources, it was necessary to restrict the landing times in the designated pelagic ports. The new controls were extended to the south and east coasts with the inclusion of the Celtic Sea and Irish Sea herring fisheries from 2005.</P>
        <P>While it is desirable to provide 24-hour cover for major ports where possible, this has to be <Col N="996"/>balanced by the legal obligations which the State carries to ensure adequate control presence at those ports when open. I recognise the need to augment the Department&rsquo;s seafood control resources to permit longer opening times at key ports. My Department is pursuing a case for the necessary additional resources.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>No landings can take place at Killybegs harbour between midnight and 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Will the Minister restore full landing times, essential to the pelagic fishing industry? What meetings have taken place on this issue between the Minister and the Killybegs fishermen?</P>
        <P>Regarding illegal catches, will he agree that many fisherman in the area are innocent of wrongdoing and are being unfairly punished by these draconian measures? When will the investigation process into illegalities be completed? Will he agree the slow rate of the investigation is endangering the viability of the port? Despite the large level of State and private sector investment in the port, ships are now bypassing it and landing at Peterhead in Scotland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the difficulties caused by these arrangements. However, it is a question of the number of ports versus the opening hours. If the original decision on the proper control of fisheries was adhered to by the Department, Killybegs would be open on a 24-hour basis. However, the number of ports available for landings would be reduced. The Department is endeavouring to be as fair as possible. It has acceded to the wishes of fishermen, including those in Killybegs, to have more ports covered. However, the hours must be restricted due to limits on personnel numbers. We are trying to address this by getting the extra resources available to have the ports open for longer periods.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has met frequently Killybegs fishermen over the past six months on a variety of issues, although I do not have an exact figure.</P>
        <P>Deputy Perry will appreciate I do not want to say too much on the investigations. The Garda must do its job as quickly and efficiently as possible. I accept innocent fishermen are caught up as a result of this. Unfortunately, where rogues operate, the law must be applied. Since this investigation began, there have been three more incidents which saw individuals taken to court. I have no information on when the investigation will be completed. I know the Garda is anxious to pursue the investigation vigorously and bring it to a conclusion soon. However, it has been an extensive investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister realise the difficulties being encountered by many fish processing companies in the area because of these night-time restrictions? Many have had to reduce staff numbers from 1,500 people to 150. This is <Col N="997"/>the major port on the west coast with its large capacity underused. Will the Minister intervene in this case? I accept the need for due process in the Garda investigation but it is a separate issue. Killybegs port is practically shut.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on this matter. We are vigorously pursuing the allocation of extra personnel to the port. Most landings were at Killybegs. When it was suggested that we concentrate resources there, for one reason or other, the industry decided it wanted wider coverage. If it was a case that the fishing industry was willing to allow Killybegs, where the majority of fish are landed, to be a designated port, then we would be able to give 24-hour coverage. That is something perhaps the fishermen in Killybegs and the fishing industry generally should take into account. It was to accommodate the industry that landings at four ports other than Killybegs were agreed to. That has stretched resources. We are trying to get the resources to ensure those ports can be adequately covered and that we can give the type of coverage for which they are looking.</P>
        <P>A possible compromise would be if we went back to the situation where landings were only allowed to take place in Killybegs. I think I would then be in a position to say to the Deputy that we would be able to give 24-hour coverage and ensure the job losses and the damage being done to the local economy in Killybegs would not continue. So far, we have not got that agreement.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his views on the proposal from the Drogheda Port Company to build a major new port at Bremore in Fingal county; the timeframe and supports available to this project; the way in which he sees the new national port fitting into the recently launched ports policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8206/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In January of this year, my colleague, the Minister of State, launched the Government&rsquo;s ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, <Col N="998"/>planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</P>
        <P>The Department is initially consulting the commercial ports concerned to determine their view of port capacity and how they intend to deal with the projected capacity requirement. The Department is interested in key projects identified by the commercial ports as essential to deal with anticipated capacity requirements to 2014 and beyond, and whether the ports see these as being funded from their resources or in partnership with the private sector.</P>
        <P>Drogheda Port Company has indicated that its proposal for the development of a new deep water port at Bremore will be a key element of its response to the information request from the Department in regard to port capacity. The timeframe for the proposed development and the preparation of a detailed business plan are matters for Drogheda Port Company in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I cannot say at this stage which projects will meet the national capacity requirement. The new policy framework encourages all port sector stakeholders to address the issue of capacity provision. The policy statement makes it clear that the State will support capacity provision as residual financier, but only if proven essential to progress identified high quality self-sustaining projects. Clearly, not all proposals are likely to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister obviously received the briefing documents and so on in regard to the proposal for Bremore. I understand Fingal County Council, in its development plan, is looking positively at the possibility of this development as well. Does the Minister see Bremore and the new Drogheda Port fulfilling a key part in this essential infrastructure, namely, our ports, given that 99% of our trade is by sea? In terms of our size, we are probably one of the most important trading nations in the world. This development might have a role to play in that context.</P>
        <P>I hope we get a chance at some stage to have a full debate on the ports policy document which was interesting in the context of some of the questions it left unanswered. What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the capacity constraints which may exist? The policy document refers to an increase in capacity of approximately 35% to 40% by 2015. Does the Minister see this increase being met by the seven or eight major ports?</P>
        <P>I refer to the comments on privatisation of ports&rsquo; property. The policy document said the Minister has an open mind in regard to privatisation. Obviously, we have a concern that the important land banks of Dublin Port and of other ports around the country would be open to land speculation and to privatisation &mdash; a type of snatch and grab of very important land in urban areas. In this city, the port has marched steadily towards the Irish Sea.</P><Col N="999"/>
        <P>Does the Minister have any views on the criticisms of the ports policy document, which the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources received, by IBEC? I understand the pension liabilities of port workers is mentioned in the policy document. This is another important factor in the likely configuration of our future ports policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am familiar with the proposal of Drogheda Port Company. I have taken a keen interest in it for a number of years. It was good enough to brief me on that proposals as soon as it was finalised. I do not want to prejudice any process which will take place but, having read it and knowing about the ports policy document, it is the type of project and approach we need to use in the development of our ports to meet the capacity demand up to 2014 about which the Deputy spoke and to which the policy document referred. I will not commit myself any further than that.</P>
        <P>I had the opportunity recently to see what Hong Kong has done over the years. It is the ports capital of the world, particularly for the unitised trade. It evolved from virtually nothing over a period. I know China is on its doorstep and we probably would not be able to be as ambitious. Some 80% to 90% of our goods and services are exported, so obviously a strong ports policy is necessary.</P>
        <P>I have no difficulty with the suggestion the Deputy made in regard to ports policy generally and it might be a good idea for us to debate it either in this House or in committee. On the Deputy&rsquo;s point about privatisation of ports and so on, the type of projects about which we are talking, such as the development of 21 hectares in Dublin Port or the proposal for Ringaskiddy, are major projects. The Exchequer will not be able to fund all of them and the ports will have to look to private sources of financing. I do not know what that might end up being but it will involve public private partnerships and the private sector in a big way. In regard to the criticism by IBEC, the policy has been put forward and we will consider any constructive suggestions and adapt policy as necessary as a result. It is a comprehensive document.</P>
        <P>The question of pension liabilities is a matter for the ports themselves. I am aware there are pension deficits in a number of them. Obviously, that must be considered and the interests of the workers must be protected.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>All of us in this House who have been treading the streets of Kildare and Meath in the past few days have seen the consequences of the remarkably fast development that has taken place in those areas without proper planning. Would the Minister agree that Dublin City Council&rsquo;s proposal for a different use of the <Col N="1000"/>south port docks area presents a unique opportunity to use that valuable land, which is within walking distance of the city centre, not merely to store containers but as one of the best quality areas of development so that people do not have to make those incredible congested journeys into Meath and Kildare every morning? If we turn to the Dublin Port Company for direction, it is clear it would plaster the whole of Dublin Bay in concrete and turn the city into a port and nothing else.</P>
        <P>In that context, does the Minister agree that this alternative development of Dublin Port needs strategic leadership from someone like him? Does he agree that this is a clever option, that we can develop our port traffic somewhere like Drogheda which has the proper infrastructure, and put people in the south docks in one of the highest quality locations in the whole of Europe? Will the Minister bring in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Transport, or will he leave it to the port companies to decide what they want? The ports document shows a massive increase in the volume of trade in Dublin Port which gives me no confidence that the Minister is listening to what people in Dublin City Council are setting out as a very intelligent solution.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>his plans for the development of the public and private broadcasting sectors in the future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8380/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy, 2003-2005. These objectives are to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE, to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting, and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form on a universal and free-to-air basis.</P><Col N="1001"/>
        <P>My key priorities for achieving these objectives include the following: developing the regulatory framework by bringing forward a Bill to provide for the establishment of a single content regulator for both public and private broadcasters and to establish RTE on the lines of a company under the Companies Acts, taking steps to establish TG4 as an independent entity, ensuring adequate public funding for RTE and TG4 so that they can deliver on their statutory mandate; building on progress made in maximising the effectiveness of television licence fee collection, developing proposals to ensure that in a digital era Irish viewers continue to enjoy access to a range of high quality programming, and bringing forward proposals for the future licensing of radio services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am of the opinion that viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4 together with private broadcasters. Digital television offers opportunities for Irish viewers to avail of an increased number of broadcasting services, including new services of particular relevance or interest to Irish audiences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>Many local radio stations are being sold for extraordinary amounts of money. Given the proliferation of licences granted in Dublin, is there a possibility of allowing competition in a franchised area where only one licence operates? Does the Minister believe the independent broadcasting fund should be expanded to allow private broadcasters to invest more in public service programming?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of granting licences and the issue of franchises and so on are a matter for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. I have no ideological hang-up about introducing competition. I note that the BCI is allowing increased competition in a number of areas. A few years ago it introduced the concept of a regional radio station in the south east. I have no problem with that.</P>
        <P>The scheme for funding is administered by the BCI and is being finalised. The possibility of using it specifically for what would be termed public service broadcasting is addressed reasonably well given that programmes that are financed from that fund are ones that are not normally and probably never would be funded at peak time rates and they must be played at peak viewing times. The public service element of that is included in the draft regulations that are being put in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it possible that as the BCI makes statements about granting more licences and the more competition there allegedly is, the blander the programme content will become? As we flick through the dials on the way home to Meath or Kildare, will we hear virtually the same types of programmes?</P><Col N="1002"/>
        <P>Is the Minister concerned that the chairman of the BCI has stated that he may reduce the requirement that news and current affairs must constitute 20% of programming? Should there not be a public service broadcasting requirement on every station?</P>
        <P>Are BCI and ComReg not all over the place regarding the spectrum, given that this is such a valuable resource for an island nation? Is it possible that we could utilise it better to benefit the Exchequer as well as everything else? Does the Minister agree that the two regulators are approaching this from different angles?</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to digital services. I note that Oftel, the UK regulator, has published many studies on the introduction of digital services. I have one entitled Driving Digital Switchover. We have had nothing in this regard in this country. The Minister appears not to have asked these regulators for anything in this area. Is that something the Minister might act upon during the next few months in this ministry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is always a danger that if there are more licences, stations will become blander. While the BCI is committed to granting more licences, it is also trying to uphold quality. Some of the licences it has issued have been for specific areas and specific interests. Listenership figures show that we have not yet got to a stage where everything is very bland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the figures for &ldquo;The Dunphy Show&rdquo;?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is trying to tempt me. The reduction of news and current affairs to below 20% of programming is something I would very much regret and on which I would make my views known. There are certain minimum levels of public service broadcasting that most stations should carry.</P>
        <P>On digital services, the Deputy will be pleased that in the next three or four weeks I will be putting in place a few experiments relating to digital terrestrial television. We are talking in terms of setting a date for the changeover from analogue to digital and are starting to move in that direction. The Deputy is correct in stating that we need to give people plenty of notice to ensure both the consumers and the market know our direction in this matter. I will outline our plans in the coming weeks.</P>

	<P>The last point is the one in which I am interested. Has the Minister received a report on the matter? Will he issue a policy document or will he issue direction to the broadcasting commission to establish experimental digital services? Given that the Minister is considering this issue, when does he believe we will have widespread availability of digital services? Does the Minister agree this technology has had a long <Col N="1003"/>gestation period? I have been reading reports for many years stating that technology is just around the corner. While we have turned several corners, we have yet to see a sign of it. I ask for more detail of what is around the corner.</P>

	<P>The Deputies would not expect me to spoil a full-scale announcement due to take place at a later stage. I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan in the matter. About three or four years ago huge interest was expressed in moving to a digital service. As has happened throughout Europe, it was felt the private sector would move into this area. While a competition took place, no successful bidder emerged. We will address the need to move to DTT. Following discussions with ComReg, all the outstanding points are nearly resolved and no major difficulty remains. We intend to provide DTT in a few experimental areas. Based on what we learn over a two to three-year period we will make the decision to roll out the service nationwide. When we launch the experiment I intend to give an indicative date as to when this will move completely to a digital service. I plan to give people as much notice as possible on the conversion.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>if he is concerned at the initial level of pricing for a 3G mobile phone service in Ireland; if his Department has contacted the Commission for Communications Regulation with a direction on this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8203/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function in setting pricing for phone services. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services, is the responsibility of the Com<Col N="1004"/>mission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecommunications policy and my main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland by providing competitive services. It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecommunications services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</P>
        <P>In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition. That direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile phone markets, and to implement where necessary remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players. In doing so ComReg should have particular regard to the following: the market share of new entrants; ensuring that the applicable margin attributable to a product at the wholesale level is sufficient to promote and sustain competition; price level to the end user; and the potential of alternative technology delivery platforms to support competition. ComReg has, as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile phone markets will drive down prices for consumers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the report by ComReg, Market Analysis &mdash; Wholesale Access and Call Origination on Public Mobile Telephony Networks, and the initial 3G prices we have seen not again show that the mobile phone market, particularly for Vodafone and O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> is a licence to print money? Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources found the report shocking. The two main operators have 94% of the market in Ireland. We are the only country where the two leading operators seem to have a co-ordinated strategy. This contrasts with the UK where the top two operators have only 50% of the market. Even in countries like Austria and Finland the third and subsequent operators have at least 25% of the market.</P>
        <P>For two or three years representatives from Vodafone and O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> appeared before the committee and told us a pack of blarney on the matter. They claimed our mobile phone costs were very high <Col N="1005"/>because we love to talk, which we do. However, even on that score, based on the ComReg analysis, while Ireland does not have the highest amount of talk time, we have by far the highest average revenue per user. These two giants, particularly Vodafone, have taken advantage of us right, left and centre. Our revenue per minute is among the highest in Europe.</P>
        <P>The most damning point in the report regarding the Vodafone companies is that while German media commentators and parliamentarians feel the margins there represent a licence to print money, margins here are far higher and the same is true for comparison with O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> in other markets. Does the Minister not agree we have been ripped off by these large powerful companies? While I admit they did well in rolling out the networks and supplying us with mobile phones, in reality we have had to pay through the nose for it. Is it not time we ensured that the decision of ComReg and of the committee was implemented? We need to get mobile virtual network operators on-line as soon as possible. In countries like Britain, Denmark and Finland, where this has happened real competition has emerged. Is it not time for the Minister to issue some policy directives on the matter?</P>
        <P>Changing mobile providers is very difficult. For example, Vodafone has approximately nine different tariff options, including Vodafone Social Life, Vodafone Work &amp; Leisure, Vodafone More to Say, Vodafone Light, Vodafone Extra, Vodafone Active, Vodafone Business 75 etc. I could outline the same number of options for O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?>. Given that virtually all of us have mobile phones, is it not time the Minister took an initiative to stop these companies taking advantage of us in this way to ensure we get real competition. This may necessitate the Minister introducing legislation to give ComReg much stronger powers given the market dominance of the big two. From this damning report, considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources under the chairmanship of Deputy O&rsquo;Flynn, it is clear they are co-ordinating their policy to effectively rip us off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s contribution, which supports Government policy in this area. The thrust of my response to the legitimate question he raised is that the best way of ensuring 3G and other services are provided at a lower price is to ensure there is competition in the market. That function is very much part of the directions I have given to ComReg, which has been mandated to focus on competition as a key objective with a particular emphasis on competition in the fixed and mobile markets. ComReg has the power to introduce remedies where it finds there are barriers to entry into the market or where competition is being suppressed.</P><Col N="1006"/>
        <P>Like the Deputy, I welcome ComReg&rsquo;s recent report. The remedies proposed by the commission in regard to the dominant position of the two mobile telephone companies and the alleged collusion between them will allow mobile virtual network operators access to the networks and ensure access to the market for as many operators as possible. As Deputy Broughan observed, this approach has been successful in other countries. In Denmark, for example, charges dropped by some 25%.</P>
        <P>Although I have no function in this regard, I have had direct discussions with the two leading operators and have made the point to them that the Irish market is overpriced. They, in turn, have made their case to me and supplied me with further details from their point of view. However, I strongly support the view and actions of ComReg in this matter. Competition is necessary and Irish consumers, who are significant users of mobile telephony, contribute greatly to the profits of these companies and deserve better than what they are currently receiving.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPerry"><NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
	<P>ComReg has been very effective and is clearly increasingly empowered in performing its functions. What help can the Minister give the commission to ensure there will be competition in view of two players controlling 94% of the market? What timescale does the Minister envisage for measures such as sharing of masts and deregulation of facilities to allow competition and reduce prices? Is any legislation required to speed up this process?</P>

However, I have noted its recent findings in the report, Market Analysis &mdash; Wholesale Access and Call Origination on Public Mobile Telephony Networks, in which it designated the mobile telephone companies, O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> and Vodafone, as having significant market power and concluded the market was not effectively competitive because of their joint dominance. I note also that the European Commission supported this finding, which was notified in accordance with Regulation 20 of the framework regulations, SI 307 of 2003, and Article 7 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on a common regulatory framework for electronic networks and services.</P>
        <P>A new regulatory framework was introduced in 2003 which was designed to ensure competition between providers, some of which dominate for historical infrastructural reasons thereby giving them market advantage. As Minister with responsibility for telecommunications policy, I welcome any developments that improve competition in the sector. The more competitive telecommunications services that are on offer the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</P>
        <P>ComReg has, as one of its key objectives under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers. Under the new European framework, ComReg&rsquo;s basis for intervening in a market is now predicated on finding an operator dominant in a given market. I also welcome the interest shown by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in this regard and compliment it on its comprehensive review of the mobile telephone market and its associated report.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Government come out of hiding and explain what is going on at the National Aquatic Centre? The centre closed its doors on New Year&rsquo;s Day following roof damage by high winds, has not opened since and seems unlikely to do so for at least another three to five months. I understand the engineering firm originally appointed on behalf of the OPW, Kavanagh Mansfield, to inquire into the damage to the centre has now also been appointed to act on behalf of Campus and Stadium Ireland Development, CSID.</P>
        <P>Has this firm reported and will the Minister publish the report? When I last raised this matter in the D&aacute;il at the end of January, I was told the preliminary report was expected at the end of that week. We have heard nothing six weeks later. Are engineers still refusing to allow any public access on safety grounds, has liability been established for insurance purposes and will the public have to pick up the tab for repairing this &euro;70 million facility? Engineering consultants are working on the site for the various parties with a view to identifying the cause of the damage, to ascertain whether there was a design or construction flaw and, most important, who will pick up the tab for repairing the damage, now estimated to cost at least &euro;2 million.</P>
        <P>The National Aquatic Centre was one of the first examples of a design, build and operate procedure, with a contract awarded to a consortium consisting of a construction company, Rohcon, an architectural firm, S &amp; P Architects and the operating company, Dublin Waterworld. There now seems to be a blame game with Dublin Waterworld referring inquiries from the centre&rsquo;s users, swimmers and gym centre members, to CSID, the Government company which manages Abbotstown and which provided Government finance of &euro;70 million to build the water sports complex. There seems to be a serious conflict over responsibility for the roof damage and who should pay for the repairs.</P><Col N="1009"/>
        <P>In the meantime, one of the country&rsquo;s most outstanding sports facilities remains closed. There are many distressed people, from the 60 employees who appear to face a lay-off of at least six months to gym centre members who are paying gym fees for facilities they cannot use. There is growing concern in swimming and water sports circles and among the thousands of gym club members at the continued closure of the centre and all its facilities. Some 60 staff have been laid off for more than two months and face the prospect of many more months on the dole, yet they have not been told anything by Dublin Waterworld about when the centre may reopen with its roof repaired. Thousands of gym club members have paid expensive gym fees to use the pool and the gym centre but have been left completely in the dark as to when they may enjoy the facilities for which they have paid.</P>
        <P>Water sports interests, including swimming, platform diving, scuba diving and water polo, are also finding it impossible to get reliable information as to what is happening at the National Aquatic Centre. We already know that major swimming events planned for May have had to be cancelled, including the Celtic Masters. It seems that no one at Government level &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism who are the shareholders in Campus Stadium Ireland on behalf of the taxpayer &mdash; is prepared to take responsibility for or an interest in what is going on or, at a minimum, to advise the interested parties what is a realistic timescale for the repair and reopening of this facility which cost the taxpayer &euro;70 million to build two years ago this month and which was opened by the Taoiseach recently. This is a marvellous facility which has suffered a terrible accident. The Government must come clean on when it expects the competition pool, the gym and the leisure pool to reopen to the public and the staff to be re-employed.</P>
        <P>Having regard to the unusual nature of the contract arrangement through a consortium, its seems that no one, the Government included, is willing to take responsibility. That is disappointing. Where is the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism? He has written to me that he is concerned about the impact of the closure of the facility on divers, swimmers and so on, but he does not seem to be exerting himself to ensure the necessary work is carried out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge Deputy Burton&rsquo;s interest in this subject. She and I have raised this matter a number of times but our pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears. On New Year&rsquo;s Day, storm force winds ripped a 25 metre section of the roof from the competition pool of the National Aquatic Centre. The metal roofing was blown across the complex, causing extensive damage inside and outside the building. Management at the centre expected that repairs would be <Col N="1010"/>carried out immediately to facilitate its 7,000 or more members and to retain the services of its 60 staff. However, as it became apparent that no builder was being appointed to carry out the work, management had to make 50 of its 60 staff at that time temporarily redundant. I understand from Deputy Burton that the other ten members of staff have also been made temporarily redundant.</P>
        <P>Despite a commitment given on a &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme by a representative of Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited on 15 February that the centre or part of it would be reopened in two weeks&rsquo; time, no work has yet been carried out. More than two weeks ago at the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism reported that leisure facilities at the National Aquatic Centre would be available in two weeks&rsquo; time and estimated that it would take three months to repair the more extensive damage to the swimming pool. Those two weeks have passed and no work has begun at the centre. Although it is more than ten weeks since the storm damage occurred, to date, no contractor has been assigned. It appears highly unlikely that the estimated three-month timeframe for repairs is anything other than extremely optimistic and that the work will not be delivered on in that timeframe.</P>
        <P>Apart from the unavailability of the facility to its 7,000 members, in the meantime events such as the Irish Water Polo Association national league have had to be suspended. The International Celtic Masters swim meet due to the held at the centre at the end of May will also have to be cancelled as well as number of other events that appear on the centre&rsquo;s website. Even if the pool could be ready in three months&rsquo; time, it would not be ready in time for a large number of these events.</P>
        <P>As I suspected, the management has lost key personnel who could not be expected to wait this long for the centre to reopen. I understand they have got jobs elsewhere. Dublin Waterworld is losing &euro;500,000 or more a month while the centre remains closed. The closure of the centre is not its fault and it cannot be the target of the blame. The Minister&rsquo;s silence in this regard is unacceptable. We have no timeframe for the carrying out of the repairs, no estimate for the cost of doing so and no idea as to the outcome of consultations between the Office of Public Works and Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited. These consultations were promised at an Oireachtas committee but we have had no indication of the outcome of the discussions that took place.</P>
        <P>The taxpayers who paid for the construction of this centre and the many stakeholders in the facility deserve to know why it still lies idle with no sign of repairs beginning. The Minister should, as he has an obligation to do under the leasing arrangement entered into by the Government <Col N="1011"/>with Dublin Waterworld, intervene to ensure that a specific date for the commencement of repairs is identified without delay. If this is the experience in this instance, it brings into question the capacity of the Government to successfully develop large projects such as the National Aquatic Centre.</P>
        <P>I wish to put the following questions, to some of which the Minster of State may not be able to reply. What are the health and safety issues in this instance? Why can the gym and leisure pool not be opened immediately, as was promised some weeks ago by representatives of CSID? Why were we told a month ago that the facility would be reopened in two weeks&rsquo; time? Will the Minister of State indicate when the centre might be reopened? Who is liable for the damage caused? That is an important point. Will the Minister of State indicate when is it likely that a builder will be appointed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I make this reply on behalf of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue. He very much appreciates the opportunity to have his record and that of the Department put on the record of the House. There is no question of silence here. A full reply will be given and it will address most of the questions posed by Deputies Burton and Deenihan. From the information at my disposal, they will appreciate that I may not be in a position to answer all the questions but I will be able to answer the majority of them.</P>
        <?oasys _dc20-?><P>It is important to put this discussion in context and to note our point of departure. The damage to this building was an act of God, not an act of Government. As the Members will be aware, during severe weather conditions experienced in the west Dublin area on New Year&rsquo;s Day of this year, damage was caused to the National Aquatic Centre. The roof of the 50-metre pool and the diving pool and the roof of the leisure water area were separately damaged. In addition, damage occurred to lights and fittings around the complex. This resulted in the National Aquatic Centre being closed to the public while the building was being made safe, the damage being assessed and the repairs undertaken. We were fortunate that nobody was hurt on that date as the centre was closed because it was a public holiday.</P><?oasys _dc0-?><P>Deputy Burton and other Deputies will be aware that on the same day severe damage was caused to a number of installations in the north and west Dublin areas. Deputies will recall that two aeroplanes were blown together on a runway at Dublin Airport and that the roofs and walls of a number of houses in estates in Clonee and Castaheaney in Fingal were stripped by the high winds.</P>
        <P>A number of agents are involved in the National Aquatic Centre. Campus Stadium <Col N="1012"/>Ireland Development Limited is the landlord. Therefore, the State&rsquo;s interest in this is as the landlord. Rohcon Limited and S&amp;P Architects were responsible for the design and construction of the National Aquatic Centre. The centre is leased to Dublin Waterworld Limited. It is the operating company that formed part of the development consortium. Campus Stadium Ireland Development directed the company to close its fitness facility because of a possible risk to members of the public using it. The company has been responsible for all matters relating to the running of the facility since it concluded the lease agreement with Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited. The Minister and the Department are not involved in the day-to-day operation of the centre. The Minister has been kept fully briefed of developments at Abbotstown. He wants the centre to be reopened as quickly as possible while ensuring there is no risk to the public.</P>
        <P>Rohcon Limited responded to the damage on 2 January by doing some initial repair work to make the building safe. Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited managed and oversaw the response to the situation over the following days. The company&rsquo;s priority was to ensure the safety of the public and those using and working in the facility. It focused on ensuring the damage was accurately assessed by the insurance assessors, repairs were carried out as quickly as possible and the debris in the vicinity of the facility was safely removed. Weather conditions, such as the high winds experienced in January, meant that access to the roof proved difficult. That delayed the work of the engineers who examined and reported on it. The national aquatic centre remained closed to the public while the assessment was ongoing, in the interests of public safety. It will remain closed until the essential repairs have been completed.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works has engaged engineers to examine the damage and to provide a report as a matter of priority, at the request of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited, to ensure the health and safety of the users of the facility and to avoid a recurrence of the damage, in so far as it is practical and possible. The consulting and structural engineering company, Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners, has been appointed by the OPW, on behalf of the Department. The report on the storm damage to the aquatic centre that was prepared by the company is independent of and in addition to a report prepared by another engineering company, O&rsquo;Connor Sutton Cronin, which was appointed to examine the damage on behalf of the insurance company that provides the centre&rsquo;s insurance cover.</P>
        <P>Deputy Deenihan specifically raised the question of insurance. The insurers have indicated to Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited&rsquo;s <Col N="1013"/>insurance brokers that they will cover the cost of the storm damage. The House will appreciate that this is an important consideration because the Minister is anxious that the cost of the misadventure should not be borne by the Exchequer. After it presented its report, Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners were appointed by Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited to oversee the development and implementation of the appropriate remedial works for the storm damage.</P>
        <P>Rohcon Limited, which has been given a copy of the report prepared by Kavanagh Mansfield &amp; Partners, has been asked to supply its proposals for remedial works as a matter of urgency. The schedule of remedial works is being finalised by Rohcon, the insurers and Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited to ensure that the centre is restored to the highest standards. Under the agreement between the parties, the damage repair work will begin as soon as possible and will be completed in the shortest possible timeframe. All the parties are anxious to proceed with the work as quickly as possible. They expect to begin the work in the next few weeks and to finish without unreasonable delay.</P>
        <P>The reopening of the centre is not simply a matter of selecting a future date. A firm estimate cannot be given until the schedule of remedial works has been agreed by Rohcon, the insurers and Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited. I am sure Deputies will appreciate that the Minister&rsquo;s hands are tied in respect of matters of this nature. An announcement  will be made about an exact reopening date as soon as it is possible to say with confidence that it is safe to allow the public to enter the premises of the National Aquatic Centre. Contrary to inaccurate information that has been put in the public domain, Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited has been corresponding regularly with Dublin Waterworld Limited about the remedial works and the reopening of the centre.</P>
        <P>The Minister realises that the continued closure of the National Aquatic Centre affects the holding of swimming and diving events, which is regrettable. It is a priority of the Minister to ensure that the centre is repaired and brought into safe use as quickly as possible. While the Minister does not wish to see anybody out of employment, neither he nor Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited has control over the matter, as staff are appointed directly by Dublin Waterworld.</P>
        <P>As the centre has been closed for health and safety reasons, it would not be appropriate for it to reopen until the works necessary to ensure the health and safety of the staff and public have been completed. The Minister and Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited wish to stress that they want the National Aquatic Centre to be reopened at the earliest possible date. Campus Stadium Ireland Development Limited is working with the various parties to achieve this <Col N="1014"/>objective as quickly as possibly. Safety issues must be a priority in that context.</P>

	<P>Carrick-on-Suir is a lovely and progressive town with a population of approximately 5,000. Carrick-on-Suir Town Council has been involved in upgrading certain facilities in the town in recent years. It has improved the town&rsquo;s quality of life by pursuing a host of developments, such as the installation of quality public lighting, the provision of additional car parking facilities, the improvement of roads and footpaths and the development of a new children&rsquo;s play area. The town has an excellent location on the banks of the River Suir, which is a major asset to the town, and on the northern side of the Comeragh Mountains. It benefits from good transport facilities, such as the N24 national primary route and the railway line from Limerick to Waterford and Rosslare. It is near the ports of Waterford and Rosslare. As I have said, it is a fine and progressive town.</P>
        <P>The level of unemployment in Carrick-on-Suir is totally and completely unacceptable. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, issued a press release on Wednesday, 2 March last following the announcement of the results of the national housing survey for the fourth quarter of 2004. He rightly suggested that the figures were positive and suggested they indicate that the Government&rsquo;s policies are working extremely well. He said the Government will continue to pursue the thrust of its successful approach, particularly by maintaining its emphasis on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. While such sentiments are fine, they do not seem to have an impact in Carrick-on-Suir. It is not good enough that unemployment blackspots like that town are being swept under the carpet.</P>
        <P>According to the most recent statistics, 910 of the approximately 5,000 people living in Carrick-on-Suir &mdash; just short of 20% &mdash; are on the live register. It is absolutely unacceptable that the rate of unemployment in the town is four or five times larger than the national rate. I agree with those in the town who feel that it has been abandoned by the Government and the Minister, Deputy Martin. Investment is taking place throughout the country and many places are benefiting from development and job creation. We need to ensure that towns like Carrick-on-Suir receive their fair share of that investment, however, rather than being forgotten. Many enterprises in the town, such as Irish Leathers and Schiesser, have closed down over the years.</P>
        <P>Carrick-on-Suir, which is involved in the RAPID programme, was identified in a report some years ago as being in need of employment. There are high rates of unemployment and poverty in the town. In that context, it is shocking that the Government did not include Carrick-on-Suir in its decentralisation programme. The <Col N="1015"/>people of the town feel abandoned by the Government, which has done nothing to bring additional employment there. They are calling for the establishment of a jobs task force for Carrick-on-Suir to ensure that it gets its fair share of new employment. The sooner that is done, the better. The town has had a high level of unemployment for a number of years &mdash; it is not a problem that has developed overnight, but it needs to be addressed. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, can confirm that the Government, particularly the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is prepared to do something positive for the town by establishing a task force to assist the creation of jobs there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, to which I respond on behalf of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin. According to the latest quarterly household survey, which was published by the Central Statistics Office on 2 March last, the unemployment rate in the south-east region is 5.6%. While that is above the national average of 4.3%, it is a significant decrease on the figure in the previous survey, which indicated an unemployment rate of 6.2% in the south-east region. The live register figures indicate that the number of people on the live register in south Tipperary, including Carrick-on-Suir, is decreasing. The live register figures are prepared on a monthly basis. The figure for south Tipperary in February 2005 was 3,465, down from 3,532 in January 2005. The figure for February 2004, for the purposes of year-on-year comparison, was 3,889. There were 971 people on the live register in Carrick-on-Suir in February 2004. That figure is now down to 910. This is the group on whose behalf Deputy Healy made a plea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusHealy"><NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 20% of the population is on the dole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but that represents progress given the figure of 971 which obtained the preceding year.</P>
        <P>Carrick-on-Suir is the second largest town in Tipperary South Riding. It is ideally placed to benefit from its proximity to both the gateway location of Waterford city and the nearby county town of Clonmel where IDA Ireland is concentrating its marketing campaign to attract overseas companies to the region. An example of this is the announcement in May 2004 by Guidant Corporation of a 1,000-person job expansion at its Clonmel plant, with jobs expected to come on stream from 2005 to 2010.</P>
        <P>lDA Ireland also has a five-acre site in Carrick-on-Suir and this is in the process of being sold to South Tipperary County Council. It is anticipated that the council, perhaps in partnership with local interests, will develop the site to help generate economic activity in the town.</P><Col N="1016"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategy for achieving a better regional distribution of overseas mobile investment away from the larger urban centres, such as Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, is to ensure that companies have credible alternatives which meet their demands in developing first-class business locations. These include infrastructure with easy access to international airports, larger population centres with a strong base of third level graduates, and the availability of high quality business and technology parks with attractive offices and industrial buildings. This strategy is also supported by South Tipperary County Council, which believes economic activity in the county needs to be prioritised in Clonmel, where it will be possible to develop and achieve a first-class business location and cluster development in the life sciences industry.</P>
        <P>On south Tipperary, the strategy for attracting inward investment includes focusing on the growth sectors of international services, health care and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the information and communications sector is likely to have potential for the county in the medium and longer term. IDA Ireland is also working with existing clients in the area to encourage further expansion and new activities. In addition to Guidant, these include Pall Corporation, ALZA and Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland also continues to promote job creation in south Tipperary. Its job creation activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs setting up new high-potential start-up companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at national and regional levels through support for research in companies and third level institutions.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland works with companies to assist them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation so they can compete in world markets. The agency is encouraging companies to adopt new technologies to add value to their products and processes. In the past three years, Enterprise Ireland has made payments of over &euro;4.5 million to client companies in south Tipperary to assist them with development projects.</P>
        <P>The local county enterprise board and the county development board have a very important role to play in addressing industrial development in Carrick-on-Suir. I understand that last October the south Tipperary county manager set up a working group to deal with unemployment issues in Carrick-on-Suir. The purpose of this group is to prepare a development plan for the area.</P>
        <P>The Minister is of the view that further initiatives regarding job creation should be taken under the auspices of the county development board, with which the industrial development agencies are already involved. This would be in line with the position adopted in other areas of the coun<Col N="1017"/>try. In recent years, we have steered away from establishing task forces and, in keeping with this policy, it is not proposed to establish the specific task force referred to by the Deputy on this occasion.</P>

	<P>Last Friday evening, the parents of five families were informed that their children, who were disabled and some of whom were suffering from autism, would no longer be allowed to attend the primary school at Marymount, Ballsgrove, Drogheda. They were given no notice and told their children could not attend on Monday morning. They are very concerned and deeply upset by this decision of the board of management.</P>
        <P>Yesterday morning, in the freezing cold, the parents and children were in protest outside the school. They are very worried about what has happened and feel they have been treated appallingly and abysmally. I rang the school and asked to speak to the principal, who was unavailable. My call was never returned. I rang the Minister&rsquo;s office and explained the problem fully but that call was not returned either. It is a disgrace that the Minister&rsquo;s office did not see fit to update me on a meeting that took place in the school yesterday afternoon between the local education inspector, the school principal and the health board.</P>
        <P>The parents and their children have been excluded from consultation and were excluded from the aforementioned meeting. I understand there may be a meeting tomorrow morning at which they will be informed about what took place at the other meeting. Given the Government&rsquo;s so-called commitment to disability and the money it has committed to disabled persons&rsquo; services, it is a shame that the people in question have been treated in such a disgraceful manner. It is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by parents today that the unit just may be opened again after Easter. How are they to care for their special needs children in the meantime? There is no way the Department and the school authorities should be let away with this. The reality is that if a proper Minister for Education and Science were running a proper system, this would never happen. If there were a difficulty, it would be discussed fully and transparently. Communications would be much better than they are at present.</P>
        <P>I do not know what is in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply and I can only guess it is waffle from the office of the Minister. I regret that is the case. The parents have told me they will continue to protest publicly and in the strongest possible manner until their children are treated like decent, proper human beings. What has occurred is creating much stress for everybody concerned.</P>

	<P>The Department of Education and Science became aware of the proposed closure of this class on 4 March 2005 in a telephone call from the chairperson of the board of management of the school. The chairperson indicated that the class would be closed for a week and that this was necessitated by health and safety concerns.</P>
        <P>The board arranged a meeting for 9 March to discuss this matter and a representative from the Department was invited to attend, as Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd indicated. A report on the outcome of the meeting is still awaited by the Department. The Department understands that the chairperson of the board of management will be in touch with the parents of the children in the special class shortly to convey the outcome of the meeting.</P>
        <P>On the school&rsquo;s accommodation, I understand the school has made an application for a permanent extension, which is currently in architectural planning. The Department recently issued a letter to the school authority approving the rental of three prefabricated classrooms for September 2005.</P>

	<P>I understand that An Post applied for a price increase to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in May 2004. Under the European Communities (Postal Services) Regulations 2002, <Col N="1022"/>ComReg is the designated independent body responsible for pricing policy in the postal sector with regard to the universal service segment of the postal market. I have no function in any consideration of this matter nor in the timing of any decision by ComReg.</P>
        <P>With regard to An Post delivering a world class quality of postal service, I refer to the last report published by ComReg on An Post&rsquo;s quality of service for the first nine months of 2004. The results for the third quarter were 78% for next day delivery, which shows an improvement on the results for the first six months at 70%. Improvement is notable in Dublin where the percentage of local mail delivered the next day was 82% compared with 80% for mail posted outside Dublin for local delivery.</P>
        <P>I have made it clear to An Post that having secured substantial price increases in the recent past, the company should focus its efforts on providing quality services to customers, which is part of its universal service obligations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 28 and 33 together.</P>
        <P>Since its inception, the Government, through the operation of an interdepartmental committee, has stayed in touch with the operation of MediaLab Europe, which was an independent company answerable to an independent board of directors. While it is acknowledged that research will generally require State support, the uniqueness of the MLE model, as presented initially to Government, was that it would be self funding by <Col N="1023"/>2005. However, the financial situation deteriorated significantly in recent times due to MLE being unable to raise the necessary sponsorship and corporate income required and as envisaged in its business plan.</P>
        <P>As it became clear that MediaLab Europe was not developing into a sustainable business model, my Department sought to engage with it in this regard. There were extensive and protracted discussions as I sought to find an appropriate and economically sustainable model for the continuance of MediaLab. Proposals I made in this regard were not accepted by MIT. The board of MediaLab took a decision, in light of its inability to raise financing, to close on a voluntary basis.</P>
        <P>Financing provided to MediaLab Europe by the Government was in line with contractual commitments entered into by the Government. While current expenditure allocations to MediaLab are not recoverable, the Government retains full ownership of the MediaLab building.</P>
        <P>I recently commenced a consultation with regard to the development of a new digital research entity in the previous MediaLab Europe building, located in the Digital Hub. It is proposed that the new entity would consider some research similar to that undertaken at MLE but that there would be greater focus on sustainable research and a more directive research in a new business model. I am also seeking better links to Irish universities, effective management and improved corporate governance, in accordance with general guidelines for State bodies.</P>
        <P>The consultation focused on a number of topics, including research type; research area; preferred management approach; partnership requirement; preferred tender process; level of institutional interest in the project; fit with existing academic priorities and plans; funding issues; definition of intellectual property model; preferred approach to governance. The consultation process is now nearing completion and the Government will make decisions regarding the shape of a new research entity and how an organisation or consortium to manage the facility will be selected.</P>
        <P>The separate Digital Hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, continues to be successful in attracting digital industry tenants and operating community, educational and promotional initiatives. The Digital Hub Development Agency Act 2003 placed the Digital Hub Development Agency on a statutory footing. The agency has been successful in growing the cluster with over 40 companies now employing over 300 employees in the hub.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 21, 49, 62 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>The alternative energy requirement programme, AER, was introduced in the mid-1990s to support the construction of new renewable energy based electricity generating stations. The most recent round of competitive tendering, AER VI, is an appropriate opportunity to review the programme and explore new targets and alternative support mechanisms. To gauge market views on the most appropriate future policy initiatives, my Department conducted a public consultation process on future development of renewable energy which attracted 47 responses last year. This process was succeeded by the establishment of a renewable energy development group in May last year.</P>
        <P>The group is chaired by my Department and comprises relevant experts from the administrative, industry and scientific sector, including the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, ESB national grid and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, among others. The group is at the end of its current work phase and its report is expected to be ready shortly. I cannot make predictions on the role of wind energy or any other renewable energy technology until the group&rsquo;s report is to hand.</P>
        <P>The work of the group has been informed by the renewable energy consultation process and the submissions made in response to our consultation document. Other inputs to the group came from direct presentations to the group from <Col N="1025"/>industry representatives and their associations; analysis conducted by subgroups of the group itself; the work of the CHP strategy group and the bioenergy strategy group.</P>
        <P>It is important to optimise the contribution of renewable energy technologies, including wind energy, to electricity production on a basis that is fair to all parties, including consumers, and to ensure that it can be integrated safely and easily into the national network. The renewable energy development group will advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy in the electricity market to 2010 and beyond.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s report, which is due shortly, will form the basis of my future policy decisions on the increased penetration of renewable energy technologies in the electricity market and will seek to ensure that developers can make a reasonable rate of return on renewable energy projects while ensuring that the interests of national competitiveness and the ultimate burden of cost to the final consumer are all fully taken into consideration.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>the extent to which he has evaluated or compared the wind energy potential here with Scandinavian countries; if he intends to issue directives in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[8364/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not evaluated or compared the wind energy potential here with Scandinavian countries. The question of issuing directives on this matter does not arise.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to one significant difference, namely, that we are dealing with an island system whereas the Scandinavian countries are heavily interconnected. In 1997, a study was conducted on the total renewable energy resource available in Ireland under various assumptions. The net finding was that in the wind energy category there is an abundant resource. However, the challenge in harnessing wind energy in the short term for electricity production is to do so in a manner which integrates the technology into the national network without compromising continuity of supply to domestic and commercial consumers.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to this initial resource audit, the Commission for Energy Regulation commissioned a consortium, led by Garrad Hassan Wind Energy Consultants, to carry out a study entitled, &ldquo;The Impacts of Increased Levels of Wind Penetration on the Electricity Systems of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland&rdquo;. This study was completed in February 2003. The report found that the amounts of wind generation which could be accepted at selected 110 kV transmission system grid supply points without substantial reinforcements and, importantly, without curtailment of wind production but with substantive changes to current system planning criteria <Col N="1026"/>were: 790 MW by the year 2005; 1040 MW by the year 2007; 1140 MW by the year 2010.</P>
        <P>The need to examine these constraints arises from the random nature of the wind resource which cannot be increased or decreased as an energy source for electricity production in immediate response to changes in consumer demand. The current target for wind powered projects does not raise serious technical issues for system stability. However, planning for future programmes at increased penetration levels of wind powered electricity generating plant does raise significant technical issues which must be addressed in order to maintain system security for electricity consumers.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation, which is independent in the discharge of its functions, is examining issues of continuing relevance regarding the grid code for wind powered generators. I have no function in national grid matters, which is primarily a matter for the network operators which in turn are regulated by the Commission for Energy Regulation. From my point of view, it is important to optimise the contribution of wind energy based electricity to the national supply on a basis that is fair to all parties, including consumers, and that it can be integrated safely and easily into the national network. I am confident that the current work of my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland and representative associations of the wind energy sector will ensure future challenging targets can be delivered.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>A migration to digital broadcasting is under way in most EU countries. Different technologies apply to the broadcasting of television and radio services and new technologies are emerging all the time.</P>
        <P>With regard to television broadcasting, Ireland&rsquo;s primary television stations are available throughout the country on a free to air basis through analogue terrestrial transmission. Free to air digital terrestrial television is not yet available in Ireland, although it is provided for under the Broadcasting Act 2001. Over time, the analogue terrestrial network must be upgraded to a digital network.</P>
        <P>In the United Kingdom, customers switching from analogue to digital terrestrial television need to purchase a set-top box. These boxes cost approximately &euro;60 for a basic model, with more expensive models available. The cost of the set-<Col N="1027"/>top box is the primary cost affecting viewers migrating from analogue to digital terrestrial television services and similar costs are likely to apply in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Digital cable/MMDS and digital satellite multi-channel services are currently available in Ireland, on a subscription and pay per view basis. Chorus, ntl and Sky are the principal operators offering digital television services and all charge various viewers on an ongoing basis, generally based on a monthly subscription. Customers choosing subscription based digital television services in a migration to digital television will need to meet the charges placed by the providers.</P>
        <P>I am currently reviewing options for the development of digital terrestrial television in Ireland. In this regard, I have asked my Department to develop a digital terrestrial television demonstration project this year. As the digital terrestrial television demonstration is developed I will outline my intentions regarding possible dates for a switch over from analogue to digital terrestrial television broadcasts. Digital radio transmissions are provided in some countries through the digital audio broadcasting format, DAB. I will examine possibilities for the development of DAB services and trials in the coming year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the schemes to be introduced under the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003. The purpose of that Act was to establish a special fund to encourage both private and public broadcasters to include additional programming of a particular character in their programme schedules. The Act provided that the 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee should be paid into the fund from 2003 onwards. At the end of 2004 almost &euro;17.5 million had been paid into the fund.</P>
        <P>The legislation, which was enacted in December 2003, provided that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, would have responsibility for drawing up schemes through which the fund could be accessed. During the course of 2004 the BCI developed and published a draft scheme and consulted widely about it. In December, the BCI submitted a scheme to me for my approval as required under section 2(1) of the Act. The scheme will also have to be notified to the EU Commission as a new state aid. My Department is in contact with the EU Commission in this regard. Once a scheme has been approved, it is a matter for the BCI to invite <Col N="1028"/>applications and to make awards. I have no role in that process.</P>
        <P>I view the special broadcasting fund as a positive initiative and look forward to listening to and watching some of the new programmes that will be broadcast on Irish radio and television services later this year as a result.</P>

	<P>A total of 19 metropolitan area networks have been completed under the first phase of my Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme and a further seven are under construction. These fibre optic trunk networks have been built in association with the local and regional authorities and are being managed for the State, allowing private sector telecommunications companies open access.</P>
        <P>The second phase of the programme, which is now under way, will deliver high speed broadband infrastructure to more than 92 towns with a population of 1,500 and over that have not yet been provided with a satisfactory broadband service by the private sector. For smaller towns and rural communities, my Department offers the county and group broadband scheme, under which funding assistance is available to enable the provision of broadband for the community using the most suitable technology for that area.</P>
        <P>In addition to these initiatives, my Department, in association with the Department of Education and Science and the industry, is delivering broadband connectivity to all primary and post-primary schools in the country by the end of 2005. Full details of these programmes are on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</P>

        <Quest>when and how he intends to transpose the European renewables directive into Irish law.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The renewables directive addresses an obligation to member states to establish national programmes to increase the gross consumption of renewable energy based electricity by 2010. The target addressed to Ireland in the directive is 13.2% of gross electricity consumption. The directive <Col N="1029"/>imposes other related obligations to support the attainment of the overall target.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the full liberalisation of the green electricity market five years ahead of full liberalisation of the electricity market. The legislative tools were therefore in place, as part of the 1999 Act, to promote a dedicated green electricity market in Ireland prior to the publication of the renewables directive in 2001.</P>
        <P>Article 9 of the directive required member states to notify the form and method of transposition of the directive to the EU Commission. The Department has made the necessary report to the EU Commission. No adverse finding has been made by the Commission on the means of transposition. In addition to the report to the Commission, Articles 3 and 6 of the directive require member states to publish reports on future targets and the various administrative actions taken to deliver on the obligations arising from the directive. These reports have been published by my Department and can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>From my point of view, the priority is to optimise the contribution of wind energy based electricity to national supply on a basis that is practical, affordable and consistent with maintaining systems security. The primary concerns should, therefore, concentrate on the practical administrative arrangements in place to administer and regulate the sector rather than concentrate unduly on the underlying legal basis. I am confident that the current work of my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Sustainable Energy Ireland and representative associations of the wind energy sector within the renewable energy development group will ensure the full requirements of the directive can be delivered on time.</P>

        <Quest>when he expects to appoint consultants to review the electricity sector in this country; the terms of reference of the review; when he expects that the review will be completed; if the Government has any plans to privatise all or any part of the ESB; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I expect that consultants will be appointed to undertake the review of the electricity sector in Ireland in May 2005. In regard to the specific terms of reference, I refer the Deputy to the tender document published on the Government&rsquo;s public procurement website at <i>http://www.etenders.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>As I confirmed in reply to a question on this issue on 8 February 2005, the review will comprise a comprehensive examination of the Irish electricity sector. This will include a detailed examination of the ESB&rsquo;s structure and its domi<Col N="1030"/>nance. It is estimated that the review and report will take approximately six months.</P>
        <P>On the question of the plans, if any, that the Government has regarding the ESB, I have previously confirmed my opposition to the privatisation of the transmission and distribution systems, which are critical national assets that should remain in public ownership. I believe there is strong consensus within Government and elsewhere about this. I have also previously stated my opposition to any privatisation that would result in the creation of a monopoly or near monopoly in the power generation sector.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding this, I will ask the consultants to examine all options as to the future shape of the ESB and, in particular, how to deal with its dominance in power generation. Finding an effective solution to this issue is critical for ensuring the future, orderly development of the market. The consultants will, therefore, be required to identify a range of alternative structures for the ESB and to identify those they consider to be the most appropriate. If the recommendations lead towards a change in the structure of the ESB, I would expect them to be supported by a detailed business case for any proposals.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 25, 32, 42, 53, 60 and 63 together.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels, and I am committed to the development and promotion of a biofuels market in Ireland&rsquo;s transport fuel sector. An interdepartmental group has been set up, chaired by my Department and comprising officials from Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Departments of Transport, Agriculture and Food, and Finance. The group is considering policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.</P>
        <P>As part of the work of this group, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by SEI in December, which examines the full range of options and potential supports for liquid biofuels development in Ireland, including bioethanol and biodiesel. The report is being considered as part of the overall policy objective to increase market penetration of biofuels in Ireland, which is currently at a very low level.</P>
        <P>In March 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a scheme of excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise on biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor fuel. It is envisaged that the scheme will encompass market development for pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has now given state aid clearance for the scheme and the Minister for Finance has introduced the necessary commencement order. The scheme will be publicly advertised over the coming days and interested parties will be invited to apply for excise relief, through a competitive &ldquo;call for proposals&rdquo; process. Under the scheme, excise relief may be granted for pilot projects producing up to 6 million litres of pure plant oil, 1 million litres of biodiesel and 1 million litres of bioethanol.</P>
        <P>Sustainable Energy Ireland is also funding a number of biomass projects and studies through its renewable energy research development and demonstration programme. Under the programme, Sustainable Energy Ireland offers capital grant aid for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of &euro;250,000 has already been awarded by SEI to one company which is demonstrating the feasibility of producing and selling vegetable oil locally as a transport fuel. It is intended that further grant aid will be available under the programme for biofuel demonstration projects.</P><Col N="1033"/>
        <P>It is anticipated that these initial measures will lead to market penetration of biofuels of 0.13% within two years. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are currently being considered but no targets have been set as yet, nor is this a requirement of the EU biofuels directive. The biofuels directive sets indicative targets for market penetration of 2% by end 2005 and 5.75% by end 2010. The targets in the directive are indicative and not mandatory and many member states, including Ireland, would not be in a position to meet the 2% target by end 2005. Ireland is starting from a low current production base and the 2% target therefore represents a considerable challenge.</P>
        <P>Under the EU biofuels directive, member states were required to submit a report to the Commission in 2004, giving details of current market penetration of biofuels and projected targets for 2005. The reports by member states are now available on the Commission&rsquo;s website and indicate that market penetration of biofuels is also low in many other EU member states. Only six countries have identified current market penetration levels of 1% or higher, with a further nine countries, including Ireland, identifying current market penetration levels ranging from 0% to 0.3%. Five countries have not identified current market penetration levels and five have not identified targets for end 2005. Only 20 member states have reports posted on the Commission&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The question of producing biofuel from sugar beet at the Irish Sugar plant would ultimately be a commercial matter for Irish Sugar Ltd. In the event that Irish Sugar Ltd. wished to initiate a new proposal for the production of bioethanol, it is likely that while some existing material handling elements and buildings might be useful components of a bioethanol plant, most &mdash; and possibly all &mdash; of the plant and buildings would require to be newly installed or built. It is understood, however, that following the closure of the Carlow plant, Irish Sugar Ltd. intends to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
        <Quest>when he will end the imposition of the present operating hours for Killybegs and other major ports and restore full landing times at ports which are essential, particularly for the pelagic industry.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>New EU control requirements relating to pelagic fisheries were introduced in 2004. These requirements were introduced to meet concerns about possible illegal fish landings in these fisheries across Europe. Such control is a key element in fisheries management policy and enables the sustainable management and development of the fisheries concerned.</P><Col N="1034"/>
        <P>The requirements created new and more onerous obligations for member states to ensure all landings of pelagic fish over ten tonnes were weighed in the presence of controllers. In implementing the new EU procedures, my Department has acceded to industry requests to allow landings at a variety of ports. The immediate impact of that decision was that some restrictions had to be placed on permitted landing times. In order to implement this with the available resources, it was necessary to restrict the landing times in the designated pelagic ports. The new controls were extended to the south and east coast with the inclusion of the Celtic Sea and Irish Sea herring fisheries from 2005 onwards.</P>
        <P>While I accept that it is desirable to provide 24 hour cover for major ports where possible this has to be balanced by the legal obligations which the State carries to ensure adequate control presence at those ports when they are open. In this respect I recognise the need to augment the Department&rsquo;s seafood control resources so as to permit longer opening times at key ports. My Department is currently pursuing a case for the necessary additional resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function in setting pricing for phone services. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P>International roaming has been identified by regulators throughout Europe and the European Commission as a significant issue to be addressed. ComReg is actively working with other members of the European regulators group in this area. This co-ordinated approach is necessary, as any action taken by ComReg on international roaming would primarily benefit mobile phone users visiting Ireland and would not, on its own, benefit Irish mobile users travelling abroad. A European regulators group composed of national regulators, including ComReg, is now examining this area. The national regulators group aims to present preliminary results of its work in this area in May 2005.</P><Col N="1035"/>
        <P>On the issues of cross-Border roaming, I welcome the publication of the joint ComReg and Ofcom report on cross-Border telecoms issues. The report covers cross-Border mobile telephone roaming; cross-Border leased line costs; telephone dialling codes and illegal broadcast radio stations operating in Border areas. I am delighted that ComReg and Ofcom have adopted a common approach to tackle issues of mutual concern to businesses and the general public on both sides of the Border.</P>
        <P>On 19 January 2005, I issued a press release with my Northern counterpart Minister, Mr. Barry Gardiner MP, which welcomed the publication of this report and expressed concern at mobile phone customers being caught by roaming mobile signals along the Border and incurring international charges for what they think are national calls. I support the report&rsquo;s call for clearer information for customers on all-island tariff options and how to minimise roaming costs. I also support the report&rsquo;s call for the mobile operators to enter into joint arrangements on a cross-Border basis to offer customers all-island tariffs.</P>
        <P>While I acknowledge that a number of operators already offer all-island tariff options, it is disappointing that where these are available they are limited to bill paying customers and business contracts. All-island rates should be extended to pay as you go mobile users, who represent around 70% of the mobile customer base. I appreciate that entering into such arrangements would involve business decisions which are a matter for the operators. For my part, I have already taken the opportunity, in meetings with the operators, to raise this issue and will continue to do so.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the market&rsquo;s response to the report and to ComReg and Ofcom continuing to co-operate on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have not undertaken any specific research on the future availability and price of oil to the Irish market, Ireland, as a member of the European Union and through its membership of the International Energy Agency, IEA, has access to relevant research in these areas.</P>
        <P>With regard to the future availability of oil, the question of how long world oil reserves will last is the focus of many and often conflicting research studies, views and opinions. The IEA published <Col N="1036"/>its 2004 edition of its world energy outlook on 26 October 2004. In this outlook, the IEA indicated that demand for oil will continue to expand, at a rate of 1.6% a year, from a current level of 82 million barrels a day, and that resources of conventional crude oil are adequate to meet demand until 2030.</P>
        <P>Over the years, oil markets have been severely tested by geopolitical developments in the oil producing regions of the world. This is particularly true of recent times with geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the conflict in Iraq and tensions in Nigeria and Venezuela. Notwithstanding this, however, there has been no recent disruption to oil supplies and global production continues to keep ahead of demand. The price of oil is set by the international oil market, with supply being influenced by OPEC policies. The current high price reflects a complex interaction of unanticipated strong demand, tight capacities and geopolitical uncertainties.</P>
        <P>The Irish oil market is an open and private sector one. Retail prices take account of factors such as international market price, importation and distribution costs, and euro/dollar fluctuations. Ireland&rsquo;s high dependence on oil imports makes us price takers, sensitive to the volatility of the markets.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Postal (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which was published in 2001 provides for the issue, sale and disposal of shares in An Post in the context of an employee share ownership plan, ESOP, and possible strategic alliance. The Bill also contains ancillary provisions arising out of a possible change of ownership.</P>
        <P>The financial and industrial relations environment in An Post has changed substantially since 2001. Following operational losses of almost &euro;43 million in 2003, the An Post board approved a recovery strategy for the company. The implementation of the recovery strategy is contingent on agreement with the trades unions to radical restructuring. Negotiations have been ongoing with the trades unions for over a year now and critical aspects are being considered by the Labour Court.</P>
        <P>With the industrial relations situation in An Post at a delicate and critical stage, it would seem prudent to defer consideration of the issues provided for in the Bill until a resolution is found to those issues. For this reason, a decision has been <Col N="1037"/>taken, in conjunction with the Chief Whip, to withdraw the Bill from the D&aacute;il Order Paper. The motion was passed in the D&aacute;il on Tuesday last.</P>
        <P>The Government and I remain fully committed to an ESOP in An Post if it can be demonstrated that real transformation has occurred and that the cost savings envisaged in the ESOP have been achieved. If and when this is achieved, the Bill can be restored to the D&aacute;il Order Paper.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 37 together.</P>
        <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to today&rsquo;s Question No. 7. My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2003 to 2005. These objectives are: to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE; to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting; to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form, on a universal and free-to-air basis.</P>
        <P>My key priorities for achieving these objectives include the following: developing the regulatory framework by bringing forward a Bill to provide for the establishment of a single content regulator for both public and private broadcasters and to establish RTE on the lines of a company under the Companies Acts; taking steps to establish TG4 as an independent entity; ensuring adequate public funding for RTE and TG4 so that they can deliver on their statutory mandate; building on progress made in maximising the effectiveness of television licence fee collection; developing proposals to ensure that in a digital era Irish viewers continue to enjoy access to a range of high quality programming; and bringing forward proposals for the future licensing of radio services in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I am of the opinion that Irish viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4, together with private broadcasters. Digital television offers opportunities for Irish viewers to avail of an increased number of broadcasting services, including new services of particular relevance or interest to Irish audiences.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 38, 44, 46, 51, 52, 113, 122 and 124 together.</P>
        <P>The provision of broadband facilities is a matter in the first instance for the private sector telecommunications companies operating in a fully liberalised market. A number of factors determine where and when broadband services are offered in any area, including the potential number of customers, the level of investment required, and so on.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit, in co-operation with the local and regional authorities. The programme is building high-speed open access broadband networks in almost 120 cities and towns that will be used by private sector companies to offer services at competitive prices.</P>
        <P>A significant feature of the programme is the type of technology used in the metropolitan area networks, MANs. The MANs are fibre based, offering speeds and capacity many thousands of times greater than those available over the copper telephone networks. The MANs are being built in association with the local and regional authorities and will remain in State ownership, which is an important consideration for the future. Nineteen MANs have now been completed on time and on budget, and a further seven are under construction. A number of the completed MANs are already carrying commercial traffic.</P>
        <P>For smaller towns and rural communities my Department also administers the county and group broadband scheme, under which grant aid of up to 55% of set-up costs is available. The programme is driven by the broadband needs of the community, and addresses those needs by funding the most appropriate broadband technology for each particular application. We are also rolling broadband out to all schools in the country by the end of 2005. This involves 4,200 schools and 4,200 communities.</P>
        <P>My Department supports multiple technology solutions and choice in carrier and technology. Although more than 86% of Irish broadband customers use digital subscriber lines, not every telephone line is suitable for this technology, and in such cases another technology must be con<Col N="1040"/>sidered, such as wireless, satellite or cable. The programme will therefore promote the roll out of a range of broadband services by a variety of service providers in those areas that would otherwise go unserved by the private sector alone.</P>
        <P>There are 1.4 million fixed-line telephone consumers in Ireland. We estimate that there are now in excess of 130,000 true broadband consumers, which is almost 9% market penetration. This is up from around 1,000 in March 2003. The latest figures from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, indicate that 40% of Irish homes have a personal computer, compared with the EU-15 average of 45%, and 40% of Irish homes have access to the Internet. By the end of March 2005 Eircom expects to have over 80% population coverage for DSL, and the company aims to have 90% of their lines DSL-enabled by March 2006.</P>
        <P>The incontrovertible facts are that we are the lowest cost country in the OECD for international broadband; our regional broadband pricing is now on a par with the best in Europe &mdash; after Government intervention &mdash; and the price of the basic broadband package is at the EU average. Ireland is also the fastest growing broadband economy in the EU.</P>
        <P>There are 45 different broadband offerings across a variety of technologies. In essence, there are broadband technologies to reach any broadband consumer in Ireland right now. I believe that the industry target should be 500,000 real broadband consumers by the end of 2006. That represents more than one third of the telecommunications market. Internet penetration will continue to grow because broadband is not the only means of accessing the Internet.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s broadband target is to be in the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007. That means a market penetration rate of in the region of 14%. That target is within early reach.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>On 15 November last, I met with the executive of the Irish Postmasters&rsquo; Union which represents postmasters and postmistresses who are responsible for the running of the sub-post office network on a contract basis. I outlined to them my commitment, and that of the Government, to the reten<Col N="1041"/>tion of a viable and sustainable post office network meeting the needs of customers with attractive products and services. I listened with interest to their views and proposals in regard to the development of the network.</P>
        <P>Areas discussed included financial issues affecting rural post offices, as well as computerisation and business development for post offices. I was pleased to hear that they are keen to enhance the range of products and services available through the network. For my part, I encouraged the union to work closely with An Post to continue the development process.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network remains with An Post, and while the Government will support the network in any way it can and has demonstrated its commitment in a tangible fashion with a &euro;12.7 million capital injection in 2003, the way forward is for all stakeholders, including the IPU, to continue to work with An Post in enhancing existing services and to build on existing strengths to develop new product offerings.</P>
        <P>An Post is a commercial State body. The contracts between the company and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and other bodies, are commercial contracts and, therefore, are a matter for the management of An Post.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the automation of the network which was completed in 1997, it has only been in very exceptional circumstances &mdash; such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location which transacts significant volumes of welfare business &mdash; that further offices have been automated. Nevertheless, An Post will undertake a pilot project to automate a selected number of non-automated offices to gauge the effect on new business.</P>
        <P>Finally, in regard to the imposition of a public service obligation, in addition to the Government injection of &euro;12.7 million in 2003, the network also benefits from significant contracts with the Department of Social and Family Affairs for social welfare payments, and the National Treasury Management Agency for Government savings products. It is not envisaged at this stage that public funding will be provided to An Post to meet its universal service obligations.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 16.</P>
        <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the schemes to be introduced under the Broadcasting (Funding) Act 2003. The purpose of that Act was to establish a special fund to encourage both private and public broadcasters to include additional programming of a particular character in their programme schedules.</P>
        <P>The Act provided that 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee should be paid into the fund from 2003 onwards. At the end of 2004 almost &euro;17.5 million had been paid into the fund.</P>
        <P>The legislation, which was enacted in December 2003, provided that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, would have responsibility for drawing up schemes through which the fund could be accessed. During the course of 2004 the BCI developed and published a draft scheme and consulted widely in regard to it. In December the BCI submitted a scheme to me for my approval as required under section 2(1) of the Act.</P>
        <P>The scheme will also have to be notified to the EU Commission as a new state aid. My Department is in contact with the EU Commission in this regard. Once a scheme has been approved, it is a matter for the BCI to invite applications and to make awards. I have no role in that process.</P>
        <P>I view the special broadcasting fund as a positive initiative and look forward to listening to and watching some of the new programmes that will be broadcast on Irish radio and television services later this year as a result.</P>

	<P>In December 2003 my Department, in association with SEI, set up a bioenergy strategy group, BSG, to consider the policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion, and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the penetration of biomass energy in Ireland. Membership of the BSG comprised representatives of various Departments as well as State agencies in the agriculture and energy sectors and industry representatives.</P>
        <P>In tandem with this development, the Department launched a consultation process on future development of renewable energy generally in Ireland. Following on this consultation process, and to ensure future development of our renewable resources, including biomass resources, the renewable energy development group was established on 6 May 2004. The group is chaired by my Department and comprises relevant experts from the administrative, industry and scientific sector including the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, ESB national grid and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, amongst others.</P>
        <P>The bioenergy strategy group is currently inputting into the renewable energy development <Col N="1044"/>group, which is at the end of its current work phase. The report of the renewable energy development group is expected shortly and will form the basis of my future policy decisions on the increased penetration of renewable energy technologies, including biomass, in the electricity market and will seek to ensure that developers can make a reasonable rate of return on renewable energy projects while ensuring that the interests of national competitiveness and the ultimate burden of cost to the final consumer are all fully taken into consideration. It is more than likely that I will publish the report but I have no particular plans in regard to reporting on it to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</P>

In addition, the promotion of renewable energy technologies in electricity production, the harnessing of energy from biomass products and the increased use of combined heat and power technology are key priorities of this Government and also of the European Union.</P>
        <P>Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, addresses an obligation of Ireland to deliver a programme capable of increasing the portion of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. This is therefore the minimum target going forward.</P>
        <P>Existing hydro facilities together with the current AER support programme and activity in the liberalised green market are capable of delivering most of the target in the directive. As the amount of wind energy, in particular, connected to or with binding connection offers increases, further penetration will require co-operation and co-ordination between my Department, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, the market regulator, the CER, the electricity networks operators and developers.</P>
        <P>I am happy to report all these key players, and more, have participated in the work of the renewable energy development group, which was estab<Col N="1045"/>lished on 6 May last and which will report shortly. This report will at a minimum propose actions to ensure Ireland reaches its renewable energy target of 13.2% of gross electricity consumption by 2010 as set out in the directive.</P>
        <P>In addition, in December 2003 my Department, in association with SEI, set up a bioenergy strategy group, BSG, to consider the policy options and support mechanisms available to Government to stimulate increased use of biomass for energy conversion, and to make specific recommendations for action to increase the penetration of biomass energy in Ireland. Membership of the BSG comprised representatives of various Departments as well as State agencies in the agriculture and energy sectors and industry representatives.</P>
        <P>In March 2004 my Department, in association with SEI, also established a CHP policy group, to consider the most suitable and appropriate environments in which CHP can usefully be developed in Ireland, so as to maximise energy efficiency. Both the bioenergy strategy group and the CHP policy group are inputting into the renewable energy development group to ensure a comprehensive renewable energy policy is in place.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that we have in place the necessary incremental steps to ensure increased penetration by renewable and alternative energy technologies in the energy markets. My objective is to put in place support regimes which will ensure orderly development and give reasonable return to project developers while also taking account of the interests of electricity consumers and consideration of national competitiveness.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 82 together.</P>
        <P>The investigation into the funding of public service broadcasting in Ireland arose in the context of a formal complaint by TV3, made originally in 1999, alleging infringements of Articles 92-94 of the EC treaty relating to, among other things, the payment of licence fee revenue and direct grants to RTE. This is one of a number of complaints made by commercial television operators across the European Union against the funding arrangements in various member states for public service broadcasters.</P>
        <P>The investigation so far has involved the gathering of information by the Commission with a view to assessing whether there is any substance to the complaint. The letter which was received from the Commission on 3 March sets out its preliminary views and is regarded as a necessary first step in what could be a lengthy investigative process. The letter also sets out a number of recommendations which the Commission considers must be implemented before the funding scheme for RTE can be considered as compatible with the relevant provisions of the EC treaty.</P>
        <P>The recommendations proposed by the Commission are of a detailed legal and regulatory nature which I will carefully consider with the advice of the Attorney General and I will also consult with RTE over the next month, by which stage a reply is required by the Commission. I welcome the fact that the Commission has found that the financial measures granted in favour of RTE and TG4, in the form of licence fees, are considered as existing aid.</P>
        <P>It is worth recalling that the funding arrangements for RTE have been in place since the enactment of the Broadcasting Authority Act in 1960. That Act provided that RTE would be funded from a combination of television licence fee income and commercial income principally generated from the sale of advertising. In the time since Ireland&rsquo;s accession to the EEC in 1973 there have been many developments and clarifications in relation to European state aid and competition laws. As regards public service broadcasting, as recently as October 2001 the EU Commission published its guidelines on how it would interpret and apply the treaty obligations in this sector. In view of this it is not surprising that the Commission has found that some aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s arrangements are incompatible with elements of the EC Treaty.</P>
        <P>This matter is being given the highest priority within my Department. Under Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No. 659/1999 laying down rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty, Ireland will have one month to respond to the Commission&rsquo;s preliminary view. Article 17(2) also allows for an extension of the time where the Commission considers this to be justified.</P>
        <P>Following this process the Commission may then issue a formal letter under Article 18 making <Col N="1048"/>recommendations proposing appropriate measures designed to bring the scheme into line with the treaty. Such a recommendation may propose: a substantive amendment of the aid scheme; the introduction of procedural requirements; or the abolition of the aid scheme.</P>
        <P>Under Article 19 Ireland must accept or reject these recommendations. If Ireland rejects the proposals, the Commission may proceed with a formal investigation procedure under Article 4 of the regulation. This is a more formal procedure which imposes strict deadlines. Non-compliance with a negative decision at the end of this process will be pursued by the Commission in the Court of Justice for the European Communities. At this stage I am confident that Ireland will be able to achieve a satisfactory outcome.</P>

        <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by business interests in Donegal about the future of the Killybegs fishing industry amid fears that up to 1,000 jobs could be lost; the steps he is taking to ensure the future of the fishing industry in the area in view of its importance to the economy in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by business interests in Donegal about the future of the fishing industry there. Indeed, as the Deputy will be aware, the fishing industry in Europe and elsewhere is experiencing difficulties at the present time. I believe that the primary challenge facing the fishing industry at the present time concerns the need for effective conservation measures to provide for the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks into the future.</P>
        <P>The industry in the north west is significantly based on pelagic stocks. In this regard I secured a substantial increase in the quota for blue whiting at the Fisheries Council in December 2004. At my request Bord Iascaigh Mhara will work closely with the industry to develop a significant human consumption market for vessels landing blue whiting into Irish ports in order to maximise the benefits of this fishery.</P>
        <P>I continue to work closely with the industry to address concerns expressed by its representatives arising from the introduction in 2004 of new EU procedures for the weighing of pelagic fish. These EU measures, which strengthen control in pelagic fisheries, were introduced in 2004 as a consequence of concerns about illegal landings right across Europe. Proposals designed to provide for <Col N="1049"/>the weighing of fish after transport from the port of landing while ensuring full control and accountability are currently being evaluated. These proposals have been brought forward as a result of a joint Council and Commission declaration which I secured at last December&rsquo;s Fisheries Council.</P>
        <P>With regard to demersal species, I wish to draw attention to initiatives such as the closure of codling fishing grounds off the Greencastle coast in County Donegal, which was introduced in 2003. A long-term recovery plan for cod was also introduced in 2004, which will help to rebuild this stock. I am confident that these two measures will also contribute to the recovery of other whitefish stocks under pressure in this area.</P>
        <P>County Donegal, and in particular the Killybegs area, has been to the forefront of the Irish fishing industry and notwithstanding recent difficulties, I am confident it will maintain this pre-eminent position in the future and remain an economic linchpin of the area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 61 together.</P>
        <P>Support to increase the penetration of renewable energy technologies generally in the electricity market is administered by my Department with some support from the research and development programme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland. The current minimum target my Department is working to deliver, is to increase the consumption of electricity from renewable energy sources to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010 in accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</P>
        <P>To ensure this target is met, a renewable energy development group was established in May last. It includes representatives from the renewable energy representative associations and the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. In the course of the work of this group a wide spectrum of views and opinions was expressed by the parties involved, including a view expressed by the energy regulator that the wind sector is now sufficiently developed to operate on a merchant <Col N="1050"/>basis. In the interests of clarity and transparency, I put the view of the energy regulator out for public consultation and several replies have been received. The views of the respondents will be considered alongside the view of the energy regulator.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation is an independent body under paragraph 9 in the Schedule to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. I have no power to issue directions to the commission of the type referred to.</P>
        <P>From my point of view, the priority is to optimise the contribution from all renewable energy technologies on a basis that is fair to all parties, including consumers, and that it can be integrated safely and easily into the national network. Future support will deliver what is necessary to achieve stated targets while ensuring the interests of national competitiveness and the ultimate burden of cost to the final consumer are all fully taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>The renewable energy development group is now at the end of its current work phase and its report will be delivered to me shortly. The report will provide me with a useful platform to settle future targets and support mechanisms.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recently published European Commission&rsquo;s plans for 2005 in terms of European energy priorities.</P>
        <P>A key priority identified by the Commission is the achievement of a properly functioning internal market for gas and electricity for the benefit of all citizens. In that connection the Commission has stated its intention to undertake a further in-depth review of progress in creating the internal electricity and gas market. On the basis of that market analysis, the Commission will assess the need for additional measures, having further stated that a more competitive market needs to be developed.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports the approach being adopted by the Commission. We will participate fully in any discussions at EU level on a refocused energy policy both to protect our national interests and to ensure market competitiveness is maximised. As I have already today outlined in my answer to another question on this issue, the request for tenders for the review was issued on the Government&rsquo;s e-tenders website and in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 February 2005. The call for tenders is based on the &ldquo;open procedure&rdquo;, which means that it is open to any interested party within or outside Ireland to submit a tender. The deadline for submission of tenders by interested parties is set at 12 noon on 4 April 2005.</P>
        <P>The selection process will be undertaken by a steering committee established by my Department and is expected to take between four to six weeks to conclude. The process will, in all likelihood, involve short listing and interviews with short listed candidates. The award will be on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender, MEAT, and in accordance with six specific criteria identified in the tender document. Following the notification of unsuccessful bidders, a period of two weeks has to be allowed before a contract can be signed. This means that the contract award should take place around the end of May.</P>
        <P>Turning to the final part of the question, studies by the CER in support of its own decision making are matters for the CER, in which I have no function. I do not expect a report from the commission in the matter.</P>

	<P>My Department maintains a watching scientific brief on health issues relating to non-ionising radiation, including mobile telephony. The Department&rsquo;s involvement in matters concerning the health effects of non-ionising radiation, which includes radio frequency emissions from mobile phone base stations, is guided by advice from national and international health authorities which include the World Health Organisation of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>Mobile telephones are in use internationally. The limits for non-ionising radiation are global limits established internationally by the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP. My Department will continue to liaise with the appropriate international bodies to ensure that the standards operating in Ireland comply with the ICNIRP guidelines.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for monitoring health and safety issues relating to mobile phones is currently vested in my Department but a number of other Government Departments and public agencies have an interest in the matter. The Deputy will be aware that the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently discussed this issue. The committee is considering a draft report in the matter of non-ionising radiation from mobile telephone handsets and masts and the issue of institutional responsibility in this matter can be reviewed further by Government in the future.</P>
        <P>I am informed that, in the UK, the National Radiological Protection Board performs an advisory role on the potential adverse health effects of non-ionising radiation for British Government ministries, in particular the Ministries of Trade and Industry and Health and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in relation to planning matters. The board is due to move into the Health Protection Agency from 1 April when it will become the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards.</P>
        <P>My Department to date has not received any communication from ComReg which would indicate any breach of health or safety standards arising from this survey of mobile telephones.</P>

        <P>As Minister with responsibility for energy matters, including the development of our indigenous renewable energy resources, my remit is to create a positive framework whereby these resources can prosper and contribute significantly to our energy needs. A renewable energy development group was established in May 2004 to review existing policies and examine best inter<Col N="1054"/>national practice. The group will shortly make such recommendations as it deems necessary to deliver, at minimum, the target addressed to Ireland in Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</P>
        <P>The group will also incorporate the work of the bioenergy strategy group and the combined heat and power policy group to ensure that a co-ordinated comprehensive renewable energy policy is proposed.

	<P>The Deputy refers to a recent report, A Preliminary Investigation on Shelf Edge and Deepwater Fixed Net Fisheries to the West and North of Great Britain, Ireland, around Rockall and Hatton Bank. This important report is under consideration by my Department. The occurrence of so-called &ldquo;ghost-fishing&rdquo; as a result of fishing gear being discarded and left on the seabed is a cause for concern and requires remedial attention.</P>
        <P>During its EU Presidency, Ireland made it a priority to press for more environmentally friendly fishing methods and, I am pleased to say, succeeded in achieving the adoption of Council conclusions on this important subject. The conclusions were agreed in June 2004 and included provision for the European Commission to develop a pilot project to address the problem of ghost fishing in Community waters through, <i>inter alia</i>, the implementation of a retrieval system to remove lost gear. I anticipate progress on this issue during 2005.</P>
        <P>In addition, catch limitations for deep-water sharks were introduced at EU level for the first time for 2005 at the December 2004 Agriculture and Fisheries Council. As many deep-water fisheries straddle international waters where non-EU vessels are also fishing, the need for a wider international approach to the problem is an important consideration. It is therefore important to ensure that the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission is fully involved. Hopefully, it can act as <Col N="1055"/>a catalyst for remedial management measures in the wider context.</P>

It has statutory independence in carrying out this function.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall strategic policy and legislation in the sector. In this regard section 13 of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 allows me to issue policy directions to ComReg, in the interest of the proper and effective regulation of the electronic communications markets. However, actual regulatory interventions or decisions relating to operators, such as quality and coverage, are the responsibility of ComReg, the independent regulator. In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions including a direction on competition. These directions can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The Government has consistently ruled out buy out as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks. Since 2002, it has instead promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective. While I have no plans to introduce a single stock management system for the commercial catching of wild Irish salmon, I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of the policy outlined above.</P>
        <P>No convincing case has been advanced as to the advantage to the public good of a publicly funded buy out of commercial salmon licences. I have previously stated that the cost of buying out commercial salmon drift net licences in Ireland could be as high as &euro;75 million based on buy out proposals implemented in recent years in Northern Ireland and the north east of England. The cost of buying out up to 56 licence holders is understood to have cost some £3.25 million sterling. On this basis, I have assessed the cost of a similar voluntary buy out scheme in Ireland, with special consideration of the cost if such a scheme were to be taken up in full by the 887 licensed drift net operators. The cost would increase substantially if all other commercial fishing nets were to be included.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Deputy agrees buy out proposals on such a scale are impractical. We must caution against excessive expectations of significant amounts of compensation. As I have previously indicated to the House, I am prepared to keep the matter under review. I am open to any relevant proposal whereby stakeholders benefiting from a reduction in commercial catch identify themselves and indicate a willingness to fund any compensation that might arise.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 123 together.</P>
        <P>There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of an Post are to adapt to a changing environment and continue to offer a good service to the customer into the future. To <Col N="1057"/>progress the change agenda, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post management and An Post trades unions has taken place over the last year. While negotiations between company management and the Communications Workers Union, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, were ongoing for most of 2004, they have yet to be brought to a successful conclusion despite much useful work.</P>
        <P>To keep up the momentum of the process and in an effort to resolve all remaining difficulties, outstanding issues on collection and delivery arrangements are being dealt with in the Labour Court with a view to agreeing a way forward through the implementation of a recovery strategy aimed at returning the company to a secure financial footing. The challenge is for both sides to redouble their efforts to agree to put in place and manage the changes necessary to allow An Post to thrive in an increasingly competitive market. Their efforts will have the support and assistance of the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery.</P>
        <P>The Government and board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the programme for Government. I have met with the Irish Postmasters Union and listened with interest to its views on the future development of the network. My officials are in regular contact with the management of An Post to assist with securing and developing our post office services. The post office network has been the subject of a number of studies and reviews in recent years. Many of the recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented with particular regard to winning new business, including extra banking and new utility transactions.</P>
        <P>There is widespread recognition that the best strategy to sustain the network is for An Post to continue adapting to customer needs within the financial constraints in which it now finds itself. I have asked the Irish Postmasters Union and An Post to work in partnership to maximise their efforts to secure existing business and pursue new business at every available opportunity.</P>

	<P>As I informed the House in my response to the same question from the Deputy on 22 February last, under the Fisheries Acts 1959 to 2001, the issuing of permit charges for angling is an operational matter for the relevant regional fisheries board. In this instance it is a matter for the Shannon Regional Fisheries <Col N="1058"/>Board. It is not an issue over which I, as Minister of State with responsibility for marine matters, have any control. I am advised that all revenues generated by the regional fisheries boards from permit fees are retained by the boards and re-invested in the ongoing management and development of fisheries in their regions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The areas to which the Deputy refers are closed areas for one species only, orange roughy, which inhabits a deep sea fishery. Deep sea quotas were introduced for the first time in 2002, covering the years 2003 and 2004. Revised quotas for 2005 and 2006 involving cuts of 15% for most species, including orange roughy, were agreed at last December&rsquo;s Council. As the Deputy is aware, there is a particular need to protect orange roughy because of the very long life cycle of the species which makes it particularly vulnerable to exploitation.</P>
        <P>The implementation of effective management strategies is an especially acute challenge in such circumstances and experience in similar fisheries in other parts of the world, notably in New Zealand, suggests that more targeted alternatives to the closure of large sea areas is, at least, equally effective. A major scientific project is currently under way off Ireland&rsquo;s west coast to assess orange roughy spawning aggregations and estimate stock biomass. The project involves scientists from the Irish Marine Institute, BIM, UCC and NUI Galway as well as from New Zealand and Norway. The results of the work will be available in a number of months.</P>
        <P>I will ensure that the results of the study are made available to relevant parties, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, and DG FISH. In the event that the study justifies an alternative management approach to the current orange roughy closures, I will press the EU Commission to bring forward new proposals for a more tailored and targeted management plan for orange roughy.</P>
        <P>In respect of the deep sea stocks subject to TACs, most of which are of high value, the Irish deep water fleet has quotas of almost 3,000 tonnes available to it in 2005. On the basis of these allocations and additional opportunities for other non-quota stocks, the deep sea fishery will remain important for the small number of vessels concerned.</P>

	<P>The licens<Col N="1061"/>ing of independent radio stations in Ireland is a matter for the independent Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, BCI, and one in which I have no direct role. The revenue return to the Exchequer for use of national assets, including radio spectrum, is a matter primarily for the Minister for Finance and I have no function in this regard. I can give policy directions regarding spectrum fees to the Commission for Communications Regulation only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>Under its statutory obligations, the BCI determines, <i>inter alia</i>, the type and number of licences to be issued in any region. While I have no powers to issue a directive to the BCI on competition in the radio sector, I wish to maintain a suitable legislative framework for local radio licensing in Ireland. My Department carried out a review of radio licensing in Ireland last year. The review consisted of an extensive independent report by Ox Consultants and a public consultation process. My Department will produce a final report on the consultation later this year and I will consider proposals for suitable legislative reform with regard to radio licensing.</P>
        <P>While I will consider new legislative proposals to improve the overall licensing framework, I am clear that decisions on the nature of the services to be licensed and licence awardees should remain the remit of an independent body.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 89 on 8 February 2005 which read as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">RTE&rsquo;s statutory mandate, as defined in section 28 (1) of the Broadcasting Act 2001, provides that RTE&rsquo;s radio and television services shall be made available, in so far as is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland. It is a matter for RTE to determine how best to fulfil its statutory mandate and I have no function in the matter.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">RTE is not mandated to make its services available to Irish communities living abroad. RTE has, however, acted in a number of ways that has resulted in its radio or television <Col N="1062"/>services being more widely accessible. In addition to being available throughout Ireland, RTE&rsquo;s long wave radio service is available throughout much of the UK and parts of Europe. RTE services can also be accessed online.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">In the past, certain RTE television programming was available in the UK on a commercial television channel, Tara TV. I understand that the company went into liquidation due to a lack of commercial success. Advances in broadband technology will give RTE additional options for making its services available in the future. This is likely to result in increased opportunities for Irish people living abroad to access RTE&rsquo;s radio and television services.</P>

The directive repealed Directive 96/92/EC.

It is also an offence under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 to harass a person by use of any means including by use of a telephone.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is responsible for policy to protect children from the transmission of pornographic images by phones and other media.

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The recommendations referred to by the Deputy were outlined in a report of the marine casualty investigation board on the tragic <Col N="1064"/>incident which involved the collision between the yacht <i>Debonair</i> and the cargo vessel <i>Bluebird</i> in Dublin Bay on 20 May 2001 with the loss of four lives. The report was published on 3 March 2005. I convey my sympathies to the families of the four victims on their tragic losses. The recommendations are being examined in my Department. If necessary, I will bring forward appropriate measures to address any shortcomings in the statutory bases either of the regimes governing alcohol consumption on vessels or the enforcement arrangements.</P>
        <P>Section 24 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 makes it an offence for the master and other crew members of cargo vessels to be on duty while under the influence of alcohol. The Merchant Shipping (Pleasure Craft) (Lifejackets and Operation) (Safety) Regulations 2004, which came into effect on 2 June 2004, provide for controls on the operation of pleasure craft while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In particular, it states that the master or owner of a pleasure craft shall not or shall not allow another to operate or control or attempt to operate or control the craft while he or she or the other is under the influence of alcohol or drugs or any combination of drugs or of drugs and alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the craft.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department has had no discussions with Dublin City Council regarding the future use of port lands on the southside of the River Liffey, nor has it carried out any analysis of the possible future use of these lands for residential development. The Dublin Port Company is a State-owned company established under the Harbours Act 1996. The Act provides that the principal objects of the company include the provision of such facilities, services and lands in its harbour for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary.</P>
        <P>It is understood that a concept plan &mdash; the Poolbeg framework plan &mdash; has been submitted to Dublin City Council on foot of an invitation for urban design and land use studies. Submitted by consultants DEGW, the framework plan notes that the Poolbeg peninsula, other than the port area on the northside of the Liffey, is the only large tract of land open to unique concepts for a <Col N="1065"/>large scale city-wide amenity close to the city centre.</P>
        <P>The Dublin Port Company has informed Dublin City Council of its concerns about lack of consultation on the concept plan. The company also has pointed out that the concept plan is in contravention of the current city development plan, the draft city development plan up to 2011 and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority master plan for the area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 118 together.</P>
        <P>World gas resources can easily meet projected demand. Proven reserves have outpaced production for the past 25 years and equal about 66 years of current production. While it is clear that the geographic sources of gas for north west Europe will change over coming years, there is no particular threat to Irish supplies. The market is close to being fully liberalised and there will be several suppliers. The Kinsale field continues to provide Ireland with some supply of gas and supplies coming from the Corrib and Seven Heads fields will reduce Ireland&rsquo;s import demands in the coming years.</P>
        <P>There is adequate infrastructure capacity in place to meet import requirements for many years ahead. Under section 19 of the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, the Commission for Energy Regulation is required to prepare and publish an annual forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system over a seven year period. The 2004 capacity statement was published on 12 November and set out a range of possible demand scenarios which may be expected to arise over the coming years.</P>
        <P>The gas capacity statement indicates that our infrastructure is sufficiently robust to cater for the majority of scenarios modelled. Only in the case of the highest demand forecast, in tandem with delays to the coming on stream of indigenous supply sources, would reinforcements to the infrastructure require to be envisaged. The CER is working with Bord G&aacute;is, the transmission system operator, to investigate the requirements for reinforcing the onshore Scotland system, should the need arise.</P><Col N="1066"/>

	<P>My Department is currently involved in drafting new legislation which will amend the Nurses Act 1985. The new legislation will modernise the regulatory framework operated by An Bord Altranais for nurses and midwives. Work on the draft Heads of the Bill is at an advanced stage and all stakeholders will have an opportunity to comment on the draft legislation.</P>
        <P>It is my intention that the new legislation will acknowledge the request from midwives for recognition of their distinct identity and, in accordance with recommendation 4.45 of the Commission on Nursing, will provide for the establishment of a statutory midwives committee.</P><Col N="1067"/>
        <P>The removal of the midwifery qualification as an eligibility requirement for entry to public health nursing is a matter for An Bord Altranais. Regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions, including the setting of requirements and standards in the education programmes leading to registration, is the statutory responsibility of An Bord Altranais. I understand that, in removing this requirement, the board was mindful of recommendation 8.30 of the report of the Commission on Nursing which recommended dropping the mandatory requirement of a midwifery qualification for those wishing to train as public health nurses.</P>
        <P>The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nurses and midwives has been a concern of this Government for some time. There are approximately 900 nursing and midwifery staff in the three Dublin maternity hospitals. According to the most recent Health Service Executive nursing resources survey there were 27 vacancies in these hospitals at the end of December 2004.</P>
        <P>An expert group on midwifery and children&rsquo;s nurse education was established in September 2004 to develop a comprehensive strategy for the future of midwifery and children&rsquo;s nursing. The expert group, which comprised representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the education sector, health service providers and unions, presented its report to me in late December 2004.</P>
        <P>The report is under active consideration at present and a decision on the future of midwifery education will be announced shortly.</P>

        <Quest>the steps he will take to instruct local authorities not to impose rates on child care facilities which are being provided by private operators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>I have no plans to provide for special treatment of cr&egrave;ches under the Valuation Act. The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long standing position that commercial facilities &mdash; including child care facilities such as playschools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools &mdash; are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process could thus substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</P>
        <P>The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on the net annual value, NAV, that is, the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the commissioner of valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent valuation tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</P>
        <P>Rating legislation, as distinct from valuation legislation, and issues arising from it are matters for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
        <P>The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, our policy has been to increase child benefit by substantial amounts as the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependent children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status. We have also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care places by tax incentives to set up facilities, relief from VAT and relief from benefit in kind, BIK, for free or subsidised child care places provided by employers. Taken together these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care.</P>
        <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care. In that context, the establishment of the &euro;499 million Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, with funding provided by the European Union and the Exchequer under the NDP, aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 55%, or about 31,200, by programme end.</P>

As part of this process, a licence to install equipment on the premises referred to has been granted to a mobile telephone operator.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the licence, the operator is required to strictly comply with all relevant health and safety Acts and will operate within current standards and EU regulations and adhere to the guidelines on exposure limits to emissions, issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, ICNIRP.

	<P>As I have already stated, my Department is at present considering an application for consent to install the onshore pipeline. Both the quantified risk assessment, QRA, and the Johnston report, to which I have referred previously, will form part of this process. In so far as there may be issues in the QRA that need further clarification, elaboration or even additional material, Mr. Andrew Johnston, assisted by other independent consultants, will provide the necessary advice to my Department.</P>
        <P>On 21 February 2005, Shell reactivated its application for consent to install and commission phase 3: onshore pipeline and umbilical, originally submitted in June 2002. On 24 February <Col N="1071"/>2005, my Department wrote to Shell requesting the clarification and elaboration of certain information and studies provided in the 2002 application.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department met with Shell on Friday, 4 March 2005, to discuss these issues further. In the course of this meeting Shell advised that the company had appointed Shell Global Solutions to carry out a peer review on the QRA and any associated reports-studies submitted to my Department by the then operator Enterprise Energy Ireland Ltd. Shell has agreed to submit these reports to my Department by early April of this year. It is my intention to appoint a consultant who is an expert in quantified risk assessment to review these documents and report to me on all aspects, especially that of public safety. I intend to publish these reports immediately when available.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to progress consideration of the application for consent to install the upstream pipeline in an open, balanced and informed manner. My decision to publish the full suite of documents mentioned above, prior to my making a decision, will, hopefully, allay local fears in regard to the safety of the pipeline and the process being adopted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The most recent figures from the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, indicate that there are now in excess of 130,000 broadband consumers, which is almost 9% market penetration. This is up from around 1,000 in March 2003.</P>
        <P>The latest figures also show that 40% of Irish homes have a personal computer, compared with the EU-15 average of 45%, and 40% of Irish homes have access to the Internet. By the end of March 2005 Eircom expects to have over 80% population coverage for DSL, and the company aims to have 90% of their lines DSL enabled by March 2006.</P>
        <P>In terms of achieving higher levels at broadband penetration in Ireland, the latest figures shown on the website <i>www.internetworldstats.com</i> show 1.3 million Internet users in Ireland, or 32.8% of the population, an increase of 68% in the years 2000 to 2005. The penetration figure for the 25 EU countries is given as 44.8%. The signs <Col N="1072"/>are encouraging. I believe that the industry target should be 500,000 broadband customers by 2007. That represents more than one third of the telecommunications market.</P>
        <P>The Government target is to be in the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007. That means a market penetration rate in the region of 14%, which is, in my opinion, easily achievable.</P>

	<P>A list of all consultancies relating to the introduction of digital television services is being made available. The total amount spent over the period in question is &euro;2,591,744. These costs relate primarily to technical, financial and legal advice in relation to the &ldquo;multiplex&rdquo; licence competition held by the Department in 2001 and 2002.

        <P>With regard to television broadcasting, Ireland&rsquo;s primary television stations are available throughout the country on a free-to-air basis through analogue terrestrial transmission. Free-to-air digital terrestrial television is not yet available in Ireland, though provided for under the Broadcasting Act 2001. Over time, the analogue terrestrial network must be upgraded to a digital network.</P><Col N="1073"/>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no function in setting pricing for phone services. The <Col N="1074"/>regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</P>
        <P>As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy, and my main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland by providing competitive services. It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</P>
        <P>In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition. The direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile markets, and to implement, where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players and also to have particular regard to the following: market share of new entrants; ensuring that the applicable margin attributable to a product at the wholesale level is sufficient to promote and sustain competition; price level to the end user; and the potential of alternative technology delivery platforms to support competition.</P>
        <P>ComReg has, as one of its key objectives, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its <Col N="1075"/>functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers.</P>
        <P>I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe. However, ComReg&rsquo;s quarterly key data for the Irish communications market for Q3 2004 indicate that the Irish mobile operators&rsquo; average revenue per user is the second highest in Europe; Switzerland has the highest.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that ComReg proposes to introduce new measures in 2005 to stimulate competition in the mobile market following its recent determination that Vodafone and O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> have joint dominance in the wholesale mobile access and call origination market. These measures may include requiring Vodafone and O<?oasys _cf8-?>2<?oasys _cf1-?> to open their networks to mobile virtual network operators and requiring that existing national roaming arrangements be maintained.</P>

In so far as there may be issues in the QRA that need further clarification, elaboration or even additional material, Mr. Andrew Johnston, assisted by other independent consultants, will be providing the necessary advice to my Department.</P>
        <P>On 21 February 2005, Shell reactivated its application for consent to install and commission phase 3: onshore pipeline and umbilical, originally submitted in June 2002. On 24 February 2005, my Department wrote to Shell requesting the clarification and elaboration of certain information and studies provided in the 2002 application.</P>
        <P>Officials from my Department met with Shell on Friday, 4 March 2005, to discuss these issues further. In the course of this meeting Shell advised that the company had appointed Shell Global Solutions to carry out a peer review on the QRA and any associated reports-studies submitted to my Department by the then operator Enterprise Energy Ireland Ltd. Shell has agreed to submit these reports to my Department by early April of this year.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to appoint a consultant, who is an expert in quantified risk assessment, to review these documents and report to me on all aspects and especially that of public safety. I intend to publish these reports immediately when available.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to progress consideration of the application for consent to install the upstream pipeline in an open, balanced and informed manner. My decision to publish the full suite of documents mentioned above, prior to my making a decision, will, hopefully, allay local fears in regard to the safety of the pipeline and the process being adopted.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 105 together.</P>
        <P>I rely upon the advice of the National Salmon Commission, NSC, and the National Fisheries Managers Executive, NFME, regional fisheries boards&rsquo; managers, in determining the terms of the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme, which <i>inter alia </i>sets out district quotas for the commercial salmon catch annually.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission is an independent statutory body established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1999 to assist and advise me, as Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, on the conservation, management, protection and development of the national salmon resource and, in particular, on the national wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations. The commission includes representatives of the commercial fishing sector, the angling sector and other relevant stakeholders.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission is advised in its work by its own standing scientific committee, which includes scientists from BIM, the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Loughs Agency and the Marine Institute.</P>
        <P>On 30 November last, the standing scientific committee presented its preliminary recommendations to the commission on the precautionary salmon catch advice for the 2005 fishing season. At that time the scientific committee&rsquo;s preliminary advice recommended that the total number of salmon to be exploited by all fishing methods in 2005 should not exceed 122,305 fish. I understand, however, that this advice was updated to a figure of 124,571 fish when the final catch statistics report for the 2004 season became available from the Central Fisheries Board towards the end of January last. This advice was, for the first time in 2005, based on the adoption of a 75% probability of reaching the conservation limits. The scientific committee does not make any recommendation, however, as to how many of these fish <Col N="1078"/>should be allocated to the commercial fishing sector as opposed to the angling sector.</P>
        <P>This scientific advice was considered by the NFME from a fisheries management perspective and the fisheries managers then submitted their advice to me on 14 February regarding salmon conservation measures and salmon quotas for 2005 and beyond.</P>
        <P>In its advice, the NFME recommends that the total catch of wild salmon in 2005 should not exceed 173,854 based on achieving a 50% probability of meeting the conservation limits. The NFME advice also includes preliminary recommendations for a suite of conservation measures that it believes should be introduced in the fishery. The NFME believes that if these measures are introduced in 2005, a provision of 27,500 fish should be sufficient for exploitation by anglers this year. With this figure in mind, the NFME recommends that the national commercial TAC for 2005 should not exceed 146,174 fish and that the conservation limits be met on a staged basis in each district by 2008.</P>
        <P>The National Salmon Commission met on 22 February 2005 to consider the scientific and management advice available with a view to finalising its recommendations on the management of the wild salmon fishery in 2005. The chairman, in his letter of 1 March 2005, advises me that the commission was unable to reach a consensus on either the scientific or management quota proposals. He advises, however, that the National Salmon Commission did endorse, by a majority decision, a compromise proposal that the national commercial catch of salmon for 2005 should not exceed 139,900 fish and that this recommendation is made on the basis that the commission would adopt the scientific committee&rsquo;s advice by the 2007 season at the latest.</P>
        <P>I am still considering the advices offered to me, bearing in mind the need to balance the needs of all beneficiaries and users of the salmon resource. I expect, however, to publish draft wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations setting a national total allowable commercial catch of salmon for 2005 very shortly. These draft regulations will also set out the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for each of the 17 fishery districts around the coast.</P>
        <P>Under the requirements of the Fisheries Acts, the draft regulations are available for a 30 day consultation period to allow interested parties an opportunity to submit any objections they may have. Following the receipt and consideration of these, I will then make a final decision on the scheme.</P>

	<P>I am advised that the Department has exchanged correspondence with the north Atlantic salmon fund, NASF, on the management of the Irish wild salmon fishery in recent years. I understand that a meeting took place in February 2003 between my colleague and predecessor as Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the chairman of the NASF. I am advised that this meeting was arranged to discuss the organisation&rsquo;s views about the netting of wild salmon by Irish commercial fishermen. Since being appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the marine in 2004, I have not met nor have I had any discussions with the NASF.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Government&rsquo;s view that our salmon stock is a national asset, which must be conserved and protected, as well as being exploited as a resource, on a shared and sustainable basis. A delicate balancing exercise is therefore necessary between the needs of the coastal and inland communities who depend on fishing resources for their livelihood and the recreational users, including tourists.</P>
        <P>Since 1996, the Department has introduced a range of conservation measures which have seen considerable advancements made in salmon <Col N="1080"/>policy and in particular the management of the commercial salmon fishery. As part of these measures, the drift net season is now confined to a two month period in June and July on a four day week basis. Fishing is only allowed during daylight hours and is confined to the area within the six mile limit. The regional fisheries boards operate the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme, which <i>inter alia</i>, limits the total allowable commercial catch of salmon.</P>
        <P>This policy of promoting the application of quotas on commercial fishing, including drift netting, and bag limits on angling, has delivered significant catch reductions aimed at achieving the overall shared objective of restoration of salmon stocks. As a result, I have no plans to introduce proposals to cease drift netting for wild Irish salmon but I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of the policy outlined above.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>In March 2004, my predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, under section 13 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, issued policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, including one on broadband. This direction required ComReg to use regulatory and enforcement tools, where necessary and subject to relevant requirements under European and national law, to support initiatives to develop broadband and remove regulatory barriers, if any exist, to such initiatives. ComReg was required to have a particular focus on the residential and SME sectors, balanced regional development and potential for broadband provision on alternative platforms. The goal set for ComReg was to be at, or better than, the EU-15 average, excluding accession countries, for end user access to, and usage of, broadband by mid-2005.</P>
        <P>In its latest report on the policy directions, ComReg has reported that there were more than 114,000 DSL customers as of December 2004, an increase of over 50% in the previous three months. There are, in addition, around 16,000 other broadband connections provided through a mixture of wireless and leased line applications.</P>
        <P>While the primary technology deployed here, DSL, which incidentally is that in use generally across Europe, will not be available to 100% of the population, other technologies, such as fixed wireless access and satellite, will extend the coverage. Overall, levels for coverage of broadband now exceed 75% and are in line with the European average as outlined in the March 2004 policy direction.</P>
        <P>The acceleration of local loop unbundling should also stimulate improved broadband offerings. In addition, initiatives by the operators to supply broadband are being supplemented by a range of Government initiatives, including metropolitan area networks, MANs, schools broadband and community broadband. ComReg is working closely with the appropriate parties on all of these initiatives.</P>

	<P>My policy on electricity generated from renewable sources, of which wind is the dominant technology, in the first instance is to increase consumption from these sources to 13.2% of total consumption by <Col N="1083"/>2010 as required by Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.</P>
        <P>To ensure that this target is met, a renewable energy development group was established in May last. The group&rsquo;s report will also assist me in deciding on future targets and support mechanisms for the renewable energy sector, including wind energy. From my point of view, it is important to optimise the contribution of renewable energy technologies generally, including wind energy, to electricity production on a basis that is fair to all parties, including consumers, and that it can be integrated safely and easily into the national network.</P>
        <P>Following the discussions of the group, I received a letter from the energy regulator expressing the view that the wind sector is now sufficiently developed to operate on a merchant basis. In the interests of clarity and transparency, I put the view of the energy regulator out to public consultation and several replies have been received. The views of the respondents will be considered alongside the view of the energy regulator.</P>
        <P>The Commission for Energy Regulation is an independent body under paragraph 9 in the Schedule to the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. I have no power to issue directions to the commission of the type referred to.</P>

An exceptional needs payment can be made towards any exceptional, unforeseen and non-recurring expense which a person is unable to meet from his or her own resources. In the situation cited, the person with responsibility for meeting the funeral costs would apply to his or her local community welfare officer for assistance, if necessary, towards those costs.</P>
        <P>There is no automatic entitlement to an exceptional needs payment and the community welfare service makes a decision on each application on its merits. Neither I nor my Department has any role in determining entitlement in individual cases.</P>
        <P>It is unlikely that a person in the situation cited by the Deputy would have the necessary social insurance contributions to enable a bereavement grant to be payable to his or her next of kin or personal representative.</P>

	<P>The package of changes, the principles of which were announced by my predecessor a year ago, are not designed to implement EU Directive 2004/28 in Ireland. Rather, they are designed to address a number of issues and problems identified with the existing national regime, in particular, by making the prescribing regime more workable and effective and by extending the range of outlets which may supply on foot of a prescription. There has been wide consultation with stakeholders, including farmers and the veterinary profession, during the formulation of this package and the next stage in this process is to formally consult with the animal remedies consultative committee as provided for in the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>Implementation of Directive 2004/28 will involve a number of changes in national legislation and procedures, many of which are designed to improve the availability of veterinary treatments. Preliminary work on this transposition exercise has begun in my Department. This exercise also involves liaison with the Irish Medicines Board and, in due course, consultation with other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, a number of aspects relating to implementation of the directive remain to be fully resolved at EU level, including whether certain categories of medicines will be exempted from the mandatory prescription requirement. The deadline for completion of this latter exercise is 1 January 2007 and, in the interim, existing national distribution routes, which include provision for availability of products &ldquo;off-prescription&rdquo;, will remain in place.</P>

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was refused by my Department at initial stage, on 14 September 2004. The Deputy should note that marriage to an Irish national does not automatically carry any entitlement to the granting of a visa to enter the State. In cases such as this, the visa officer will, among other considerations, look for sufficient evidence of a clear pre-existing link between the applicant and their sponsor.</P>
        <P>There is a general reluctance to approve visas for persons whose sole reference in Ireland has never met them or has met them only once during a brief visit abroad. This would have been taken into account in reaching a decision on this application as no evidence of a prior meeting was supplied. It was also noted that there appeared to be inconsistencies in the application that were not addressed by the applicant.</P>
        <P>An appeal was received in respect of this application on 24 January 2005 but, based on the additional evidence supplied, the visa appeals <Col N="1089"/>officer was unable to conclude that the original decision should be overturned. Consequently, the application was refused on appeal on 16 February 2005.</P>
        <P>As each application is entitled to only one appeal, it is not possible to further re-examine the case. A fresh application must be submitted should the applicant still wish to travel. Any such application should be accompanied by additional supporting documentation that it is felt will address the reasons for refusal outlined above and previously notified to the applicant on 19 November 2004.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138, 172 and 173 together.</P>
        <P>The &euro;499 million Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-06, EOCP, includes a measure which provides grant assistance towards staffing costs for community based not for profit child care services which serve disadvantaged parents through the provision of reduced cost child care to support the parents when they are in employment, education and training. About &euro;180 million of the programme funding has been set aside for this purpose to cover the period to end 2007, with the remainder going to capital development and to quality enhancement.</P>
        <P>Staffing grants are normally made available for three years in the first instance. In assessing grant <Col N="1090"/>applications, ADM Ltd., which undertakes project appraisals on behalf of my Department, looks at information submitted by the group, such as the socioeconomic profile of the area and the group&rsquo;s target client group, the local levels of deprivation, the ethos of the group towards disadvantage including the numbers of places which it intends to set aside for children from disadvantaged families and children with special needs and the proposed fee structure for the service. It also uses externally available material such as the deprivation index to review and confirm these data and also consults with the county child care committee on each application to get reinforced local knowledge.</P>
        <P>Total commitments to date from this staffing grant allocation are approximately &euro;105 million and this is assisting with the cost of delivering child care for about 22,000 children. While it was envisaged that some groups would progress to sustainability after the initial three year grant, it was always expected that some groups in particularly disadvantaged areas would require ongoing support towards the cost of delivering child care for particularly disadvantaged parents. It is in this context that the present review is taking place. In the interim, staffing grant assistance at existing levels is continuing for all projects which are delivering their agreed targets of child care service.</P>
        <P>The review is being carried out by the child care directorate of my Department in conjunction with Area Development Management Ltd., the company which manages the day to day operations of the programme. The review is primarily focused on those projects which will have already received three or more years of staffing funding under the programme at any date prior to 31 August 2005. It is not the intention of this review to reduce, in any way, the overall level of funding directed at projects which support disadvantaged families, but rather to ensure that all this funding is put to the best possible use in terms of assisting those families most in need to end the cycle of disadvantage in which they find themselves.</P>
        <P>From the perspective of the national development plan, of which the EOCP is an element, social exclusion is defined as the cumulative marginalisation from production or employment, from consumption or poverty, from social networks, community, family and neighbours, from decision making and from an adequate quality of life. It is clear that any assessment of the disadvantage experienced by a grant recipient under the EOCP will involve the consideration of different factors depending on the circumstances of the particular group.</P>
        <P>One of the more important quantitative tools which has been used in the context of the review is the index of relative affluence and deprivation, which is regularly used by ADM Ltd. in its appraisal work under the EOCP. The index was first developed in the late 1990s and was recently updated using data from the 2002 national census. <Col N="1091"/>The index is based on three of the underlying dimensions of social disadvantage: demographic decline; labour market deprivation and social class disadvantage. The scores for the index are derived from a number of general population indicators including male and female unemployment rates, percentage of population with primary school education only, percentage of population with third level education and the<?oasys _jy?>percentage of households with children aged 15 years and under which are headed by a single parent.</P>
        <P>Every recommendation which comes to me on the funding of projects is made following consultation between ADM and the grant applicant, ADM and the relevant county child care committee, and by the programme appraisal committee. I expect that each case for continuing staffing funding will be examined through the same process as a result of which informed decisions will be made. I am hopeful that I will be in a position to clarify arrangements to groups in late April or early May, following the meetings of the two monitoring committees which oversee the delivery of the EOCP.</P>

	<P>I have received representations from solicitors representing the sister of one of the victims of the Grangegorman murders of 6 and 7 March 1997 requesting that there be an independent public inquiry into the Garda investigation of the murder. As I have indicated to the House previously, I am not at present satisfied that the investigation which has been performed has fallen short of the standard required by the European Convention on Human Rights or of the potential effectiveness of a full public tribunal of inquiry.</P>
        <P>However, in view of matters which have been raised, and in order to assist me in my consideration of the request, I asked the solicitor involved to outline in further detail the reasons he considers a public inquiry to be necessary. I have received a response and, while it does not put forward further details, I have referred the correspondence to the Attorney General. In addition, I expect to receive a detailed report, which I have requested from the Garda authorities on matters arising in this case.</P>
        <P>I will consider the matter further taking into account any further submissions made to me, advice from the Attorney General and a report from the Garda authorities. As I have also previously indicated to the House, the criminal <Col N="1092"/>investigation into these two murders is not closed and that this would have clear implications for what further action, if any, I may consider.</P>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</P>
        <P>The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of Crumlin and Sundrive Road Garda stations will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of garda&iacute; allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional garda&iacute; will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</P>

        <Quest>the options open to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 1; if there is <Col N="1093"/>a mechanism to re-open this person&rsquo;s appeal to consider the full facts of the case; and if he will agree to do so.</Quest>

	<P>The person concerned arrived in the State on 5 January 2004 and claimed asylum. His application was refused by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. He was notified of my decision to refuse him refugee status by letter of 20 October 2004 and afforded three options: to leave the State before his case was considered for deportation; consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of him; make written representations, within 15 working days, setting out the reasons why he should not be deported, that is, why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</P>
        <P>His case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>. A deportation order was made in respect of him on 26 January 2005. The order was served on him requiring him to present himself to the Garda national immigration bureau on 17 February 2005. He presented as requested and is due to present again to the bureau on Thursday, 10 March 2005, for arrangements to be made with the Nigerian Embassy for the issue of travel documents.</P>
        <P>His legal representatives recently lodged an application for re-admission to the asylum process with the ministerial decisions unit of my Department pursuant to section 17 (7) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. However, after careful consideration of the case, and having regard to the views expressed by the independent monitoring committee about the handling of his appeal by the refugee legal service, my Department concluded that the new material submitted to support his request did not significantly add to the likelihood of him qualifying for asylum and, as such, the request for re-admission to the process was refused.</P>
        <P>The deportation order remains extant and the Garda national immigration bureau will be making arrangements for his return to Nigeria as soon as travel documents are available from the Nigerian Embassy.</P>

	<P>A person who is lawfully resident in the State is under a legal obligation to register with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Thus, even though a person has the permission of the Minister to be in the State, he may be in breach of immigration law if he or she fails to register.</P>
        <P>However, the converse of this situation is that if a person has, through some error or omission, failed to obtain a stamp in his passport, the existence of the registration certificate, although not in itself the actual permission, will be taken as sufficient evidence of residency for naturalisation purposes.</P>
        <P>Inquiries made about the Deputy&rsquo;s question disclosed that the applicants had periods where they had received permission to remain in the State which were not noted in their passport. I have asked my officials to look into this matter having regard to the foregoing and to contact the Deputy and both applicants directly with their findings in this regard.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 to 156, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In replies that I have given to parliamentary questions on PULSE on a number of occasions recently, I have addressed this matter in considerable detail. In that regard, I refer the Deputy to my most recent response to his Priority Question No. 59 on Wednesday, 16 February 2005.</P>
        <P>The specific additional information requested by the Deputy is as follows: PULSE is the primary IT operational system for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It manages incidents from its initial capture through to final disposition of the incident, including recording of court outcomes where appropriate. Due to the scale of the <Col N="1098"/>system, it was implemented in four major releases from April and May 1999 to October and November 2003. Between these major releases, smaller releases addressing application fixes and small scale additional functionality have been undertaken. Development of the system is always subject to review. For example, a pilot project on the electronic transfer of summons applications to the Courts Service and receipt of courts schedules and court outcome data is at the early stage of development.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that PULSE compares favourably to computer systems used by other police forces. The system operates on a 24 hours per day, 365 days per year basis and during 2004 was operational for 99% of that time. One of the features of PULSE is that it is an integrated system with information captured once only and made available to operational members as required, including the provision of a single point for searches and queries. There was extensive user involvement in the design of the system to ensure that there is a consistent &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; across all system areas.</P>
        <P>Under the present coverage of PULSE, at 181 locations nationwide, over 75% of Garda personnel have direct access to the system in their own stations. I might point out that it was never the intention to have the PULSE facility in all 703 stations, many of which are manned for a limited number of hours per day or, in some cases, per week.</P>
        <P>A review of the effectiveness of PULSE will be undertaken in the context of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Information and Communications Strategy 2005-09. One of the issues for review is the approach to further extension of the system to non-networked locations. On the issue of the most appropriate way of inputting data to PULSE, including the amount of Garda time involved in the process, a working group has been set up to consider these matters. Consideration is being given by the group, <i>inter alia</i>, to call centre type operations using civilians. While I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the various streams of work currently underway, my aim is for the PULSE system to operate in the most effective and efficient way possible.</P>
        <P>From time to time the situation does arise when members travel to the nearest networked station to input and update PULSE data. However, I am advised by the Garda authorities that this practice is kept to a minimum and generally affects rural areas where there is a smaller number of PULSE incidents. The longest distance by road between a Garda station which is equipped with PULSE and one that is not so equipped is 39 miles.</P>
        <P>On the question of supervision or checking of the input of data, a supervisory sergeant has the ability to log onto the system and review all incidents created. Finally, I am advised by the Garda Authorities that in the past three years there have been three visits by other jurisdictions, namely <Col N="1099"/>Norway, Iceland and Spain, to view the PULSE system.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 161, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>In the case of Finglas Garda station, which is not of an acceptable standard, I have already stated that immediate priority is being given to providing a new Garda station there. A suitable site has been identified by the Office of Public Works on the Mellowes Road, and I understand that it is in negotiation to agree the terms for the purchase.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the precise date when construction of the new station can commence is in the first instance dependent on the site being acquired by the Office of Public Works. In that regard, I am assured that the purchase is being pursued as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>In the interim, in addition to carrying out certain necessary refurbishment works to the station, the Office of Public Works is endeavouring to negotiate a short-term lease for additional space in Finglas village to alleviate the accommodation problems at the station.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda authorities do not prioritise Garda stations for repairs. I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 109, ref. 5080/05, of 16 February 2005 in which I stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure that it meets the operational requirements of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. As I indicated, where it does not meet those requirements, the required refurbishment or construction works are completed by the Office of Public Works with all due urgency and in accordance with overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources.</P>
        <P>In addition, in excess of &euro;7 million has been allocated in the Garda Vote for 2005 for necessary maintenance works to Garda premises. In that context, I am satisfied that every effort is being made and will continue to be made, to ensure a high standard of Garda premises throughout the country.</P>

	<P>My predecessor, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, set up an expert group to examine the probation and welfare service under the chairmanship of Mr. Brian McCarthy. This group produced its first report in November 1998. The final report was published in May 1999 and made several recommendations.</P>
        <P>Many of the recommendations of the expert group report have been implemented by my Department. Staffing levels have been raised. There has been substantial investment in a customised IT system and an IT unit has been established. The new technology, when fully operational, will have the capacity to produce information about the utilisation and effectiveness of community sanctions and will provide information about crime in Ireland not previously available. A common State funded public liability insurance scheme has been put in place to enable a greater number of community groups to have <Col N="1102"/>community service projects operated on their premises without the need to incur substantial insurance costs. These are some of the measures which have been implemented.</P>
        <P>The service has responsibility for implementing those orders of the court which require the supervision of offenders by the probation and welfare staff, that is, probation and other supervision orders and orders which require work to be performed by way of retribution to society, for example, community service orders. The service also provides to courts pre-sanction assessment reports which enable judges, in determining sentence, to take into account the personal and social circumstances of the offender, the level of risk that further crime will be committed if he or she remains in the community, the attitude of the offender to the victim of the crime and the work programme available to the offender to prevent involvement in further crime.</P>
        <P>The service supervises both serious and less serious offenders, who are placed under supervision orders by the courts. It also supervises persons released by order of the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from prisons and places of detention, including life sentence prisoners who have served substantial periods in custody. It has a youth justice section which has been resourced to implement the provisions of the Children Act 2001 throughout the jurisdiction. It also provides a limited service to the Irish Prison Service, working with the other prison based disciplines towards the rehabilitation of those in prison. In addition, it also prepares detailed assessment reports for the interim parole board.</P>
        <P>In recent years the service has been under pressure to meet the growing demands of both the courts and the Prison Service. This has led to some delays in the provision of reports to courts and in the implementation of probation and community service orders. These are some of the issues which are currently being examined by my Department.</P>
        <P>In terms of the future organisation and structure of the service, I have set up a small working group involving departmental and probation and welfare officials to build on existing work, including the expert group report and the value for money audit of the service, to identify: the type of services that may be required in the future; their relative priority; the resource implications and different methods of providing the services; and the research and evaluation available or required to determine the effectiveness of options. The group is expected to report before the end of this year.</P>

	<P>My proposal to increase the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 members on a phased basis over a number of years was approved by the Government in October 2004 in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government. The number of garda&iacute; assigned to the traffic corps, which was established in November 2004, will increase from the current level of approximately 530 to 1,200 by 2008.</P>
        <P>The assignment of garda&iacute; to the traffic corps will be done on a phased basis in tandem with the recruitment of almost 1,100 recruits in each of the next three years. In addition, the Government recently approved the appointment of an additional assistant commissioner, who the commissioner has appointed to take responsibility for traffic matters, including the traffic corps.</P>
        <P>The methods employed by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the detection or prevention of any offence are an operational matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and I have no direct role relating to them. Both overt and covert enforcement activities are carried out by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as both have a role to play in an effective enforcement programme. Furthermore, both covert and high visibility checkpoints are operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to detect speeding motorists. The locations for these checkpoints are determined by the collision prevention programme, which identifies collision prone locations. These locations are then targeted for checkpoints with a view to detecting speeding motorists, changing driver behaviour and, ultimately, reducing death and injuries on our roads.</P>

        <P>A working group on speed cameras chaired by my Department and consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Transport and the National Roads Authority is examining a range of issues concerning speed cameras, including the parameters for outsourcing their provision and operation and the interaction of any private sector operation with other agencies. Work is well advanced on preparing proposals and the group is due to report to me and the Minister for Transport shortly. We will then consider the issues arising from the report&rsquo;s recommendations and, having done so, we will consider presenting proposals to Government.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</P>
        <P>My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school referred to by the Deputy was 197 pupils.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180, 181, 186, 189, 190, 191 and 193 together.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, on foot of a major review of Irish language policies carried out in the Department last year, has recently prepared an internal report for policy discussion. The Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, along with other interest groups, contributed to that process. The principal recommendations highlight the need for improvements in teacher training to sustain communicative approaches at both primary and second level, a greater emphasis on oral competence in pre-service training, improvements in the supply of resource materials and additional courses for those studying for the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh C&aacute;il&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge. The report also recommends that the increase in pupils being granted exemptions from Irish should be addressed.</P>
        <P>My Department is investing significantly to address these issues. In particular, major improvements are being made on the provision of materials and resources for the teaching of Irish. An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta has been established to progress this area and to provide support services for <Col N="1108"/>schools. Extensive in-service training has been provided to teachers in the teaching of Irish, emphasising a communicative approach. Marino Institute of Education now provides courses at different levels and an enhanced range of supports for those studying for the Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh Cail&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge. A new circular on exemptions from Irish is currently being drafted. However, much remains to be done and these issues will be further progressed in the light of available resources.</P>
        <P>The Scr&uacute;d&uacute; le hAghaidh Cail&iacute;ochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, is a requirement for recognition in the case of teachers who completed their training in another EU member state. Such entrants to teaching here have been trained mainly in the United Kingdom. The change in the marking of the SCG arose from the recommendations of a working group, established in 2001, to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination. Institi&uacute;id Teangeola&iacute;ochta &Eacute;ireann, the colleges of education, primary school management organisations, INTO, National Parents Council, primary, and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were all represented on this working group. Its report was published on my Department&rsquo;s website in 2004.</P>
        <P>The SCG was the minimum standard required to teach Irish in mainstream primary schools, in Gaeltacht schools and in all Irish schools up to 2004. Since many candidates did not intend teaching in Gaeltacht or all-Irish schools, it was inappropriate to require the same standard of Irish of all teachers. The group recommended a differentiated approach under which those who gained 70% or more in the examination would be eligible to teach in Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools, while those who gained a pass grade would be recognised for English medium schools. The group recommended the pass mark for all modules be reduced from 50% to 40%, in line with the pass mark commonly used at third level. Entry to primary teacher training in Ireland requires a minimum of grade C at higher level in leaving certificate Irish.</P>
        <P>The position on the teaching and learning of Irish will be continuously reviewed and a range of further evaluations and studies in this area is under way. This will be important in helping to bring about sustained improvements, particularly in the area of oral competence and communicative approaches. However, it is an accepted tenet of linguistic research that a language will struggle where a society does not create an environment for its active everyday use.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182, 183, 184, 185, 187 and 188 together.</P>
        <P>Under the auspices of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, curricula at both primary and second level have been reformed and are now based on internationally recognised language learning principles developed through research work under the auspices of the Council of Europe and other international bodies. In line with these principles, the curricula place an emphasis on oral language competency, including listening and speaking skills.</P>
        <P>My Department&rsquo;s inspectorate, on foot of a major review of Irish language policies carried out in the Department last year, has recently prepared an internal report for policy discussion. The Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, along with other interest groups, contributed to that process.

	<P>A working group was set up in autumn 1997 to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags. The terms of <Col N="1112"/>reference of the working group were to consider the issue of heavy schoolbags and, in particular, the extent of the problem, the factors which contribute to the problem and possible implications of the problem, particularly for the health of pupils. The group was also asked to formulate proposals to alleviate problems associated with the weight of schoolbags. The group presented its report in July 1998.</P>
        <P>The group&rsquo;s report outlined a number of recommendations that had implications not only for my Department but also for schools, parents and publishers. A copy of this report may be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website. The report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and one of the main recommendations related to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
        <P>In this regard my Department initiated an awareness raising campaign at primary and post-primary levels by disseminating the report with an accompanying circular to all primary and post-primary schools. Furthermore, information leaflets and posters were also distributed to all schools highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem. It is a matter for each school to choose those measures that would be most suited to its individual needs.</P>
        <P>Positive action has been taken by many schools. Actions taken by some schools at second level consist of a range of measures including the provision of lockers, the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</P>
        <P>While the report acknowledges that heavy schoolbags pose a potential hazard it points out that many factors contribute to the problem and it therefore follows that any solution requires action not just from my Department and school authorites but also from parents, publishers of educational books and, indeed, from students themselves. In the circumstances I would not accept that it would be appropriate for my Department to accept responsibility for any injuries purportedly arising from the weight of schoolbags.</P>

	<P>Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second level, mainly in the case of language subjects, school textbooks are not approved or prescribed by my Department at first or second level. Decisions on which books to use are taken at school level.</P>
        <P>The publication and sale of school books are in the hands of independent commercial enterprises and it is not open to me to compel publishing companies to produce texts in a particular format. However, the attention of educational publishers was drawn to the recommendations for publishers contained in the report of the working group on the weight of schoolbags circulated to all schools in 1998.</P>
        <P>One of the main recommendations of the report of the working group was that my Department should initiate an awareness raising campaign on the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and, to this end, information leaflets and posters were sent to all schools highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags and outlining a range of local measures that could be adopted to alleviate the problem.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are currently being made by my Department to issue a further circular on the weight of schoolbags to all schools and a copy of this circular will be forwarded to the Irish Educational Publishers Association.</P>

	<P>The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners.</P>
        <P>The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29 it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005 to 2006 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</P>
        <P>According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school refered to by the Deputy was 439 pupils. The staffing for the 2005 to 2006 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</P>
        <P>Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996 to 1997 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003 to 2004 school year. In line with Government policy my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</P>

        <P>However, since he entered the school the NEPS psychologist has engaged in a number of consultations with school staff to advise them on how best to manage the student&rsquo;s behaviour.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.</P>
        <P>Under the Defence Forces pension schemes the minimum service required for an immediate pension in the case of NCOs and privates is 21 years. The pension for 21 years service consists of the following elements: a basic flat rate pension which varies according to rank; an addition in respect of military service allowance, MSA, in the case of qualified personnel discharged since August 1990; and an addition in respect of technician pay and certain other additional payments that were made during service. All of these elements of pension are payable for the lifetime of the pensioner.</P>
        <P>Where service exceeds 21 years the Defence Forces pension is increased by an additional increment for each such year of service up to a <Col N="1117"/>maximum of 31 years. This additional increment is payable at a flat rate for each year of service with a small increase if the individual qualifies for the latter addition mentioned above. A top up of the MSA addition is also payable in the case of personnel with 31 or more years&rsquo; service. These extra payments cease to be payable when the pensioner reaches the qualifying age of 66 years for an old age contributory pension or becomes entitled at an earlier age to a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
        <?oasys _cl10.5-?>
        <P>These arrangements are in accordance with the principle of integration of occupational pensions with social insurance benefits in the case of employees, such as NCOs and privates, who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts. This principle applies across the public service and in many areas of the private sector. I should say, however, that the method of applying the integration principle in the case of retired NCOs and privates is less severe than that applying in other areas of the public service.</P>
        <P>The person referred to reached 66 years of age on 21 January 2005 and the arrangements mentioned were applied to his Defence Forces pension from that date.</P>
        <P>The general issue of integration of occupational pensions in the public service was examined by the commission on public service pensions in its final report published in January 2001. The commission accepted that integration is a fundamental component in the public service pensions framework and was strongly of the view that it should be continued. It did not make any recommendations that would affect the current integration arrangements applicable to retired NCOs and privates.</P>

	<P>The Government on 15 July 1998 approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Dublin.</P>
        <P>The sale of approximately 97 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, County Cork, was completed in 2003 for a total of &euro;42 million. The majority of the land was purchased by O&rsquo;Flynn Construction. The sale of a site comprising approximately 2.7 acres to the Southern Heath Board for &euro;1.73 million was completed last December. It was agreed at that time to transfer an area comprising approximately 27 acres at Murphy Barracks to Cork County Council for <Col N="1118"/>community use and title to this area is currently being transferred to the council. Agreement has also been reached for the sale of a site comprising approximately 1.7 acres to the Department of Education and Science for approximately &euro;1.1 million. A half acre site has been set aside on foot of a request from the Office of Public Works for a plot of ground to facilitate extension to the existing Garda station located on Main Street, Ballincollig.</P>
        <P>A site comprising 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald camp, Fermoy, County Cork, was sold for &euro;973,889 to Cork County Council in 2001 for development in conjunction with the IDA. Castleblayney military post, County Monaghan, which comprised approximately ten acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for &euro;761,843 in 2002. At Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare seven acres were ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for &euro;8,888,167. The remaining one acre of that barracks&rsquo; lands was sold to Kildare County Council for &euro;380,921 in 2002.</P>
        <P>Clancy Barracks, Dublin, which is a site comprising approximately 13.65 acres, was sold to Florence Properties Limited for &euro;25.4 million in 2004. The Government decided in July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare, County Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative. The modalities of the transfer of this property as well as lands at Gormanston, County Meath, St. Bricin&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin, and Collins Barracks, Cork, to the relevant local authorities are under active consideration in consultation with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>The Government decided in February 2000 in the context of the White Paper on defence that all the proceeds from sales of surplus military properties would be reinvested in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Disposals involving a number of other military properties surplus to requirements were also completed during the period since 1997. The principal properties were as follows: 6.39 acres adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, and known as Susan&rsquo;s Field was sold to Cork City Council for &euro;1.523 million; approximately 3.4 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, was disposed of to Limerick City Council for &euro;1.162 million; a site comprising approximately 0.931 acre adjacent to my Department&rsquo;s FCA premises in Kanturk, County Cork, was disposed of to the Southern Health Board for a consideration of &euro;0.178 million; approximately 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks was sold to Waterford City Council for &euro;0.662 million; the sale by public tender of Belmont Huts, Cobh, County Cork, which comprised approximately 2.89 acres, to a Wexford based partnership for &euro;2.4 million was completed during 2004; and 100 married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare, are being sold to the occupants. Sales to date have realised over &euro;3 million. Total sales are expected to realise approximately &euro;4 million.</P><Col N="1119"/>
        <P>The value of sales and disposals completed since 1997 totals in the region of &euro;90 million.</P>
