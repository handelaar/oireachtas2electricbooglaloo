    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaudgeConnolly"><NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, in view of the vastly increased volumes of non-English speaking non-Irish nationals presenting at hospital accident and emergency units, the fact that their primary illness may be compounded by anxiety, reactions to separation from family and their cultural and ethnic beliefs, their inability to <Col N="2"/>communicate their symptoms to hospital staffs and failure to understand staff members&rsquo; explanation and advice, the need to avoid delays, misdiagnosis and incorrect medication dosages and the necessity to obtain maximum benefit from hospital health care services, the critical need to provide basic translation facilities in the form of printed documents with admission and discharge instructions, patient care instructions, and disease information in the official EU languages and major world languages for all hospital accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need for the Government to take urgent action to provide emergency accommodation for the estimated 275 on the streets and 4,000 overall homeless persons in Dublin city and elsewhere in the face of worsening severe winter conditions; and in view of the deaths that have occurred amongst the homeless from hypothermia already this year and thereby to ensure that nobody else dies from the cold this winter and that the reasons and causes of and for homelessness are finally tackled and ended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the decision of the Health Service Executive to close Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen"><NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, to discuss the Irish Medicines Board report on the blood transfusion services centre in Cork which stated that the buildings housing the services are totally unsuitable and affect the standards of the services, despite the fact that a new purpose built centre has been promised by this Government since 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the loss of 100 jobs at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo where Mayo people are being forced to move to Portlaoise or accept shift work alternative employment for the Garda PULSE system for which they are not primarily trained and the need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, to address the lack of any effective plan for Government to have Ireland comply with the future limits being decided at Montreal on greenhouse gases other than to have the taxpayer pay for the fines which will accrue to the Government to be paid for out of the carbon fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Mr. Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to seek the adjournment of the D&aacute;il under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the remarks made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under D&aacute;il privilege, and the implications that these have for the independent watchdog body the Centre for Public Inquiry.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is proposed to take No. 15<i>a</i>, motion re referral to select committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL; No. 15<i>b</i>, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for a Council decision on the establishment of a mutual information procedure concern<Col N="4"/>ing members states&rsquo; measures in the area of asylum and immigration; and No. 22<i>a</i>, Financial Resolutions by the Minister for Finance [2005] &mdash; motion 5 (resumed).</P>
      <P>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the D&aacute;il shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tonight and business shall be interrupted not later than 7.30 p.m.; Nos. 15<i>a</i> and 15<i>b</i> shall be decided without debate; and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate on No. 22<i>a</i>: the speech of the Taoiseach and of the main spokespersons or a member nominated in his or her stead, for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case; the spokespersons for the Technical Group shall be confined to a spokesperson for the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents; and the speech of each other Member called upon, who may share their time, shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business and give the Taoiseach the following option. Either we set time aside between 12 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. or from 7.30 to 9 p.m. for an explanation the D&aacute;il should have in respect of the announced resignation of the former Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Ivor Callely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Deputy Kenny and it is important the House has the opportunity to hear a statement from the resigned Minister of State and an opportunity to discuss some of the issues. It has been claimed by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Tom Parlon, that the resignation of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport is the result of a political conspiracy. If this is so, does the Taoiseach accept the political conspiracy did not come from this side of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate that now as we are dealing with Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not debate it now but I am adding my voice to the request. We should certainly have an opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>An amendment that would introduce a new matter is not in order as it is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s prerogative to list the business to be taken. On the question of the proposal that there be a late sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has not asked for my views on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="5"/>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle knows from his experience that on many occasions in the past, the Order of Business in the House has been amended, with the acceptance of the Taoiseach, either for an extension of time or for a change of business and such an amendment will be facilitated now by Members on this side of the House. It is in the public interest that this should happen and I am quite sure the Taoiseach will accommodate us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Callely is probably very anxious to speak on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the matter of the late sitting, Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no need. We have heard the proposal and we will hear from the Taoiseach now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>The Ceann Comhairle has not heard from me at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Callely is very anxious to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in order that I respond to the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s question regarding opposition <Col N="6"/>to the late sitting. The late sitting will not give us the opportunity to deal with the business in hand. The Taoiseach has brought the business into the House himself and I understand why. However, it is valid that we would hear, not just from the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, but also from the Taoiseach as to whether this signifies a reassurance that there is no other issue concerning a situation where a construction interest would have offered to carry out work &mdash; a reassurance, that, for example, no construction company offered to do work on St. Luke&rsquo;s in Drumcondra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>That is dirty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am simply seeking assurances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We know the kind of assurances Deputy Sargent would want. We are debating the budget today.</P>

	<P>It is important to note that this is a matter for concern. When the Taoiseach contributed in the House on 3 December 1996 regarding the resignation of former Minister, Deputy Lowry, he said:</P>
      <P LI="1">A Minister&rsquo;s obligations do not cease just because he has resigned. Resignation is not an excuse for going to ground and hoping that the public lose interest. That would be a travesty of accountability. The public are entitled to know the full reasons for his resignation, and why the facts of the case were incompatible with his remaining in office ... Deputy Lowry has a duty to satisfy D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the supreme authority in the land and the one to which he remains answerable.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The case made by Deputies must be answered and we need an explanation in the public interest about whether the Minister of State resigned or was sacked, whether there was a conspiracy or whether the Minister for State, in his previous capacity, briefed the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on the issue of long-stay charges in public institutions.</P>

	<P>I wish to respond to the formal request made by Deputy Kehoe, the Fine Gael Whip, for a debate on the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely. I have checked as best I can with regard to precedent and I am led to believe that in the case of the resignations of the then Ministers of State, Deputy Hogan and Mr. Bobby Molloy, a statement was made by the Deputies in question. There was no debate. I have consulted the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and he does not wish to make a statement.</P>

	<P>I ask Deputies to listen. In such cases, I make an announcement for the information of the House. I announced this morning that I accepted the resignation from office of the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. He tendered his resignation as Minister of State in writing and I accepted it. He did so, according to his letter, in the public interest in view of the fact that the ongoing controversies made it impossible for him to carry out his ministerial duties effectively and productively.

      <P>I thank Deputy Callely for his dedicated contribution to the work of the Government in his role at the Departments of Health and Children and Transport in the last three years. If the Deputy wishes to make a personal statement, it is totally open to him, or any Deputy, to do so. It is a very difficult day for Deputy Callely.

	<P>The Government ordered the business today and, as has always been the practice on the day following a budget, the Taoiseach and the leaders or spokespersons of Opposition parties make their statements. That process normally happens straight after the Order of Business. It is a matter for Deputy Callely whether he, at any stage during the day or next week, wishes to make a statement. He is not bound by any rule of the D&aacute;il, the Government, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party or anyone else.</P>

We cannot and we should not want to force anyone to make a statement, but the House deserves an explanation of these bizarre and sinister happenings.

	<P>I do not know anything about why this has happened. The former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has said it was bizarre and sinister that this matter emerged close to and on the day of the budget. It is obvious that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was not fully informed when he said this was the next best thing to a conspiracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Taoiseach that no Deputy would want to force another Member of the House to make a personal statement if he or she does not want to do so. I accept that there is a contradiction in a Member being quite happy to make several statements outside the House but not being willing to address the House at all for whatever reason. There is no compulsion on Deputy Callely or any other Member to make a personal statement in the House. There are issues surrounding the resignation of the former Minister of State which are important in terms of the functioning of the Government. The central issue about which I am concerned is the claim by the Minister, Deputy Martin, that he was not aware of the nursing homes issue.</P>

	<P>The issue that arises, which could be resolved outside this Chamber, is the proposal of my colleague, Deputy Broughan, that a 15-minute opportunity be provided to enable the Whips to meet.

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept what the Taoiseach has said. It is true that many Deputies have considerable sympathy, from a personal point of view, for the difficult position in which Deputy Callely has found himself today. Given that the D&aacute;il will not meet again before next Tuesday, it is likely that the speculation about the reasons for Deputy Callely&rsquo;s resignation as Minister of State will gather momentum over the weekend. The Taoiseach might then regret that it was not possible to allow this matter to be debated in the House today and finalised to the point of satisfying whatever need there is to know the circumstances behind the resignation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to facilitate a brief suspension of the D&aacute;il so that arrangements can be put in place to give him an opportunity to make a brief statement. I suspect that the Taoiseach knows as much about Deputy Callely&rsquo;s resignation as the Deputy himself. The former Minister of State should also be allowed to say what has to be said in a formalised way.</P>

It is regrettable that so much critical time has been lost at a time when the House is scheduled to discuss something of such importance as the budget. I appeal to the Taoiseach to be mindful of the need of Members to have the matter substantively addressed. Deputy Callely has made his choice.  That is his decision and he cannot be compelled to address the House. I appeal to the <Col N="44"/>Taoiseach to avail of the opportunity to put the issues before the House firmly on the record, to explain the situation and to have the record stand accordingly.</P>

This is my statement; I will have no more to say on the matter. Deputy Callely has been involved in a number of controversies, all of which are in the public domain, over a period of some time. The controversies have made his life and his job impossible to carry out. He set that out for me in a letter today. He thinks the way he has been treated has been very unfair, but he accepts that it has made his job impossible and I accept that position. He is a hard-working person, but he has become involved in these controversies which have not done him or anyone else much good. He accepts that position. That is my statement; I have no more to say. It is politically mischievous to raise other issues about Deputy Callely&rsquo;s past and the Ministers under whom he has worked. That is the end of my statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the budget of a successful economy which continues to outperform practically all the other economies in the developed world. The budget is designed to enhance social solidarity and improve the quality of life for young families and older people. It is constructed in the spirit of social partnership that has served this country well for almost 20 years. It continues the ambitious programme of improvements across the board in the public services. The budget provides further compelling evidence of the consistently high quality of stewardship in the Government&rsquo;s management of the country&rsquo;s affairs. We will be glad to submit our record to the people for their judgment in 18 months when we seek a renewal of our mandate.</P>
      <P>Governments in other countries, like previous Governments in this country, must grapple with lower growth than forecast, high unemployment and persistent overshoots in targeted borrowing. The current situation in this country is the opposite of that as we are looking forward to satisfactory growth of close to 5% for the third year in a row. A dynamic level of employment growth of almost 5% has involved the creation of an additional 96,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Some 2 million people will be employed by early in 2006, which will represent an increase of more than 500,000 people in employment since 1997. It is likely that by 2007, the number of people employed will have increased by 1 million since 1987.</P>
      <P>Buoyant revenue growth, which can never be taken for granted, has meant that we have significantly undershot the modest level of borrowing that was projected in the 2005 budget. We will end up with a small general Government surplus, as we have done in all but one year since 1997. <Col N="46"/>As a result, substantial resources are available to the Government to relieve the tax burden on the low paid and hard-pressed working families; to increase the volume of spending on social services, focusing on greatest need; and to invest in infrastructural improvements which we could not afford in the past and which many other jurisdictions cannot afford today. It is forecast that inflation will remain in historically low single figures next year. We now obtain much better value from capital spending. The overall level of expenditure remains at a constant 33% of gross domestic product. Gross current spending has been increasing at roughly the same level &mdash; approximately 10% &mdash; each year since 2002. We must guard against overheating an economy at full throttle or causing sudden jolts when things are going so well.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the most impressive and sustained growth record of all of the countries surveyed by the National Competitiveness Council in its recent report. Our rate of unemployment is half the European average, <i>pro rata</i>. Our labour force is growing at record rates as a result of inward migration and a higher rate of participation by our own people. The level of infrastructural development through investment is more than twice the European average. The Government has provided for continuing developments in the quality and extent of our social services. For example, there have been substantial increases in the real incomes of those who depend on social welfare. Such statistics represent an exceptionally positive balance sheet for the Government. The aim of the 2006 budget is to underpin the strong confidence that has been a marked feature of the economy in recent years so that we can continue to make dynamic progress of a kind that has never been sustained before in our history.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the Government&rsquo;s progressive social philosophy of democratic republicanism, another of its priorities is to ensure that there is justice and fairness in the tax system. The Exchequer should not continue to offer unlimited incentives to the wealthiest tax residents in society at the expense of the general taxpayer. It is not right that a few of them would contribute nothing by way of income tax directly to the State or that we would publicly assist further accumulation of very substantial pension funds without any limit. People in that fortunate situation are well able beyond a certain point to look after themselves. To be fair, most of them are contributing heavily in more ways than one to the running costs of this society. Those few affected by these changes will still enjoy a very favourable tax environment compared to most other countries. It should also be stressed that the top 4% of income earners pay 40% of the total take from income tax.</P>
      <P>A whole array of construction incentives, which were always meant to be finite, have served their purpose. With some exceptions, such as park and ride, which is obviously relevant to the roll-out of <Col N="47"/>Transport 21, and private health care provision, they should no longer be needed to stimulate activity. The provision of student accommodation, thanks to an incentive introduced in 1998, for instance, has been very successful, but has now served its purpose.</P>
      <P>Writers and artists will still have exemption on annual income up to &euro;250,000. The vast majority of artists fall well below this threshold. Before the stallion fee exemption runs out at a time when all the other relevant reliefs end, we will consult closely with the industry and the European Commission to come up with an effective alternative that takes account of the importance of the success of this industry not only to Ireland but also to Europe.</P>
      <P>Our reforming approach to the tax system has been designed to underpin a more enterprising and fairer society, through a pragmatic approach to the various components of the tax system. Fundamentally, our objective has to be to generate the maximum resources available for redistribution consistent with fostering a dynamic and sustainable enterprise sector. Our commitment is to a clear and transparent corporate tax regime, which, with many other highly attractive features of Ireland as a business location, has brought about substantial investment, and increased activity, employment and, crucially, tax revenue.</P>
      <P>This budget, like last year&rsquo;s, is once again characterised by no increases in direct or indirect taxes, thus helping to keep down inflation, and ensuring that the budget does not put pressure on prices in the family shopping basket. We have reduced excise on certain heating oils, which will be of benefit particularly to older people and which over the years will eliminate a North-South difference that provides an incentive for irregular trade. The phased-in removal or capping of incentives will broaden the tax base and have positive revenue flow implications in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>We have developed a structure of taxation, which provides incentives for those who wish to work and employ others, and which distributes the burden of income tax fairly among those best able to meet it. The exemption of those on the current minimum wage from the tax net &mdash; despite our minimum wage rate being one of the most attractive in Europe &mdash; combined with our low rate of taxation on those on approximately average earnings, have produced a highly equitable and progressive income tax system. It will be a constant task in every budget to make sure that those working full-time on the minimum wage, which is likely to rise each year, stay out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>The total full-year cost of income tax relief goes up from &euro;682 million in 2005 to &euro;900 million in next year&rsquo;s budget. Once again, it is concentrated on low to middle-income groups. Some 36% of all income taxpayers will pay no tax. The rest will be equally distributed between the stan<Col N="48"/>dard and higher tax bands. The standard tax band is being increased by &euro;2,600, or nearly 9%, compared with &euro;1,400, or 5%, last year. The standard income tax band has now been effectively protected in real terms since 2002.</P>
      <P>The primary objective must be to ensure that we keep those on the average industrial wage out of the tax net, which we have done, unlike our predecessors. Wise governments avoid automatic and unthinking index linking by sometimes doing more and sometimes less to retain necessary flexibility to manage the economy and the public finances, and inject resources into what may have become new priority areas. I doubt if many people would wish us to index-link excise duties by reference to an automatic scale. They had to abandon such linkages in other EU member states when economic priorities changed.</P>
      <P>As has been the case in all budgets since 2002, a study of the tables showing who benefits presents a picture of progressive tax changes, with the proportional benefit concentrated on the middle to lower end. Tax equity has been our priority. By preserving incentives, especially at lower income levels, and by keeping the tax wedge at a generally low level, we have produced an environment in which almost 2 million of our people are at work and unemployment, especially long-term unemployment that was once chronic, is at historically low levels.</P>
      <P>Another feature of the budget is the support it gives to small business by relieving their tax and administrative burden. Targeted special reliefs will enhance protection of our environment and heritage, helping to implement our Kyoto commitments and establishing the heritage trust which I proposed in the early autumn.</P>
      <P>I turn to the purposes for which the revenue raised through our equitable and balanced taxation system will be applied. The major initiative of this budget is to make inroads into the problem of the cost and supply of child care. There has been much public debate about whether the European model of society can continue and whether the welfare state has had its day. Trading labels of that kind is not always particularly helpful. However, if we must have a label, I believe our policies are designed to build up what the NESC in a recent report called the &ldquo;Developmental Welfare State&rdquo;. This involves combining income supports, well targeted services and appropriately innovative measures to help individuals, families and communities not only to access quality services, but also to achieve their full potential and, in particular, to maximise their independence, autonomy and contribution to society.</P>
      <P>These are the principles which were already expressed in our national anti-poverty strategy, our national children&rsquo;s strategy and the national disability strategy, which was published earlier this year. What these different approaches have in common is that they set out the standard of services which we aim to provide as a recognition <Col N="49"/>of the rights of our citizens, improved arrangements to develop a joined-up approach on the part of Government to developing policy and a greater degree of integration at a local level in delivering services and supports which reflect the needs of people. In doing this, we have recognised the particular milestones in people&rsquo;s lives, where particular types of support and encouragement are required, be it in respect of children, young adults at the stage of establishing a family, independent adults in the workforce, older people or those with disabilities or other restrictions on their autonomy.</P>
      <P>This is the context within which the Government&rsquo;s policy on child care has been developed, through a careful combination of measures to stimulate the availability and supply of child care and measures to support those in need of child care services. We have taken this balanced approach, and set out how we propose to develop it over a number of years, in response to the obvious facts about child care. In particular, we know that if we relied only on putting more money into the purchasing of child care services without increasing its supply, the likelihood is that prices would soon rise. We also recognise that parents have, legitimately, differing views about the best type of child care for their children. Some people will wish to provide care in the home themselves, either for a period after the birth of a child or for the pre-school years. Others will wish to use part-time nurseries and cr&egrave;ches, while working in the home. Many will wish to place children in a family home setting, using the services of family members or neighbours. Others will wish to have the benefits of structured child care programmes in well-run and regulated centres.</P>
      <P>The package of measures announced by the Minister for Finance provides recognition and support for that full range of choice. They also provide a particular focus on the needs of families and communities with the greatest needs and under the greatest pressures. The package also recognises the importance of the development of the child as a specific objective in its own right, within the broader child care needs of the family. The extension of paid and unpaid maternity leave will be widely welcomed.</P>
      <P>Supply is vitally important. I have had pleasure in opening publicly funded as well as voluntarily organised family resource centres in different parts of the country. The &euro;10,000 income tax and PRSI disregard for those who look after up to three children, who are not their own, in the minder&rsquo;s home will also have a measurable impact on increased supply and help to keep down costs. This is certainly one instance where we are better off regularising the informal economy. Child benefit has been transformed and is now four to five times its value in 1997. The new child care payment of &euro;1,000 per year extra in cash for children under six is the equivalent of a &euro;5,000 tax allowance at the standard rate per child.</P><Col N="50"/>
      <P Just="Left">The multi-annual strategy for child care announced by the Minister for Finance requires an equally ambitious strategy to improve the arrangements for developing and implementing our policies on child care. Excellent work has been carried out by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department in developing the equal opportunities child care programme. However, at present, that responsibility is separated from policy in respect of standards, registration and inspection of child care facilities in the Department of Health and Children, while education in early years is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. To bring greater coherence to the sector, the Government has decided that responsibility for the child care programme will transfer from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Department of Health and Children and, as is normal in these situations, the relevant staff will also transfer. Therefore, the expertise and network of contacts which have developed will continue to be available to the child care area.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Responsibility for child care, together with other aspects of policy for children generally, is delegated to the Minister of State, with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The Government has decided to take this opportunity to bring greater coherence to this important area of public policy. Accordingly, the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children will have responsibility not only for child care, but for child protection and welfare, for juvenile justice and for early years education, reflecting the Minister&rsquo;s responsibilities in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science, respectively. To the greatest extent possible, all of the staff involved will be brought together in this office. There will be an overall head of office in the Department of Health and Children, reporting to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The Minister of State will attend Cabinet regularly in furtherance of his responsibilities for children. Further details of these arrangements will be announced by Deputy Lenihan, following consultation with the relevant staff interests.</P>
      <P>This budget represents a major step forward for children and families not only in terms of the resources provided, but in terms of a more effective and joined-up approach to this critical area of public policy. An equally important aspect of our budget strategy is the strong commitment to share the current prosperity of our society with those who are retired as well as the less fortunate. We are honouring our commitments to our older citizens who have served this country in their families, communities and workplaces over the years.</P>
      <P>We are meeting our commitments to provide more realistic incomes for those dependent on the old age pension, which is within easy striking <Col N="51"/>distance of &euro;200 per week. We are also honouring our commitments in respect of the most vulnerable, those in receipt of the lowest rates of social welfare payment, including those in receipt of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare, who receive an increase of &euro;17 per week or 11%. This is far in excess of the 2.5%, 3% or 4% budgetary increases that were for a long time the norm under previous regimes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Enabling all our citizens to live life with dignity is a commitment we have made in the national anti-poverty strategy and in our agreements with the social partners. We are taking practical and effective steps to recognise and support the invaluable role of carers. We are also taking the opportunity to make more flexible some of the conditions which apply to the receipt of social welfare payments, to encourage people to maximise their independence and to contribute to the common good if they wish, through undertaking some paid work. It would not be right that they alone would be prevented from supplementing their income within reasonable limits.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is right that at a time of buoyant incomes and record employment levels we should create the opportunity for the less well-off to share in the success of our society. We are doing this in a way that reflects the mutual obligation on all of us to support the less well off, but also the obligation on every citizen to provide for his or her needs and to contribute to the greatest extent possible to the common good through their active participation in the workforce and in society. This is a record &euro;1,120 million social welfare package. It is an enormous welfare package at a time when unemployment is at historically low levels and the economy is in such a good state with the vast majority of our people working.</P>
      <P>The very substantial resources we are committing through this budget to the development of public services and the building up of our physical infrastructure make it essential that we use these resources to best effect. Waste and inefficiency are no more acceptable in the context of the very large resources made available in this year&rsquo;s budget and Book of Estimates than when resources were much more constrained. That is why the modernisation of the public service is of crucial importance to the Government. We need to maintain progress in the streamlining of our administrative and regulatory systems, and the updating of our work practices and use of technology. In fairness, much has been achieved in these areas, as evidenced by the independent performance verification groups for the different sectors of the public service.</P>
      <P>However, we need to ensure that best practice standards are operated in our public departments and agencies. In particular, we need the flexibility of staff at all levels, and their willingness to <Col N="52"/>embrace change including new technology if the goals for a successful society and economy are to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The budget also demonstrates the continuing commitment of this Government to creating a modem, world-class physical infrastructure to serve our people for the 21st century. The extent of that commitment is evident, both from the specific additional capital investment announced by the Minister in the budget yesterday, but also from the detailed provisions set out in the Book of Estimates published last month. In total, capital expenditure in the coming year will amount to more than &euro;9 billion, equivalent in terms of the net Exchequer contribution to 5% of GNP. This is double the European average.</P>
      <P>Transport 21 is a bold and ambitious programme to address not only the inherited transport deficit, but to anticipate the growth in population and commerce for the decades ahead. What is important is not just the scale of that financial commitment, dramatic though that is &mdash; but the focused and effective manner in which it will be managed. The enhanced project management system within the transport sector has been steadily delivering infrastructure projects within budget and ahead of time. It is no secret that the substantial ramping up of capital expenditure in transport put strains on our administrative, planning and management systems. What is clear is that these challenges have been met and we have developed both our capacities and our policies. Managing large projects of this nature requires consistency and continuity, as well as a process and contracting changes to deliver value for money. That is why the Government decided to introduce a ten year capital envelope for transport investment, thus providing both the timeframe and the confidence to ensure value for money in the planning and execution of our ambitious transport plans.</P>
      <P>Our productive capacity is also dependent on the quality of our people, their qualifications and skills. That is why providing high quality educational facilities at all levels is of such a high priority to the Government. The provision for the development of new schools for a growing population, and the upgrading and refurbishment of literally hundreds of primary and post-primary schools, are evidence of that commitment. It is also critical that we continue to develop our talent base of graduates and researchers. That is why the Government has made a further commitment not only to the ongoing development of our third level sector, but also to its transformation, and to the development of a fourth level system meeting the highest international standards in important areas of research and development.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Developing our physical infrastructure extends beyond the economy&rsquo;s productive capacity to underpinning the quality of life of our people. In particular, our capital investment in health care, both hospitals and community-based facilities, provides a clear expression of our commitment to <Col N="53"/>the modernisation and greater effectiveness of the health services. The challenge is not only to provide substantial additional resources, but to manage them in a way that reduces unnecessary strains on the system.</P>
      <P>In addition to flexibility and modernisation, value for money in public services also requires that our wage bill remains reasonable. Pay costs in the public service represent a high percentage of total expenditure, to a greater extent than in the enterprise sector of the economy. We must ensure that wage costs are managed and that any pay increases are realistic, having regard to our low inflation environment and to trends in productivity compared to international norms.</P>
      <P>As a small society, we have an innate capacity to move quickly and to anticipate change. We also have the capacity to engage in dialogue with one another and to work together for the benefit of a real, national common interest. The social partnership framework which we have operated since 1987 provides a tried and tested mechanism to realise that potential. It has delivered in the past. It can deliver again, not only for trade unions and their members, but also for employers and the enterprise sector, including farmers, through its contribution to the successful management of change, and for the wider community, through the stability and confidence which industrial harmony and a shared understanding can provide. I strongly believe that early engagement between the social partners and the Government, and early agreement on a new social partnership framework, would be in the best interests of the entire community. The measures announced in the budget should significantly help to underpin progress towards such an agreement.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This budget provides the means by which we can consolidate our strong growth and development, based on high employment and rising productivity into the future. It provides a generous and sustainable response to the needs of those who are most at risk in our society. It provides realistic and effective support for families and children facing the pressures of life in a modem and dynamic economy. Above all, it provides evidence that this Government continues to honour its commitments to manage our economic and social affairs with care and imagination and to balance securing long-term growth with more immediate improvements in the quality of life of our people.</P>
      <P>I commend the second budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to the House and congratulate him on his considerable achievement.</P>

	<P>I regret the House had to wait so long this morning to hear the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech. It is a cause of concern that the House did not agree to set aside some time to discuss the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, and the implications that will undoubtedly follow.</P><Col N="54"/>
      <P Just="Left" LI="1">As a society we now face a new set of problems. The cost of child care has risen dramatically. This places an enormous burden on people trying to raise a family and work outside the home. Despite increased prosperity and greater opportunities, there is a growing sense that improvements in the quality of life are not keeping pace. In our towns and cities congestion is increasing, undermining the quality of life for many of our citizens. We must provide a first-class infrastructure, better transport, roads and housing in order to improve the quality of life for our citizens.</P>
      <P FLI="0">How true. The problem is though, those are not my words, they are the Government&rsquo;s. That was its verdict on the state of the nation at the time of budget 2000. Six years and six budgets later we see no change. Since 1997, &euro;266 billion was spent to achieve remarkably little. We have the same tired old promises, team and problems with Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs, and the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I am glad today is a good day for many people throughout Ireland. They listened to the news, read the papers and find they will be a little bit better off, and it is about time. However, let me disavow the Government of its vision and propaganda that this budget is some miraculous ATM stocked up for the people out of its own largesse. Altruistic Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs, even in the season of make-believe, is a fiction too far. The money the Government is spending in this budget is the people&rsquo;s own money. Let us be clear it is not a give-away budget. This is a budget about giving back.</P>
      <P>It has taken this Government, not one, two, three, four or five budgets, but nine budgets to recognise and to give something back to the first-class people of this country who work hard, pay their taxes, rear their families and do their bit for their community. It has taken eight years and nine budgets to start giving some fair play to the people who have made our economy what it is today. I am glad that finally, the Irish people are getting some return on the huge, personal investment they make in the country because they deserve every cent they get and more. In fact, my biggest regret about this budget is that it does not give people enough. Their hard work, sacrifice, risk and ingenuity put billions into the public purse and they should get more.</P>
      <P>They could get millions more if the Government ditched its small-change mentality towards millions of euro going down the tubes, and instead examined carefully every euro and how it is spent. Never in the history of our country has a Government had so much money with which to work. Never has a Minister for Finance addressed this House in as strong a position as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was yesterday. Never in the history of our country has a Government spent so much to achieve so little and <Col N="55"/>wasted so much money without even batting an eyelid.</P>
      <P>People could be so much better off today if the country had a Government that knew the difference between spending money and investing money, that would make sure that investment follows reform, delivery, targets and results, and that would haul itself into the 21st century, keep its promises and its word. This budget is about more than putting the people&rsquo;s money back in their pockets. The budget must also be about keeping that money there in the future. In that sense, the budget must be a blueprint for the future of our country, jobs, children, security and economy.</P>
      <P>In the 21st century, international economic stakes have never been higher. In these volatile circumstances where when one country sneezes the rest of the world catches a cold, Ireland&rsquo;s quality of life, public services and future wealth and wellbeing cannot and should not be a matter of political chance. They should and must become a matter of political choice. I regret that this budget contains nothing, not the barest hint of a plan or decision, never mind a choice, to solve our country&rsquo;s problems in the health service, crime, the cost of living, to secure our future in the longer term or meet the challenges we face ahead.</P>
      <P>What happened yesterday was the injection of an unusually large amount of money in the economy. This, coupled with the money that will come from the SSIAs, will fuel a massive consumer spend, which will inevitably lead to increases in costs and prices and consequently to a further increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>This budget is the first half of a political blueprint for one purpose only, the attempt by the Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs, to survive at the next election. Some Governments change when they see the light. Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs only change when they feel the heat. They feel the heat at the elections and in the polls. This is their especially designed budget to take the heat off. It is a fire-escape budget.</P>
      <P>Their consistent neglect, waste, arrogance, complacency and detachment from the lives people live today have given us hospital waiting lists that were supposed to disappear, 2,000 extra garda&iacute; who actually did disappear, trolley watch figures that stand at 325 today and gangland executions on our streets. Children in disadvantaged areas leave school unable to read or write anything much beyond their own name. The cost of electricity and gas is going through the roof, so in the recent cold weather thousands of old people had to choose between heating and eating.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The budget might take the heat off in the short term, as a diversionary tactic, but it will not meet Ireland&rsquo;s future challenges because spending alone does not work and does not constitute a governing philosophy for any country, never mind one of the leading economies in the world. <Col N="56"/>This budget will not work to solve our problems because spending alone is the sole governing philosophy of Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs. It is proved every time I ask the Government a question through the Taoiseach. Two weeks ago in this House I read a letter from a woman whose mother was critically ill and crying with pain, but was unable to get the care she needed. His stock answer is not to tell me what he is doing to actually solve the problem, it is to tell me how much he is spending on it, as if spending money was the end in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>A history lesson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time one asks the Taoiseach a question in the morning, he reels off figures like a judge at an ice-skating contest, 9.1, 8.6, 7.5 and 6.4. The Government&rsquo;s spending follows political and election cycles but not economic cycles. Its furthest horizon is the next general election and its priority is hanging onto power together. There are always unfulfilled plans but no reforms and no acceptance of ministerial responsibility, even yesterday and today.</P>
      <P Just="Left">No one is ever to blame. In this Government, nothing is ever anyone&rsquo;s fault. Therefore, there are no results because the spend philosophy in this budget does not deal with the fundamental issue of reform in the public service. Reference was made to it in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s address, and there were some references in the address of the Minister for Finance. However, it does not deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Travers report on the examination of health levies on long-stay institutions cited long-term overall systematic corporate failure of corporate public administration. That is what it stated and this applies not only to the Department of Health and Children but to other Departments of State also. This was echoed by the Ombudsman when she addressed an Oireachtas committee in June, stating:</P>
      <P LI="1">[I]n the aftermath of the Travers report, the nature of the relationship between the Executive, between Ministers and civil servants, requires urgent attention ... [T]he wider issue is that the model of government meant to underpin and support the working of Government is no longer fully relevant.</P>
      <P>That is why we have a crisis in the Health Service Executive and other areas of the public service. Addressing the Fine Gael parliamentary party in Portlaoise, Professor Drumm stated that in the changeover from the health board system to the HSE, at least 3,000 administrative staff did not know where they fitted into the system. This is the reason for the inability to deliver effective services and the inability of one area to talk to another. The lack of monitoring resulted in the overrun in the PPARS project.</P>
      <P>Given the Government&rsquo;s alacrity on child care, one would imagine it was dealing with a state of <Col N="57"/>emergency and that the angel Gabriel appeared in the skies and made a mass visitation to every child in the country. As far back as the budget for 2000, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats were lamenting the dramatic rise in costs and the major burden on families. It took the Government until the budget for 2006 to do something about it.</P>
      <P>It was not the nation&rsquo;s children or the nation&rsquo;s families that roused the Government on child care, rather it was votes. The Government&rsquo;s change of heart on child care did not take place on the road to Damascus but on the N2, the N7 and the by-roads to Nobber and the estates of Navan at the time of the Kildare and Meath by-elections. The Government felt the heat, the issue was brought home to it at this time, it saw results and decided it was time to address the matter.</P>
      <P>This budget will not work as a fire escape or an electioneering tool because the people know they are being taken for a ride. Frankly, they are tired of the scenery. Political promises are made, public trust is invited, elections are won, Government promises are broken, public trust is abused and public confidence is shattered.</P>
      <P>From public meetings held throughout the country we know that people look at the reality of their day-to-day lives. They consider the difficulties of balancing home life and work life, killer commuting, mortgages that mean they do not have enough money left at the end of the month to put into a pension, and looking after a parent. People live through this every day and see they are not getting the services they need, value for money, or value from their vote and trust. They will never allow this to happen again. Albert Einstein, whose commemorative year this is, described insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. At the next general election, people will take that advice to heart.</P>
      <P>We should not get carried away by the spin that takes place on budget day. The torpedo fired in this budget is of a serious nature. We should never lose sight of the amount of money spent in the budget compared with overall figures and we must examine the detail of these measures.</P>
      <P>In spite of buoyant tax revenues in 2005 and very promising projections for 2006 and 2007, 32% of earners, or half of all taxpayers, will pay tax at the top rate. The Government is still a long way from meeting its target of 20% of earners paying tax at the top rate. Average earners across all sectors will continue paying tax at the same rate as high earners. So much for tax reform.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the Government received &euro;1.8 billion more than expected in taxation. In this budget, a net of &euro;1.4 billion was given back. The net value of income tax reductions was only &euro;275 million out of a total tax take of &euro;42.2 billion. So much for a low tax Government.</P>
      <P>The much-heralded package to assist older people has hardly materialised. The total package of &euro;150 million is less than the amount wasted <Col N="58"/>by the Government on the PPARS debacle. This reflects poorly on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the elderly as it still owes &euro;1 billion to elderly patients of nursing homes and has failed to introduce an effective inspection regime.</P>
      <P>The budget programme might read well in paragraphs but when one speaks to nurses in the community, considers the number of retirements taking place this year and considers that no nurses are coming on stream this year, this package is going to be difficult to implement. Trained staff, such as public health nurses, will not be available.</P>
      <P>The package for carers, &euro;27 million, got the same priority as the reduction in betting tax. The Government is still running &euro;2.5 billion behind in its capital spending programme.</P>
      <P>Given the Government&rsquo;s appalling record in implementing previous multi-annual plans, such as the health strategy, decentralisation and road safety, there is little confidence that the aspirations for increased child care places will be met. While the new early child care supplement is welcome, it will have little impact on working parents who will have to earn at least &euro;300 per week to pay for current child care costs. I am not downgrading the package which is welcome and has been promoted by this party for a long time.</P>
      <P>The &euro;1,000 payment per child is welcome but it comes with a reduced increase in child benefit of &euro;1.94 per week and no increase in child dependant allowance. The &euro;10,000 limit in respect of taxation for child care means there is no link to quality in this area. Fine Gael had a detailed proposal on this matter to make it easier for parents and better for children. Everyone understands the importance of vetting, standards and child care but those providing child care who earn more than that limit have no incentive to join in this proposal.</P>
      <P>An opportunity to announce an innovative scheme to encourage SSIA savers to continue the savings habit by investing in pensions has been lost. This will be a crucial issue in the future. This would have helped the lower paid, in particular, to invest in their pensions and is a serious missed opportunity. We see shops advertising credit terms that will allow payment for goods when SSIAs mature. This means that much of this money will be frittered away on loose credit and the Government has lost an opportunity for pensions savings.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest problems with this budget is not just in the fine print but the missing print. Energy is an example, as the budget treatment of alternative energy is risible, proving the Government has not just lost touch with life in Ireland but in the wider world. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, is in Canada today. Climate change has the capacity not just to affect day-to-day life but is quickly reaching the level where it can radically alter human existence. Judging by <Col N="59"/>this budget, the Government does not appreciate what is happening.</P>
      <P>In monetary terms alone, disregarding the higher matters of our international responsibilities, we face fines of more than &euro;400 million if we fail to meet our obligations on emissions. Credits are only a partial solution. We need a change of heart if we are to step up to the 21st century and examine our energy equation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>With the days of easy oil over, energy security is exercising every responsible government in every developed economy in the world, except Ireland. The Government is hanging the country out to dry by its stubborn refusal to recognise two issues. First, that alternative energy is critical, not just to our economic success, but to our economic survival in the future and second, that it has the potential to create thousands of new jobs and become a dynamic, sustainable sector of our economy.</P>
      <P>It would have been preferable if the Minister&rsquo;s initiative regarding biofuels had dealt with blended fuels in the first instance, which do not carry a range of high conversion costs and which would have allowed for immediate participation by the public transport network. At a time when the Minister for Agriculture and Food has single-handedly wiped out the beet industry, the Government has missed an opportunity to develop alternative growth and jobs for farmers. Furthermore, I did not see anything in the budget about the capacity that wind energy could contribute to this country over the next 20 years. Legislation currently in place deprives people of the capacity to enter that market, which is scandalous.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, a number of aspects of this budget that are welcome. If the Government is going to spend &euro;3 billion, it is bound to please some people. We have been accused on this side of the House of not producing policy programmes but in this budget I can see six policies, at least, that have been lifted from the Fine Gael website or party documents. The Taoiseach does not have to steal Deputy Joe Higgins&rsquo;s clothes all of the time. There is the issue of the &euro;1,000 payment, which was promoted by Deputy Stanton; the increased birth-related leave; the capping of tax reliefs, which Deputy Bruton has been advocating for the last three years; the reform of the Estimates process, on which we put forward a detailed document; the reduction of excise duty on biofuels, promoted by Deputy Durkan; and the increase in the VAT threshold for small businesses, which is welcome but not enough, promoted by Deputy Hogan.</P>
      <P>This budget does not address the issue of competitiveness in the way it should. Manufacturing jobs number 300,000, which is the same level as seven years ago. Approximately 100,000 of those jobs are relatively new, which means the manufacturing sector is running hard to stand still. The construction industry has been boosted to almost <Col N="60"/>250,000 employees and is a critical element of what is now driving our economy. Ten or 15 years ago, our economy was based on exports, productivity and sales. We are now in a situation where we are running hard to stand still in terms of manufacturing competitiveness and are being sustained by very strong growth in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Cowen&rsquo;s initiative on the fourth tier of education but while it represents a start, it is a very small one. I accept that Universities will have to compete for funding but perhaps we should take a more radical approach. Why, for example, are there seven chemistry faculties in Dublin alone? If we are serious about research and innovation, we must ascertain if there is a better way of dealing with the future in terms of the specialist area of PhD education. I am also not sure if this issue should be left with the Department of Education and Science. That Department is the oldest and most retrospective of all Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the most rigid Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be better if this issue was placed with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or some other Department.</P>
      <P>The budget makes a start in the area of food and health but given what has happened with the nitrates directive, which will have a serious impact on the pig and poultry sectors, the difficulties in the beef industry, the wipe-out of the beet sector and the implications of the current WTO trade negotiations, it is noteworthy that agriculture and farmers were mentioned only once in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s contribution today. The participation of farmers in social partnership programmes in the future, given what has happened recently, will be very much diminished as time goes on.</P>
      <P>We are lucky to live in times of unprecedented good fortune but the challenges we face now are not Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or Progressive Democrats challenges; they are Ireland&rsquo;s challenges. We have seen that spending alone does not work in terms of dealing with those challenges. Spending must follow fundamental reform. In the next election, people will be seeking a Government that is willing not just to spend, but to act and I give them my word that we will act.</P>
      <P>In the programme set out by the Government, its great plan, the problem of sewage disposal in towns and cities was to be eliminated by the end of 2003. That has not happened to any great extent and the Government is very much off the mark. A free travel pass for pensioners throughout Ireland was to be put in place. The programme referred to an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners. That has not happened, nor will it happen now. The programme stated that the Government&rsquo;s intent was to reduce consistent poverty to below 2%. However, the <Col N="61"/>Society of St. Vincent de Paul has recently stated that there has been a 300% increase in people contacting them for help, many of them working people. That speaks for itself. In respect of taxation, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to have only 20% of taxpayers paying at the higher rate is very far off the mark and is unlikely to be achieved. Those on the minimum wage who have been removed from the tax net this year will be back in the net next year. We have had debates here about the failure to deliver the promised 2,000 extra garda&iacute; at a time of unprecedented levels of break-ins, burglaries and vandalism on our streets. Due to the differences between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, this is an issue that is not being addressed successfully by this Government. The voluntary housing sector was supposed to deliver 4,000 units per annum. In 2002 it produced 1,360, in 2003, 1,617 and in 2004 a little over 1,000.</P>
      <P>One of the most scandalous failures of all by this Government relates to class sizes. The programme for Government said the coalition partners would &ldquo;ensure that the average size of classes for children under nine will be below the international best practice guideline of 20:1&rdquo;. Currently, the average class size is 24, which is one of the highest in the European Union. Approximately 80% of children under nine years of age are in classes of more than 20. A total of 5,000 children are in classes of more than 35, while 73,000 children are in classes of more than 30. The issue is not the pupil-teacher ratio but class sizes. When the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, who appears to be tied down to the unions completely, makes an announcement of the appointment of several hundred extra teachers, it is not related to the increase in population or the impact it will make on class sizes. That is where the problem lies. Teachers, no matter how good they may be, cannot do their job with the resources they have, if they have 30, 35 or more pupils in their classrooms. It is a physical, mental and educational impossibility. That is a fundamental failure of this Government which has not been addressed in this budget.</P>
      <P>The budget contains nothing on pre-school learning, which is so important for developing an environment for learning, teaching and acceptance of new ideas. That is not addressed in the budget. While Deputy Cowen referred, at length, to the value of education, the pre-school area is where we have to make our play. His play only relates to a segment of third and fourth level education, which while being fundamentally important, does not deal with the issue of the beginning of the educational journey, in the pre-school and primary school sectors. It is in those two latter sectors that the fundamentals of learning are imparted.</P>
      <P>The roads programme was to be implemented by 2006. The toll road from Mullingar to Dublin <Col N="62"/>will be opened next Monday, nine months ahead of schedule. All of the tolls will be paid to the public private partnership company. The road west, which is one of the last roads to be developed is one of the first to be tolled. There is no toll on the road to Wexford, Waterford, Cork or Limerick. However, for those commuting from Mullingar everyday, for example, a husband and wife with different jobs, the new road will cost &euro;1,200 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is hitting the motorist again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be no road at all under Deputy Kenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>People will obviously pay for convenience but it is a very serious charge that is being levied against them. It is an issue that will arise repeatedly.</P>
      <P>The public-private partnership sector has been allocated several billion euro. It is very complex and costly to tender for the major road projects planned for the next 20 years under public-private partnership. If a contractor applies but is unsuccessful, he is unlikely to want to tender again because of the cost. This means a small cartel of companies with the capacity and money to tender for PPP projects will inevitably develop and prices will rise as a consequence. I suggest reviewing the PPP system to find some mechanism whereby those who tender unsuccessfully are not eliminated from future schemes so that competition remains in the system. Otherwise an inbuilt cartel will operate whereby the price of infrastructure, especially road infrastructure, will escalate.</P>
      <P>The metro to Dublin Airport was to be built by 2007. I understand the rockbreaker sank below the design level in the tunnel several times because the geological reports were inaccurate. Instead of going through rock it went through something much softer. I understand a substantial claim arises as a consequence. The financial position of Aer Lingus has not been addressed, although a report is due shortly.</P>
      <P>We have not seen the end of the accident and emergency debacle. The trolley watch shows today there are 375 beds in hospital corridors. Hospital beds were to be increased by 650 at the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>A number of tax incentives have been closed off, which was due to happen anyway, meaning that investors will now be encouraged to get into the private medical area, meaning that health becomes a commercial commodity instead of a public service. There should be an analysis of the cost of a bed in a public hospital delivered through the normal system compared with one in the 20% of beds to be delivered in the private sector.</P>
      <P>The decentralisation programme has become a complete and utter shambles. I have supported <Col N="63"/>the decentralisation programme for many years. Many towns in provincial Ireland are to be beneficiaries of the programme but not in the way it is being carried out. How does the Government account for the situation where the Equality Authority, which addressed the Fine Gael parliamentary party recently, states that of its 53 members, none had applied for transfer to Roscrea? This is replicated in a number of areas throughout the country. If it continues, it will destroy the public service by forcing people into new positions for which they are not trained and will break the long memory connection of the public service. People will end up doing nothing in other Departments where they did not want to move in the first place.</P>
      <P>The headage section in Michael Davitt House in Castlebar ran out of work because the scheme ended. The employees were offered jobs in the PULSE section of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on three eight-hour shifts, which is unsuitable for young married women with children among others, or a relocation to Portlaoise. Those who still do not want to go will be moved out of their offices in the next few days into empty accommodation to persuade them to accept the offer.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, appears to have doctored, at public expense and in his own interests, the results of a radio poll in the midlands which resulted in findings that 94% of listeners said decentralisation as it was progressing was a great thing. It is a shambles and I am not sure how the Government proposes to address it. The Minister for Finance does not use the same terms in the Budget Statement as the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, who said he would move 10,000 civil servants in a voluntary capacity within three years. That wording has disappeared into the ether. When people knock on houses in Dublin, they find that many civil servants have no intention of moving and the Minister responsible must provide an explanation. Many Departments where people do not want to move will not move. It will either destroy the public service or Departments will have to train people for jobs they have no experience of, thus damaging the quality of the public service.</P>
      <P>The Travers report pointed out that reform of the public service is inadequate and that spending money will not bring results without fundamental change. The next election will be very important and will have great consequences for this country. How a nation manages good fortune and success and the problems associated with it is as important as how it manages in adversity. Can we work with our wealth in such times?</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael and Labour parties will see to it that our prosperity is maintained and, with a new vision for Government, a new sense of responsibility and a strong spirit of community, we will build an Ireland that fulfils its promise. The vital Irish centre is alive and well. We will use a strong <Col N="64"/>economy to make our streets safer and our hospitals better. Our strategy will meet Ireland&rsquo;s challenges and protect Irish values. There has been a big splash and much spin and propaganda about yesterday&rsquo;s budget, delivered from the biggest war chest there has ever been. This war chest exists not because of Ministers such as Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, Deputy Martin or Deputy Cullen, but because of the work of the people.</P>
      <P>Everything that is wrong with this Government is epitomised by today&rsquo;s unfortunate demise of the former Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely. There has been a litany of such episodes in the past nine years to illustrate what is wrong at the heart of this Government. When people get their chance, they will cast their verdict and throw it out of power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny in regretting that the debate on the budget was delayed by the efforts of the House to have the issues surrounding the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To block a budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not see it that way. We did not block the debate but the Taoiseach blocked Deputy Callely from speaking. He was blocked and silenced and that is an important issue. Adversarial politics aside, nobody on this side of the House takes any pleasure from the resignation of an office holder. In this case it is clear the Minister of State resisted resignation because he felt he took the rap on the nursing home charges issue and covered it up for the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is more rubbish. I hope the Deputy has something more constructive to say on the budget than this nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister was fully aware of the nursing homes issue and was quite prepared to clock up another hundred million euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money without acting. When Mr. Pat McLoughlin&rsquo;s legal advice was brought to his attention, he had no argument after that. He should have known about the issue from the extension of the medical card to the over-70s but could not have failed to realise it from Mr. McLoughlin&rsquo;s advice, and no amount of retired civil servants&rsquo; control of the English language could cover up the fact that responsibility lay with the Minister, but the Minister of State took the rap. The Taoiseach is sensitive about it because the Minister of State said he told the Taoiseach at a division in the House.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the budget of a Government that has lost any sense of purpose other than hoping that it can buy people&rsquo;s votes at the next election with their own money. It lacks vision for the future and seeks to see how available money can <Col N="65"/>be scattered around to avoid heavy defeat at the polls in the next general election.</P>
      <P>For most of its eight years in power, the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government unapologetically transferred income to the better-off in society but now we are asked to believe it has discovered society and community and that Professor Putnam and Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy have become the favoured reading of the Cabinet. During the McCreevy years, it saw tax reduction as the only form of economic policy. Then, when its luck ran out and when its false promises were found out, it sent Mr. McCreevy to Brussels and promised that all was changed, changed utterly.</P>
      <P>This budget shows that the supposed Pauline conversion on the road to Inchydoney was not so much a firm purpose of amendment as a firm aversion to purpose. This is not the budget of a Minister who wants to steer this country in the direction of future prosperity or a fair society, but of a Minister running around from one issue to the next, like a demented fireman in a burning forest, putting out electoral fires and dampening down hotspots of voter discontent.</P>
      <P>This budget is little more than a series of attempts to address issues which have been preoccupying and aggravating voters: child care, transport, the standard rate tax band and tax avoidance by the super-wealthy. On each of these the Minister has sought to address, or to be seen to address, public concerns. In each case, he has done the bare minimum required, in his mind, to mute public anger. Many of his solutions are purely illusory. When in doubt, devise a five-year plan and forget to mention that the election is but 18 months away.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party should be flattered by our ability to provoke a Government response when we raise an issue. We raised the issue of child care, millionaires who pay no tax, the heating allowance and the stealth tax imposed by not indexing the standard rate band. In these and other cases, we got a response &mdash; inadequate, but a response.</P>
      <P>In several cases, there are now elaborate plans and strategies. There is to be a five-year plan for child care, just like in 2001 when there was to be a three-year plan for child care. The first two phases of that plan were implemented and then came the election, and the third phase was simply forgotten.</P>
      <P>We have a ten-year plan for transport, just like in 2001 when we were offered a ten-year health strategy, with hundreds of hospital beds right away and thousands more to follow. The transport plan comes with money attached &mdash; just look at the capital envelopes. The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto, however, had a multi-annual plan to provide billions in additional funding for the health strategy. The Minister for Finance said health would be the first priority, come what may, but as soon as the election was over, the strategy was scrapped, the funding was not provided and a plan to privatise the health service has been <Col N="66"/>introduced instead, or more correctly, a plan to create a parallel private health service has been introduced.</P>
      <P>Pouring ointment on electoral sore points may seem like good politics but it is not a recipe for good government. That is not the way to chart a course to future prosperity or fairness, towards a society that has a place for every child, that offers a better life to those who get up at 6.30 a.m. to go to work and that offers a warm and secure retirement to the elderly. It does not add up to a vision for how we can lay the foundations of future prosperity and ensure more and better jobs in the future. It will certainly not arrest the race to the bottom in employment standards that the Taoiseach is so concerned about but is so unwilling to address. There is, frankly, no prospect of the Government ever adopting such a sense of purpose and vision. It is tired, jaded, bereft of ideas and reduced to responding to public anger in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
      <P>We can say what we like about Mr. McCreevy &mdash; most of us in this House have &mdash; but Charlie McCreevy had an agenda. That agenda was changing the tax code and change it he did. It cannot be doubted that he left a very different tax code from the one he inherited. The millionaires who pay no tax are in no doubt as to what he achieved.</P>
      <P>The agenda now is different, it is the one McCreevy neglected &mdash; reforming public spending and public services. While it is important to reverse some of the most regressive of Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s tax breaks, the clear focus of the next Minister for Finance must be on public expenditure management and reform. We need to focus on the development and delivery of high quality public services with value for money for the taxpayer in the interests of society and the economy.</P>
      <P>Tackling that agenda means a major shift in the approach of the Minister for Finance and his Department. The Department of Finance must return to the kind of reforming, innovative and developmental role that it once adopted, most notably in the 1960s. The Department has not functioned in that way for some time. Rather, its role has been reduced to being the keeper of the purse, constantly seeking to minimise expenditure in the short term, rather than taking a longer-term view. It certainly does not act as an engine of economic and social development. This is not a new problem. In his autobiography, for example, Garret FitzGerald wrote: &ldquo;I had been concerned to observe how far the Department of Finance had moved from the innovative and developmental role it had played under T. K. Whitaker&rsquo;s leadership in the late 1950s and 1960s&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Every organisation needs a treasurer, a keeper of the purse who contains the urge to spend. No organisation, whether it be a local sports club or the Government of a country, can be without such control. We must maintain strict discipline over our public finances. For the Department of <Col N="67"/>Finance and its Minister, however, that is not enough. It also needs to use its role in the monitoring and control of public expenditure in a proactive manner. This developmental function is a central element in the role of a modern treasury. It is also one which was legally assigned to the Minister for Finance in 1980, when the Department of Economic Planning and Development was abolished.</P>
      <P>The functions transferred to the Minister for Finance at this time are worth reciting: to promote and co-ordinate economic and social planning for the development of the economy both generally and as respects different sectors and different regions of the country, to identify the policies it considers necessary for general economic and social development and to report to the Government, to identify in consultation with Departments of State and to review and appraise the plans and activities of Departments giving effect to the policies for general economic and social development adopted by the Government, to make proposals to the Government for the co-ordination of those plans and activities and for their integration with national economic and social plans and to review the implementation of such national economic and social plans as may be approved of by the Government from time to time and to report to the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is simply not fulfilling this role. Instead we have a patchwork of different initiatives, regular failures of imagination and sheer unmitigated, unprecedented waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money. The Minister came in here yesterday and sought to portray the impression that he had a great plan for our economic future and our society. In the end, he simply addressed the usual budget concerns and provided money for what he calls fourth level education. What it amounts to is a fund for universities and it is not clear in what we have heard so far whether the institutes of technology are included. The Minister for Education and Science, always on hand to educate people inside this House and outside it, is nodding her head. If that means &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I welcome and accept her assurance, but the Minister for Finance did not say that yesterday. His statement was endorsed by an exhortation to efficiency. He said:</P>
      <P LI="1">This is a small country. It is not sensible to have our third level institutions pitched against each other across key disciplines. Instead what we need is the promotion of system-wide collaboration that can draw on the collective strengths of all of our third level institutions.</P>
      <P FLI="0">He wants universities to co-operate in using this money. How is this to be achieved? If fourth level education is so important, and it is, does it not deserve an institutional innovation? Is there not a case for a new university structure at national level, which would act towards the existing third level institutions in the way that, for example, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge act <Col N="68"/>towards their constituent colleges? Might not such a new fourth level institution be able to co-ordinate the combined talents of our universities to attract the highest calibre of researchers from abroad, ensuring that they had the best possible facilities, while also arranging links to the individual colleges?</P>
      <P>For all the high-minded talk, there is no joined-up or coherent strategy on how we are to address the challenges and fragilities facing the Irish economy or to build a stronger society. What is the plan for how we are to move up the value chain and create more and better jobs? How will we preserve living standards in the economy rather than indulge in a race to the bottom? How can we deal with an over-bloated construction sector which accounts for one in eight jobs and where a correction, which will inevitably happen, will have significant consequences for our economy? What is the Minister&rsquo;s view of the performance of the export sector? Does he have any thoughts on how SSIAs will affect inflation, let alone any strategy for dealing with it? Is he even aware of the disaster that is the Government&rsquo;s broadband policy and its implications for our economy?</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on the Minister for Finance to develop a strategic vision for the future of our economy and our society and to structure public spending to these ends. However, the Government does not have that vision. The national development plan is a central case in point, launched with fanfare and spin and then allowed to run rapidly into the sand. From the beginning, the NDP had no departmental or ministerial champion. Each Department was responsible for its own bailiwick, no joined-up thinking, no Minister anxious to leave an imprint behind him or her and no single Minister responsible for implementing the national development plan. The next national development plan, about which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, spoke yesterday, will follow exactly the same pattern unless the next Minister for Finance drives its implementation.</P>
      <P>As the litany of wasteful and foolish expenditures of the Government is well known, there is no need for me to repeat it. It comes with a very real cost attached. Every euro wasted by the Government is a euro not spent on health, new teachers, supporting families and tackling crime or anti-social behaviour. Not only is waste socially injurious, but it represents a drain on our economy and a threat to our current and future competitiveness. Where public services and productive infrastructure are provided at a cost, which is greatly in excess of the cost of similar provision in other countries, Ireland is at a corresponding competitive disadvantage.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The absence of a visionary approach to development is evident elsewhere as well. Last year, the enterprise strategy group, established by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, published a report, Ahead of the Curve, which attempted to chart out a future for Irish enterprise policy. It was an <Col N="69"/>attempt to put flesh on the idea of moving up the value chain. One of its conclusions was that a precondition for economic success is what it described as effective and agile government. What was so striking was the statement in the report which reads as follows: &ldquo;The Irish public system proved itself capable of such responsiveness in the past, but many believe that Ireland has lost its former ability to respond quickly and flexibly to identified needs and there is no longer a clear focus on enterprise as a key economic driver&rdquo;. That is not the Labour Party speaking but the enterprise strategy group, established by the Minister, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>There can be no more damning indictment of this, the so-called pro-enterprise Government. As I meet people throughout the country, I am increasingly struck by the shared sense of a Government that is anything but effective and agile. This must change. If we are to bridge the gap between economic success and social failings, and if we are to lay the foundations for future economic prosperity, we must reinvent the way the Government does its business, starting with the way it spends our money.</P>
      <P>I see little in the Minister&rsquo;s speech yesterday on parliamentary oversight of public spending and public expenditure decision-making. There is a paragraph about it in the report. However, it appears to pay lip service to a report I prepared at the request of the Committee of Public Accounts, which it endorsed subsequently and sent to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance for comment before publishing it. In the report, we addressed the entire question of public expenditure decision-making and the parliamentary oversight that is currently absent. The Committee of Public Accounts does not address that issue. It gets regular requests for intervention in current public projects, but that is not the role of the Committee of Public Accounts. The role of the committee is to examine the spending <i>post hoc.</i></P>
      <P>The weakness in the system is in the preparation of the Estimates, the manner in which it is done, the manner in which it is inaccessible and impenetrable and the manner in which it is approved after a half year&rsquo;s spending or more is over. We made specific recommendations in terms of the Estimates process, the bilateral meetings that go on between Ministers, the timing of it and collapsing the Estimates publication and the budget into a single event. When questioned in the House on the matter, the Minister appeared to effect his usual dismissive approach that if a proposal did not come from him or the Department, it apparently has no merit. While he paid lip service to it yesterday, it is far from clear that it means a significant change in the way we do things. I mean no disrespect to the Department of Finance officials, for whom I have great respect, but by any international comparison, parliamentary oversight of the Estimates process is inadequate.</P><Col N="70"/>
      <P Just="Left">There is a table at the back of the report I drew up relating to the Estimates debates for the 15 Departments this year. It shows that, for example, &euro;11 billion spent on health attracted an hour and a half&rsquo;s discussion in committee. The select committee system is not working in that sense. I put forward the proposition that the finance committee should have this responsibility and should be resourced to do the job properly. I am aware it would mean more accountability for the Government and the senior officials in the Department of Finance, but that is a price we must pay in modern governance. Merely because all wisdom was reposited with Government, the Executive and the permanent government in the past does not mean that is good enough for the future.</P>
      <P>There was no shortage yesterday of money to be spent, but there was a shortage of ideas, imagination and vision. Let us look at the child care package as an example. For months families have been promised that the Government would address the child care problem. As my colleague Deputy Burton stated yesterday, our children are not the problem, and nurturing children is one of the central functions of any human society. The Government seems to have forgotten that and for years it has done little to address the child care issue. When it got a bloody nose at the by-elections, as Deputy Kenny said, it decided child care would be addressed and we were all assured it would be the main priority. A sum of &euro;19.23 per week is the full measure of that priority. After all the hype, the amount to be delivered will be less than &euro;20 per week, in a country where the average cost of full-time cr&egrave;che care is nearly &euro;170 per week. It is commonplace to pay &euro;200 per week for the care of a young child, all from post-tax income.</P>
      <P>The provisions will do nothing for school-going children. Do they not merit consideration? The Minister has opened a new division, not between mothers or spouses who opt out of the workforce for a short period to care for their children and those with children who remain in employment, but between families with children under six and families with children over six. Apparently parents in the latter category do not deserve help with child care costs.</P>
      <P>The other significant item of news is that there is to be an extension of maternity leave. I welcome such a proposal. The Labour Party published its proposals in this regard. However, in spite of the extension, half of the additional maternity leave will be unpaid. According to the <i>Irish Examiner</i> child care poll, 57% of mothers do not avail of unpaid leave and only 22% avail of more than four of the eight weeks to which they are entitled at present. In stark and simple terms, unpaid leave does not pay the mortgage.</P>
      <P>We are not prepared to make employers contribute in respect of child care. Employers demand European-level participation rates of women in the workforce, yet we seem to be afraid to statutorily underpin career breaks, maternity <Col N="71"/>leave and part-time work. The Government has been very generous to employers over almost nine years. There are a number of examples even in this budget. We had a very interesting discussion last night on the financial resolutions pertaining to tax remittances. The closing off of the loophole in this regard by financial resolution is calculated to save the State &euro;100 million in lost income tax. We have been very generous in allowing people who earn more income than the rest of us to invest it in tax-efficient schemes to generate more wealth for themselves, yet we seem to be fearful of requiring employers to make their contribution to the critical issue of child care.</P>
      <P>It is particularly disappointing that the budget does not address the issue of universal pre-school education. Universal pre-school education is a central plank in the Labour Party&rsquo;s child care policy, and for good reason. The social, economic and developmental advantages of pre-school education are enormous and it is now regarded internationally as a vital element in any serious attack on poverty and disadvantage. In a world where people will increasingly trade not on who they know but on what they know, the combined nurturing of children by family and society is the key to the future well-being of individuals and countries. The Government does not seem to believe our children are worthy of that investment.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about taxation. For some time, the Labour Party has been arguing that the main issue regarding taxation is one of fairness. Given the prosperity of our economy, there is no pressing requirement for increases in taxation. There are, however, deep structural inequalities in our tax code. The Government has presided over the accumulation of tax reliefs and incentives that have allowed the very wealthy in our society to pay little or no tax. Such was the anger provoked among the public that the Minister felt obliged to be seen to change the circumstances that obtained. However, it is by no means clear that he has done so. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I propose now to place an annual overall cap on the extent to which specific incentive reliefs can be availed of. The cap will apply to those with income over &euro;250,000 per year. It will operate by reducing by half the amount of income that can be relieved from tax by certain specified tax reliefs. This measure will help eliminate the phenomenon of tax free millionaires and increase the effective rate of tax on those with high income towards a minimum of 20%.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Will the cap really eliminate the phenomenon of tax free millionaires and, if so, how? Unless one introduces a minimum effective tax rate whereby high earners, irrespective of the extent to which they avail of tax reliefs, are subject to a minimum tax liability, it surely remains the case that a person can continue to accumulate reliefs until he <Col N="72"/>or she pays no tax. My party proposes that the minimum liability be 20%.</P>
      <P>I do not know what &ldquo;towards a minimum of 20%&rdquo; means, nor do I know what is implied by &ldquo;certain specified tax reliefs&rdquo;. Does it mean, for example, that one can no longer avail of the relief applicable to investment in car parks but that one can avail of it if investing in the private medical facilities on public campuses proposed by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney? None of this is spelled out and I envisage many accountants generating income that they might invest in car parks at the end of the process. The Department has again excelled itself in constructing a form of English than is entirely inaccessible and impenetrable in respect of matters about which it does not want us to know.</P>
      <P>I do not understand how the system will work. Each individual relief may be capped but there will be no limit on the adding up of reliefs. I do not understand how this can be claimed to be a minimum effective rate of tax. If it were, the Minister would say so, rather than use carefully judged language about increasing the effective rate of tax &ldquo;towards&rdquo; a minimum of 20%. The people who get up at 6.30 a.m. do not have tax rates &ldquo;towards&rdquo; 42%, they just pay 42%. They also pay PRSI and levies and, as Deputy Kenny stated, they are now expected to pay tolls to come to work. They make these payments from modest incomes, which are substantially more modest as a result of the non-indexation of bands since the general election. They do not pay rates of tax &ldquo;towards&rdquo; any given percentage, they just pay, and so should the millionaires. It is clear from the Minister&rsquo;s budget that the millionaires will not do so. A whole new class of no-tax millionaires will be created through investment in private hospitals. They will be provided with land on the sites of public hospitals and with generous tax breaks. They will cherry-pick what is profitable to provide in the health service and leave the expensive and the difficult to the public sector. In the process they will drive up costs, drive up insurance bills and cause a migration of skilled labour from the public health service to these private institutions.</P>
      <P>All this, we are told, arose from an accidental meeting between Mr. McCreevy and a constituent in Naas. This person just happened to suggest including a special section in the Finance Bill for those who wanted to build private hospitals. That was done and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is building on that, thus aggravating further the existing two-tier system.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Finance had a great deal of money to give away yesterday and he did that. He scattered it around every segment of the electorate from whom the harvest of votes might be improved. There is no innovation, no <Col N="73"/>new ideas and no joined-up thinking. The budget is cautious, predictable and safe. It is not intended to address structural inequality, rather it is designed for one purpose only: to schmooze sections of the electorate that have grown disaffected with the Government. Taxpayers get some of their own money back but they will forget the swindle wrought on them by the Government&rsquo;s calculated failure to index tax bands since the previous general election, which is the greatest stealth tax of all.</P>
      <P>I regret that the newspaper of record has got it wrong this morning. I acknowledge this is a major offence and I know the people on the Government benches are very happy with the newspaper of record these days, but nonetheless I wish to correct the record. It states that 23% of taxpayers will now pay at the top or marginal rate. I correct that by stating that 32% will pay at the top rate, not 23%. This is against the Government&rsquo;s pledge of 20%, which commitment was reiterated in Sustaining Progress when it said that 80% of taxpayers would pay at not more than the standard rate. The Government pledge was that 20% would pay tax at the top rate. However, following, rather than before, yesterday&rsquo;s budget, 32% of taxpayers pay at the top rate.</P>
      <P>This is the progress made on tax reform by the Ministers, Deputy McDowell and Deputy Harney, who never failed to blow their trumpets. It must irritate the daylights out of Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers but on and on the Ministers go about how they are responsible for the tax cutting strategy of this Government, with 20-42, 20-20 cashback and everybody is happy. As this House knows and as people outside this House know when they look at their disposable income, tax is a function of how quickly one comes into the initial tax band of 20% and thereafter how quickly one becomes liable to pay tax at 42%. Under this Government, people on the average industrial earnings become liable to pay tax at 42%, which is the point that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, should take on board.</P>
      <P>The child care lobby could not be ignored again, but is &euro;19.23 per child per week worth the candle? Do working parents of children over six years of age not deserve help with child care? When it comes to rolling out five-year strategies, has this Government any credibility left? The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, should be asked where the health strategy is now. I remind the House of Ballymascanlon. Where is the health strategy today? Where is the Minister, Deputy Martin, today? Where will he be next week after Ivor talks to the Sunday newspapers?</P>
      <P>Following years of lip-service to the closing of loopholes and shutting down of tax shelters, some tentative steps are evident, but on the Saint Augustine principle of &ldquo;not just yet&rdquo;. In the meantime, I suggest anyone thwarted from minimising their tax liabilities in car parks should consider switching to private hospitals as the <Col N="74"/>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, sets out to create a parallel private health service against the advice of even the chief executive of the Health Service Executive.</P>

      <P Just="Left">The meanest cut of all is that there is no reinstatement of the RAPID programme. I really regret that our friends and hard-working colleagues in the media do not address the RAPID experience. In 2001, a year before the general election, the then Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, a man whose words one would never question, launched the RAPID programme to fast-track moneys of &euro;1.9 billion to 25 areas of disadvantage. The sum of &euro;5 million was expended in recruiting consultants to devise the RAPID plans but when the general election was over, the rug was pulled from under it. The plans exist but they were never funded. Multiple disadvantage is concentrated in 25 areas of the country and the only contribution the Cabinet made was to add 25 more on the basis that if anything is going, we want one in our area too. The RAPID programme disappeared off the face of the earth.</P>
      <P>The dormant accounts money came out of the DIRT inquiry and was to be distributed for this kind of social and community purpose by ADM, but the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, introduced legislation to take it over when he discovered the sum of money was a great deal more than the House thought it would be. He is since going around the west dishing it out like lollipops. One cannot go into a pub in the west for a quiet drink without being informed that the Minister is upstairs at a meeting with some community group and giving them a few bob.</P>

	<P>Deputy Burton made the point yesterday that the people in the new poverty trap are those who are forced into private rented accommodation. Our social housing problem is now forced into private rented accommodation, which is accommodation driven by tax reliefs and tax incentives. Those people are on housing rental supplement but if they try to go back into <Col N="75"/>the workforce, either they lose that supplement or else it is greatly abated. This creates the new modern poverty trap. People who want to get out of that accommodation, into work and back to education are not being facilitated by this Government. This is one major defect in yesterday&rsquo;s budget which ought to be addressed in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>T&aacute;&aacute;thas orm deis a fh&aacute;il labhairt tar &eacute;is na c&aacute;infhaisn&eacute;ise mar t&aacute; go leor ann ar cheart d&uacute;inn a phl&eacute;. Tos&oacute;idh m&eacute; le r&aacute;iteas an Aire &eacute; f&eacute;in. The Minister spoke yesterday about economic sustainability and the quality of spending. If we are to develop an economy and a society on a sustainable basis, the Government must invest in alleviating poverty and in the development of indigenous renewable energy. Instead, the Government has decided to kick off its election campaign and has paved the way to send money out of our economy using a carbon fund. Let us imagine that the Minister for Finance stood up yesterday, telling us that he had a great scheme to advance the cause of road safety. Instead of providing resources for more road checks, random breath testing, more ambulances and so on, he would instead pay for the funerals of those that were going to die on the roads. That is the analogy which parallels the carbon fund. It is not a response to the growing problem of greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>It seems the Government is finally beginning to accept that the economy is facing a serious energy crisis in the medium term. Evidence of this has been available for years. The Government has reacted because of the impending election and the increase in oil prices we have experienced this year. It is also reacting to the worldwide evidence that climate change is kicking in. We do not have to go to New Orleans to see the effects of climate change. We only have to look at the frequency and intensity of rainfall. In the 1960s, 7% of rainfall was classed as heavy, but in the 1990s, 15% of rainfall was classed as heavy. It is no wonder that we have flooding problems and it is no wonder that the Taoiseach was famously pictured in his wellingtons in Drumcondra. It will not be the last time that such a scenario will occur.</P>
      <P>However, the excise relief on biofuels and capital grants announced yesterday still fail to acknowledge the massive potential in the renewables sector for creating employment, developing indigenous enterprise, creating markets for Irish agricultural produce and providing security of energy supply to this economy. The Govern<Col N="76"/>ment&rsquo;s measures are conservative, long overdue, and leave us lagging behind other countries. The potential of the renewables sector represents an enormous opportunity. The Government&rsquo;s biofuels target of 2% by 2008 is extremely conservative and even brazen, as it effectively states that we will break the EU requirement that the target be reached by 2005. Moreover, it seems to be an admission that we will not meet our EU target of 5.75% of biofuels for transport by 2010, just as we have missed the 2% target in 2005.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s announcement of &euro;65 million for a renewable energy grant scheme for the period 2006-10 is very small beer given the potential for saving energy in this way. With 75,000 new homes being built every year, an allocation of &euro;13 million per year only amounts to &euro;175 per house. That does not allow for any allocation to existing housing stock. This is not a serious commitment. In the UK, significant grants have been available to householders for such works for many years. We have to go further and I repeat my call for grants of between 30% and 50% for solar, geothermal and woodchip heating systems. There are grants available north of the Border for photovoltaic installation in public and private buildings. I was in a church that was able to derive an income from the energy being created by the photovoltaic cells on its roof. The Government&rsquo;s measures betray the consistent and regrettable lack of vision and ambition that seems to have prevailed in this policy area.</P>
      <P>The energy performance of buildings directive is legislation that has been questioned by many of us on this side of the House over several months. It will take effect across the EU on 4 January 2006. It is an elementary step in increasing energy efficiency and, amongst other things, will provide house buyers and tenants with information on their potential home. However, it will not come into force in Ireland, because this Government has arranged a three-year derogation. This derogation is ostensibly a result of the Government&rsquo;s lack of technical ability to implement the directive. However, that is an attempt to protect friends who will fund the respective election campaigns of the Government parties. If that is the case, then I compliment the Government on its consistency. This &ldquo;friends first&rdquo; approach to policy is consistent with the effective extension of many of the property and area-based tax reliefs, as well as the stallion relief which is being retained until after the next election. The Government&rsquo;s corporate backers will smile this Christmas.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, I warn the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that he has no right to complain about the EU&rsquo;s assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s environmental record if this represents the approach he is taking. The carbon fund is essentially a mechanism put in place so that the Government can avoid its international obligations under the Kyoto protocol and send hundreds of millions of euro out of our economy <Col N="77"/>between 2008 and 2012. A carbon levy, laid out in our national climate change strategy and supported by the Combat Poverty Agency, the EPA and senior advisers in the ESRI, would keep the money in the Irish economy. In turn, the money should be used to reduce PRSI for employees and employers, reduce VAT and increase social welfare payments. The carbon fund is consistent with the Government&rsquo;s approach to this issue. It is happy to have the taxpayer pay for the effects of its failures rather than addressing the causes. As I mentioned earlier, this is like paying for the patient&rsquo;s funeral rather than paying for the treatment.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance waxed lyrical about the quality of spending. I will not try to point out the contradictions between this philosophy and between the Government&rsquo;s practice in transport, health and energy, as they are too obvious to require comment. However, I will ask a question. Has the Minister applied this philosophy of quality spending to tax expenditure? Although he has undertaken some piecemeal reform of the system of tax relief in this budget, he has not put in place a transparent and rational system whereby he will be in a position to answer the following questions this time next year on tax expenditure. What is the social, economic or environmental purpose of the tax relief? How many people and which incomes are benefitting from the relief? What benefits are accruing to Irish society from the relief? How much tax is being foregone? Are these costs justified? These are the questions that come about from a cost benefit analysis, which we are entitled to have. Lobbying for tax reliefs will continue in the infamous tent at the Galway races. The Government&rsquo;s decision on tax reliefs will continue to be led by its &ldquo;friends first&rdquo; philosophy. The quality of expenditure comes a distant second.</P>
      <P>In 2003, we were given a decentralisation budget. Decentralisation is now a mess. In 2004, we were given a disability budget. In the meantime, the Government has forced through a deeply flawed disability Act. Now that the Act is in force, there was no mention of disability in this year&rsquo;s budget speech. That is somewhat surprising, given that the Irish Wheelchair Association and others have been lobbying hard for core funding to mainstream many of the services provided by community employment schemes. It would have cost about &euro;11.5 million to provide that core funding. It would have been well within the tax take of &euro;100 million from VAT on increased fuel charges and would also have paid for a doubling of the fuel allowance. While a great deal of money was spent, it was nothing like as much as was taken in. It was a mean gesture by the Government.</P>
      <P>We have been disappointed again by the provisions for children and carers, which is something which will rebound on the Government when election time comes. While I acknowledge that the Government has at least modified its nar<Col N="78"/>row, child benefit based approach to children, it is failing to target those in need. It has failed on a number of fronts. Barnardos and other groups have rightly pointed out that in the context of current child care costs, the under-sixes payment is a drop in the ocean. Budget measures do little for stay at home parents and fail utterly to deal with the need for a free year of pre-school places. Most significant, perhaps, is that they fail to deliver on a policy of ending child poverty.</P>
      <P>The Government must be reminded of some basic facts. It has failed once again to target poverty despite the recommendations of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Barnardos and, it seems, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. Since taking office at the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan has paid constant lip service to the concept of ending child poverty, but the budget makes his talk seem hollow. It must be embarrassing for the Minister who must ask how he will face those to whom he has promised targeted, anti-poverty payments. Wealthy parents will receive the same payments as those living in poverty which is money which could have been targeted more effectively if the Government was serious. In this respect, I am obliged to mention the three words &ldquo;child dependant allowance&rdquo; which the Government has tried to ignore for the past eight years. The allowance has fallen by one third in real terms in three years despite the fact that it is supposed to be the mechanism to target child poverty. Why has the Government failed on this front?</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned the formative period during which Dr. Ken Whitaker strongly advised in the Department of Finance a radical shift in the economic paradigm of the late 1950s. In 2005 we face a very significant crossroads which is signalled internationally by the rising cost of energy. Unless Ireland embraces the zero-emissions unit of wealth, we will find that our country will slip further and further behind in its competitiveness. In the North I see small scale grid connections and hear from Denmark of targets of 50% wind energy generation by 2030 while we continue to be so oil dependent in the Republic that we make the United States of America look good. Ireland is the seventh most oil dependent nation in the world while the United States of America is ninth. Talk of economic competitiveness and wealth creation is hollow as long as the Government promotes a gluttonous, energy hungry country. We must make the paradigm shift necessary to build a lean, green and fair society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>The budget was not an especially bad one as budgets go and I welcomed it to the extent that it went. To a great extent it involved putting a brave face on things after years of neglect and there are glaring omissions from it, especially in the areas of housing and health. The Government is not driven by a vision of a better Ireland. While it tells us we enjoy an enhanced <Col N="79"/>quality of life, it neglects to tell us that the State is more unequal than ever before. Some Ministers, especially Deputy McDowell who is present in the Chamber, believe inequality in society is a useful and good thing, but the sentiment is not shared on this side of the House, certainly not by any Member who is here. While the Government tells us that more of our citizens are in work than at any time in our history, it fails to say we are working longer hours. The eight-hour day is an illusion to those on average incomes who are trying to meet excessive mortgage payments. The Government says we are welcoming and providing for more and more people who are coming to our shores, but it does not tell us that we allow migrant workers to be exploited and bar them from accessing social protections during their first two years in the State despite the fact that they pay taxes and contribute to the economy. The Government tells us more people enjoy a decent quality of life than ever before, but its members should try telling that to the families languishing on social housing waiting lists, elderly patients spending days on trolleys and chairs in hospital corridors and commuting parents, many of whom spend more than four hours a day in traffic, who drop their toddlers in cr&egrave;ches at daybreak and do not see them again until nightfall.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister, the budget is largely about two key objectives which are the facilitation of sustained economic growth and improved equality and opportunity for all in society. In truth, the budget is about economic growth and the winning of an election. The 48,413 families on social housing waiting lists will be dumbfounded by the fact that the Government has failed to make provision for their urgent needs in a budget which amounts to a slap in their faces. Expenditure on local authority and social housing programmes will increase by a mere<?oasys _jy?>5%, which figure fails even to keep pace with the annual increase in the cost of building houses and purchasing land. Development cost increases run currently at 10%. What hope can people waiting on social housing lists have for the future in that context? Sinn F&eacute;in has asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for 12 months whether the Government will accept the NESC recommendation of an increase of 73,000 permanent social housing units between 2005 and 2012. There is no target for the elimination of housing waiting lists nor is there a commitment to deliver the number of social housing units needed.</P>
      <P>Given that housing is a basic human requirement, it is difficult to comprehend how the Government can so blatantly ignore the plight of so many in desperate need of it. I have asked myself why there is so little on housing in the budget and how the Government can ignore the plight of some of the most vulnerable in society. I can only conclude that Fianna F&aacute;il, whose policies are decided by focus groups and aimed solely <Col N="80"/>at winning votes, does not include people with social housing needs in its calculations. The crux of the problem is that where Government policies are calculated merely to win votes, the most vulnerable lose out. The Government has written off that section of society which has serious housing needs and has probably made the calculation that those in hostels for the homeless and other emergency accommodation do not vote. Their needs, therefore, will not affect an election outcome. I congratulate the homeless community which has organised itself in the group Street Scene and done a great deal to bring media attention to the ongoing issue of homelessness. This agitation must continue in light of the Government turning a blind eye to their plight.</P>
      <P>Groups working with the homeless have expressed their disappointment at the failure of the budget to deliver on housing. The Simon communities have expressed their disappointment that there has been no progress on three actions which would have made a serious impact on homelessness. There could have been an increase in social housing expenditure, an increase in the caps on capital assistance scheme housing and the introduction of a revenue stream to supply formerly homeless people in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Parental care for children must be a key element of the child care strategy. We must work to enable parents where it is their preference to care for their children in the early years of their lives. Measures in this area would be of long-term benefit to society. I was deeply disappointed that the Minister for Finance chose not to bring forward proposals on paternity leave. The position of this State on paternity leave is shameful. It is incredible that in this day and age there is no legal entitlement to paternity leave, paid or unpaid &mdash; not one day for a new father. It is archaic. This State ranks bottom of the list in terms of paternity leave. Most countries in the EU offer paid paternity leave, from two days in Spain to two weeks in France, while in Norway new fathers are entitled to a full four weeks. Fathers north of the Border are entitled to two weeks&rsquo; paternity leave, yet in this State there is no entitlement. We need an explanation why nothing was included in the budget in respect of paternity leave.</P>
      <P>The other shocking omission was the introduction of pay in respect of parental leave. This Government has not, evidently, grasped the extent to which paid parental leave may be used to alleviate the child care crisis. According to the MORI-MOC survey carried out as part of the review by the maternity leave working group established in 2001, almost 7% of the labour force was eligible for parental leave in that year. Only 20% of those eligible were estimated to have taken up the leave. This is very low and should be of concern to the Government. If it were genuinely committed to parental leave and believed in its benefits for children and parents, it would <Col N="81"/>promote it and seek to encourage maximum take-up.</P>
      <P>Payment in respect of parental leave would have made a real difference and progressed significantly the goal of enabling children to be cared for by their parents during the early years of their lives. It would have alleviated pressure for child care places and would have been of enormous help to parents who otherwise would have to put small infants into child care. This is most expensive in the case of children under 12 months who need a higher level of attention. The take-up rate of parental leave in this State is very low. We need to move progressively towards a situation where it is possible for a child to be cared for by one of its parents at home up to the age of three.</P>
      <P>I want to touch on a number of other issues such as why the Government did not get rid of tax breaks for private hospitals. In effect, taxpayers will continue to subsidise private health care. A perfect example is an application for a private hospital near Dundalk in my constituency which was dealt with by the local authority. Effectively, the taxpayer would have funded the capital cost of the provision of a private hospital, equivalent to 15% in each of the six years, with 10% in the final year. We are told the taxpayer is offered services by the private hospital sector in return for such generosity on the part of the Government. That is so, but at what price?</P>
      <P>To take one example, the cost of public renal dialysis for patients attending at the Beacon Clinic is &euro;68,000 per year per patient. That is the private sector. Just across the Border, at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, public sector patients, who are there because of the lack of capacity in this State, can be catered for at a cost of &euro;49,000 per patient per year, 41% less expensive than the private sector. How is this good value for taxpayers&rsquo; money? How is the Government being responsible or caring of the health of the people of this State? Surely this is a perfect example of how the Government, as with the housing situation, should develop our public services and provide the necessary level of service for people while preventing the rip-off in the private sector. The Minister should address this issue in his reply.</P>
      <P>Another example is the fact that the employee PRSI ceiling is regressive and my party seeks its abolition. This view has been supported by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which stated in 2002:</P>
      <P LI="1">Abolition of the ceiling would make the employee PRSI system more progressive. The current system is regressive in that those over the ceiling pay a smaller proportion of gross income in PRSI than those earning under the ceiling. Both receive the same benefits. Abolition of the ceiling would, therefore, strengthen the social solidarity element of the system in <Col N="82"/>that a proportion of all income would be pooled for the benefit of all contributors.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In a submission to the tax strategy group on 28 September 2004 in respect of PRSI issues, the Department of Social and Family Affairs stated that the abolition of the employee ceiling would, &ldquo;address the criticism that the employee contribution system is regressive because those over the ceiling pay a smaller proportion of gross income in PRSI than those under the ceiling&rdquo;. My party calls for revenue raised for the social insurance fund from this proposed abolition to be used for the introduction of pay in respect of parental leave. There are many other issues which I would like to deal with but, unfortunately, time is against us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The hype, r&iacute;-r&aacute; agus ruaille buaille that traditionally accompanies the Budget Statement and budget day badly needs to be decommissioned. It is a smokescreen which diverts attention very effectively from the following reality. As far as the economy and the lives of working people and working class families are concerned, when it comes to economic reality, the budget and its measures are a sideshow. The economic structures that dominate our society and the economic policies pursued by this Government, based on the fundamentals of neo-liberalist capitalism, dictate how people live, their living standards, their struggle to survive and how difficult it is to make ends meet. Around budget time the millionare-owned media &mdash; even the billionaire-owned media in a few cases &mdash; and the political parties in Government all collude to obfuscate this reality, namely, the mortgages people must pay, the cost of living and the stealth taxes that continue in one form or other. These are the issues that determine how people can live economically. In this regard the budget truly reflects some relatively minor adjustments.</P>
      <P>To illustrate, in the budget a single worker on &euro;30,000 or about the average industrial wage will gain in changes in the PAYE income tax, according to the Budget Statement, &euro;402 in a full year. Take the example of a single worker who lives in Tyrellstown, a major new suburb of 2,000 homes or so in west Dublin. The single worker moved and purchased a home there, say, two years ago. However, the privatisation of public services such as the maintenance of open spaces, public liability insurance and lighting through the mechanism of the management companies foisted upon people such as this by the local authority, acting in place of the Government, means he or she must pay a management fee of, say, &euro;400 a year. The money arising from the PAYE tax break envisaged yesterday will be spent before it appears in their pay packets. However, the Minister for Finance does not have to mention that in the House. It is one of the many dishonest stealth taxes placed on the shoulders of ordinary working people.</P><Col N="83"/>
      <P>Up to three years ago in parts of north and west Dublin under the remit of Fingal County Council, refuse collection from households was met from the general taxation of working people. Every time a bin is emptied in Fingal, it costs &euro;7.50, which amounts to &euro;390 a year should a family have to put out a bin on a weekly basis. This is the same amount allegedly gained by a single worker earning &euro;30,000 per annum in the budget. A second stealth tax, therefore, has been placed on the shoulders of working people, which the Minister does not have to mention and which he ignores conveniently.</P>
      <P>The changes to child care and child benefit were announced with a great fanfare. The Budget Statement referred to an example of a married couple with a gross income of &euro;40,000 per annum and two children under the age of six. The increases in the personal tax credit, child benefit and the child supplement are worth &euro;2,323 in 2006, as it only covers nine months. However, this couple purchased a semi-detached three-bedroom house three years ago for &euro;260,000. Ten years ago the home would have cost &euro;60,000. The mortgage payments hanging around their necks reflect that grotesque increase in house prices. During that time, speculators and developers were allowed by the Government to run riot with the price of building land and homes, one of the most fundamental human needs. The increase in the price of a home, which that typical family is forced to pay, means the &euro;2,323 gained in tax breaks and child benefit pales into insignificance by contrast with the outright robbery of mortgage payments resulting from the increase in house prices.</P>
      <P>The records of the Central Statistics Office indicate that three years ago an average family home cost &euro;262,000 in Dublin. Incredibly, within three years, the average price had jumped &euro;100,000 with mortgage payments increasing accordingly. The average mortgage payment for a regular family home costing &euro;300,000 is &euro;1,437 per month whereas three years ago, the house would have cost &euro;80,000 less and the family would have paid &euro;400 less per month on its mortgage. A family purchasing a home this year will pay &euro;4,800 per annum more on its mortgage than three years ago, yet the Minister and the Government expects us to be grateful for the provision of &euro;2,300 in child care allowances.</P>
      <P>The increases granted in the budget, which are generated by the hard earned taxes of the PAYE and self-employed workers, are absorbed by the profiteering and speculation the Government parties have allowed land owners, developers and big business to run rampant with since they first came to power. These factors influence the lives of working people 1,000 times more than the adjustments made on budget day, yet the print media provide acres of detailed coverage about the winners and losers today while these fundamental realities are not mentioned. The lives of <Col N="84"/>working people are much more intense and difficulty nowadays as they try to make ends meet, than they were ten years ago as a result of the Government&rsquo;s policy of allowing speculators and private capitalists to run riot while workers pick up the tab. One can only expect this from the millionaires and billionaires who own the newspapers and who are part of the establishment.</P>
      <P>The banks are another bastion of society, which have gained massively from the significant increases in house prices that are such a burden on working people. They have made profits hand over fist at the expense of young single workers and couples who will pay 30 and 40 year mortgages for virtually the rest of their days, yet the Government decided to abolish levies that would have taken a modest &euro;100 million from these super profitable institutions. The Government decided to do nothing about the speculators and to leave them at it. This time last year, I exposed in the House the purchase of 11 acres of building land in south Dublin five years ago for &euro;32 million and its resale in 2004 for &euro;85 million, a speculative profit of &euro;53 million in only four years. The speculators were not from outer space; they were the so-called cream of the establishment. Wealthy legal, business and medical personnel organised this entirely legal speculative scam. However, the apartments on that land will cost on average &euro;200,000 in site costs alone before a brick is laid. In other words, the Government&rsquo;s policies are bleeding ordinary workers, particularly young people, and the adjustments in the budget are minor by contrast.</P>
      <P>Similarly, yesterday, tax adjustments in recent years were not mentioned, which resulted in massive reductions in corporation tax. Since they were first introduced four years ago, big business has saved between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million in tax. Capital gains tax changes have massively enriched speculators and tax breaks for private hospitals have been maintained. Everything reflects the fact that the Government is utterly wedded to a right wing economic policy and neoliberal capitalism and working people are suffering. All the r&iacute;-r&aacute; and nonsense that accompanies the budget is a diversion from that basic fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Aire Iompair.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the new and expanded provision for child care services, including the new child care programme, in budget 2006 is a major and welcome landmark in the Government&rsquo;s policy on child services and the important issue of child care. As Minister with responsibility in recent years for the development of Ireland&rsquo;s child care infrastructure, I am particularly pleased with the new and expanded policy strategy and what I believe is a ringing endorsement for the work done under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 to develop a child care infrastructure in Ireland.</P>
      <P>While it has been argued in some quarters since the beginning of the EOCP that there was no logical connection between child care and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have been delighted with and proud of the way I was able to oversee and support the development of this programme at every step of the way. I pay tribute, in particular, to the staff of my Department who have done such an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The EOCP and its successor are a reflection of the commitment to child care which the Government has shown since coming into office in 1997 and its identification at that time of the need to take an active and urgent role in developing a child care infrastructure to assist parents with child care needs. I merely contrast it with what happened before.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When the EOCP was initiated under the national development plan in 2000 as a major infrastructural investment programme, with funding amounting to &euro;500,000 million over seven years, Ireland was effectively a greenfield site left to us by the rainbow coalition in terms of child care provision and child-centred policy. With this in mind, a clear decision was taken from the outset of the programme that we would need to plan for the future and, at the same time, address the immediate needs for child care services faced by parents. This latter need has been addressed to the extent that over 49,200 child care places and 2,300 staff are receiving grants and supports <Col N="86"/>under the programme, as are child minders who continue to play an important role in child care.</P>
      <P>This longer-term view of child care will pay dividends under the new policies for child services announced today by the Taoiseach as we are in a position to build on the holistic approach we have taken in the past. By this I mean that in addition to the provision of capital and staffing grant schemes to fund and develop child care services, the EOCP has from the start been much focused on the broader issues such as development of quality and training and of national and, in particular, key local structures at city and county child care committee level. The child care committees now provide the essential local infrastructure to enable co-ordinated children&rsquo;s services and child care policy to be developed to meet local needs.</P>
      <P>As a programme in receipt of EU funding, I am happy to say the EOCP has passed all its mid-term and other reviews with flying colours. It is, therefore, a success story in terms of delivering value for money while meeting its objectives and exceeding its original targets. The programme is highly regarded within the child care sector and has been commended by the social partners. I am glad to hand to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, charge of this programme in such excellent condition and the new expanded policy area into which it will sit. As Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he will be in a key position to bring key expertise and a demonstrated level of commitment to this new policy area.</P>
      <P>In recent months and weeks my officials have been working closely with those in the Department of Finance to bring about a policy framework for the next stage of the child care programme and its broader policy context. This has enabled work to be done to build on the achievements of the EOCP and to bring all the strands of child care policy together in a coherent and strategic manner and enable each of the relevant agencies and services to work together in a planned way. The outcome is an excellent one for progressive Government policy and will result in a more child-centred approach to and effective delivery of children&rsquo;s services as well as meeting its target of an additional 50,000 new child care places over the next five years.</P>
      <P>I understand the programme from 2006 to 2010 will invest a further &euro;575 million into the capital and current funding available. This is in addition to the EOCP funding which will be rolled out over the next two years. As an entirely Exchequer-funded programme, the level of funding is clearly a hugely significant response by the Government as an endorsement of the EOCP and as a commitment to the concerns of parents in relation to child care.</P>
      <P>I take the opportunity to reassure child care providers engaged in the equal opportunities childcare programme that it will continue to <Col N="87"/>operate to its end date and that there will be a smooth transition between the two programmes. I expect my staff to have available shortly full details of the new programme arrangements.</P>
      <P>While the EOCP has been under my remit, I have been fully committed to supporting it as a key area of Government policy serving the social and economic good of the State. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, well in his very important new policy remit.</P>
      <P>People, particularly the last speaker, have asked what is in this budget for ordinary families. Let us take a family with three children under the age of six and look at one small aspect of the budget, that is, child benefit and the new supplement. For the first child, it gets &euro;150 per month, for the second child, &euro;150 per month and for the third child, &euro;185 per month, making a total of &euro;485 per month. If one multiplies that by 12, one gets a figure of &euro;5,820 per year. If one adds a &euro;3,000 supplement to that, one is talking about a payment to that family of &euro;8,820 per annum. Let nobody say there is nothing in this budget for ordinary families struggling to bring up children in the economic circumstances of this State. That is the figure before tax relief.</P>
      <P>A sum of &euro;8,820 is the extent of the State&rsquo;s commitment to a family in those circumstances. It is a huge benefit to a family with young children. People have talked about the &euro;1,000 per annum payment as small beer. At the ordinary rate of income tax &mdash; the 20% rate &mdash; it is equivalent to an old-fashioned tax allowance of &euro;5,000. Let nobody say it is small beer, it is serious money. I am talking about a family with two parents and three children under the age of six which will get over &euro;8,000, at least &euro;3,500 of which is increased payments to it in support.</P>
      <P>I turn to the broader aspects of the budget. We have looked at the details of the Budget Statement to work out the implications of it for ourselves and our families. I wish to look at the economics behind the budget, but my contribution will not be technical or complicated. The key points of my contribution are capable of being delivered in six words &mdash; lower rates, higher yields, more resources. My essential point is that the lower tax rates provide higher revenue yields for the State which, in turn, lead to more generous levels of State resources. That has been my political philosophy and that of my party from its inception. When the Government was elected in 1997 the top rate of income tax was 48% and unemployment was 10.5%, the kind of level that causes scandal in Europe. The top rate of income tax is now 42%. The basic rate of income tax has dropped over the same period from 26% to<?oasys _jy?>20%, yet despite falling tax rates, income tax receipts to the State will have doubled from &pound;6 billion in 1997 to a targeted &euro;12 billion in 2006.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>When the Government was elected in 1997, the rate of tax on capital gains was 40%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>We were creating jobs at the same rate but we were not losing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Capital gains tax is now 20% and yet the State&rsquo;s yield from capital taxation has exploded from &pound;168 million in the glorious days of the rainbow coalition to a budgeted &euro;2.025 billion next year. Lower rates have again produced higher yields. I remember a Labour Party spokesman describing the plan of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy, to reduce the rate of capital gains tax from 40% to 20% as a fiscal obscenity. Let him look at the figures now.</P>
      <P>The same picture emerges when we look at corporation tax. Since 1995, the standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced to 12.5%. Let us see what has happened since 1995. Proceeds from corporation tax have jumped from &pound;2 billion to a budgeted &euro;6 billion in 2006. Lower tax in this case yet again produced higher yields.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to look at what has happened in the Irish taxation system. Since the mid-1990s the balance of the Irish taxation system has changed with the State collecting more of its total tax take from corporation and capital taxes. Curiously, once we got the left out of power, corporation and capital taxes went up as a proportion of tax receipts. Therefore, we need to collect less from income tax and value added tax. The share of the total tax take from corporation and capital gains tax together has risen from 14% of the total tax rate under the rainbow coalition to 26% now. There has been a corresponding reduction in the share contributed by income tax and value added tax from 86% under the left dominated rainbow coalition to 74% now.</P>
      <P>The benefits of our policies for ordinary working people can be illustrated looking at the income tax burden as it falls on a single person earning the average industrial wage. In 1997, a year when the economy was in great nick we are told, a person on the average industrial wage paid 28% income tax, more than a quarter of his or her income. By 2006, that will have fallen to just 16%. The reduction in the amount of tax taken from their wages has contributed to growing numbers of people wishing to work, as the Deputies opposite point out, and being able to find work, which is more important. Between 1997 and 2005, the total number of people work<Col N="89"/>ing in the economy has grown from 1.5 million to 2 million.</P>
      <P>The message from my party and our partners in Government is simple &mdash; lower rates produce higher yields and more jobs. Higher yields also provide for more spending. The Government has reduced tax rates and enjoyed rising tax yields. These increased tax revenues have allowed significant and generous increases in State spending. In 1997, net resources available to the Department of Health and Children under the rainbow coalition were &pound;3.3 billion. Next year, that Department will have resources of &euro;9.6 billion. Spending in that Department is up over 200% since 1997. The story is similar in other Departments. Resources for education are up 135% since 1997 and resources in the Department of Social and Family Affairs have more than doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is the Minister focusing on 1997? He should pick another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Because it was the last time when we were in a position to see the colour of the Opposition&rsquo;s money and how it can ruin an economy. Some will say that yesterday&rsquo;s budget was more of a Fianna F&aacute;il budget than a Progressive Democrats one. They will point to all the increased State spending as being a Fianna F&aacute;il goal rather than a Progressive Democrats one. I could not disagree more. It never was and is not Progressive Democrats doctrine to amass vast wealth just to sit on it and admire ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perching on telegraph poles is the Minister&rsquo;s approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is our goal to strengthen our economy so as to increase the opportunities people have to develop themselves to their full potential. Yesterday&rsquo;s spending increases are ones the Progressive Democrats fully stand over. They represent the fruits of a low tax, high yield economic strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>And no police. That is another promise that was not kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s this country tried the opposite approach to that which the Government is following. That mistaken policy produced the disastrous combination of high spending, high tax rates, high unemployment, low tax yields and a budget deficit spiralling out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Who started that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It was only the political arrival of the Progressive Democrats and the national threat of bankruptcy that led Ireland to abandon that failed policy. The result since then has been an endorsement of our economic logic and our political philosophy. However, not everyone sees <Col N="90"/>it that way. The Labour Party, for instance, cannot get rid of its reflexive instinct to meddle, muddle and increase taxes. Deputy Rabbitte stated in September 2005 that he wants to rebalance the income tax system. In essence, that means there is going to be more tax. Yet, the Labour Party ignores the fact we have already a highly progressive tax system.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record some figures certain people like to forget. The top 1% of income tax earners contribute 20% of total income tax receipts in our economy. Another 40% of total income tax receipts are paid by the top 4% of income tax earners. We have a broader, fairer and more progressive system of income tax and it will be made even fairer by yesterday&rsquo;s announcements limiting the size of private pensions and capping the availability of tax reliefs. That has always been a personal goal of mine; that nobody should be able to escape tax liability to the extent of being completely relieved of the tax burden because of clever tax planning and so avoid paying his or her share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might try to deal with the shootings around Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>And the stabbings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party wants to go beyond what we have done. It wants a wealth tax. Deputy Rabbitte stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 24 February 2003: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t simply say we will impose what are still pretty hefty taxes on work and no taxes on wealth&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A single person on the average industrial wage will pay just 16% of his or her income in income tax next year compared to 28% when the parties opposite were last in Government. If Deputy Rabbitte thinks taxes on work are pretty hefty now, what agonies must he have suffered around the Cabinet table when they were nearly twice as high? The second point to note about his desire for a wealth tax is that it would rapidly become a property tax. A wealth tax would operate only as a property tax because paper wealth can be transferred offshore but property cannot. The burden of a wealth tax would end up falling on to property. The sad fact is that the Labour Party ignores the lower rates, higher yields, more spending formula of the past decade. The party&rsquo;s absence from this debate speaks volumes. Beset by the impulses of a failed ideology, it would put our prosperity at risk.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that Deputy Rabbitte said recently he was there to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable. This shows the narrow, envy-driven ideology which lies at the back of his proposals. It is interesting that in these failed policies of the past, the Labour Party is joined by Sinn F&eacute;in, which wants to increase our rates of corporation tax and income tax. We just heard now for the first time that it also wants to increase <Col N="91"/>PRSI, to take away the ceiling on employees&rsquo; contribution. Now we know what is happening.</P>

	<P>While the Deputies&rsquo; local colleagues understand what is going on and are capable of seeing the benefits, obviously the colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann have a different view.</P>

	<P>Is that in between reading speeches which are 30 years old?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is typical of the two-faced look of Fine Gael every time it tries to put a policy forward.</P>
      <P>While the progress to date is real, it reinforces rather than questions the need for further sustained action to be underpinned by a clear vision of our objectives. The importance of transport to the economy cannot be underestimated. The National Competitiveness Council has consistently highlighted the need for investment in transport infrastructure in its annual competitiveness reports.</P>
      <P>Excellent progress has been made since Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats came into office in 1997. The road network has been and is being transformed, DART capacity has doubled, the Luas was built, there has been real rail improvements for the first time in decades and a renewed and expanded bus service is in place. These are real and tangible benefits, which we can too easily take for granted, and they have changed the transport experience for thousands of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is right about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was down to Fine Gael, there would be no public transport. If one looks at that party&rsquo;s record of investment, there would be nothing, the country would be at a standstill.</P>

	<P>At least we will be able to get into the tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>However, the figures indicate that their plan was to keep high levels of unemployment so that fewer people would try to go to work in those days. They yearn for the days when they could pretend to represent people in this country and promise to do things for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>He has tunnel vision on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The consistent experience of Irish people over three decades of Fine Gael in office with the Labour Party has been of abysmal results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we had as many consultants, it would have reduced unemployment levels no end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Challenges remain and our population is growing. As we become more prosperous, the number of two car households is increasing. Lifestyles are also changing. Decisions on changing jobs or houses are major ones which affect family life. House prices and not wishing to interrupt children&rsquo;s education impact on the way we live. This in turn impacts on transport infrastructure. These are the challenges presented by <Col N="95"/>a successful economy and the Government has set about meeting these challenges.</P>
      <P>In last year&rsquo;s budget, my Department was given the extraordinary opportunity by the Government to prepare a plan to transform this country&rsquo;s transport network with a ten-year financial framework. The opportunity was great but the challenge immense.</P>

	<P>A bit like electronic voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The leader of Fine Gael described current investment in Luas as a waste of time and a project that would never be realised. Dublin Fine Gael Deputies are singing a different tune today and are repeating the old nonsense they spoke prior to the Luas coming into operation for people in this gay capital city of ours.</P>
      <P>Budget 2006 represents the commencement of the &euro;34.4 billion investment in Transport 21. That programme will dramatically increase the choices available to transport users, enhance the ability of businesses to efficiently transport their goods and contribute to balanced regional development, as envisioned in the national spatial strategy and the regional planning guidelines. Most importantly, Transport 21 is about connectivity. It provides the basis for an integrated transport network, particularly for the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The availability of a ten-year funding framework has given us a unique opportunity to set out in Transport 21 a long-term investment programme for an integrated transport system. That investment will not come cheaply because the bill for Transport 21 will amount to a staggering &euro;34.4 billion. However, the pay-off will be a complete and welcome transformation of our transport system, not only for this generation but for those to come.</P>
      <P>Transport 21 will also provide for major investment in our regional airports, which have an important complementary role to play in promoting regional integration. Traffic to regional airports amounted to 1 million passengers in 2004. Regional airports can have a role to play in encouraging inward investment and tourism. <Col N="96"/>Budget 2006 outlines an injection of additional investment in our regional airports. In 2006, &euro;15 million is being allocated for capital grants to these airports, an &euro;11 million increase in one year.</P>
      <P>Budget 2006 ensures that Transport 21 gets off to an excellent start. The year ahead will see the continued roll-out of the motorway programme, construction of more bypasses across the country, the building of the new docklands railway station, the start of a process which will see the reopening of the western rail corridor, the Kildare rail routes, DART upgrading and the delivery of new rolling stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is for the short trains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government, through Transport 21 and backed by budget 2006, is working to deliver a transport infrastructure that supports economic activity across the nation and enhances the quality of life of every citizen. We will continue to work to build a 21st century infrastructure for a 21st century country, an infrastructure network that will connect communities and promote prosperity for generations to come.</P>
      <P>The challenge is for other political parties to state what they would not do in the context of all the actions being taken by the Government and to spell out where they would spend money if they ever got into power.</P>

	<P>That is the sort of financial rectitude and management that Fine Gael, Labour, the Green Party and others are bringing to this debate. It is well past a reasonable time for certain people to spell out how they are going to spend the people&rsquo;s money and explain why they are unhappy with how we are spending the resources of the people. This is the most dynamic <Col N="97"/>economy in the world. It is one of the most socially cohesive and successful countries in the world. It is a country of challenges, the great challenges of a very successful economy. We no longer have to deal with the challenges of failure, the legacy of failure through which Fine Gael and Labour led this country for three decades. On each occasion, Fianna F&aacute;il had to come back into Government not alone to sort out the mess they left but also to develop this country.</P>

	<P>The proof is there. The number of people at work has grown from 1.2 million to almost 2 million. We reduced unemployment to levels of 4%. We are the most dynamic and successful economy in Europe. We have social cohesion, investment in education, health and services, along with the development of the local government structure, the national spatial strategy, Transport 21, and now a major roll-out, in the charge of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, of the child care provision programme going forward.</P>

	<P>As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said a few moments ago, who would have believed a few years ago that a family with three children under six years of age would be getting a payment from the State of nearly &euro;8,500? That is an incredible commitment by Fianna F&aacute;il in Government to the people. This Government, with the policies and philosophies which have underpinned it for more than ten years, and in reality back to 1997, has created balance and fairness, redistributing wealth and ensuring that everyone had an opportunity to fulfil their dreams, to work, to get their children into second and third level education and to access right across the spectrum.</P>
      <P>Once and for all we ended the curse of lost generations. We were at a stage where some 40,000 young people were emigrating in years past. Now we have reached the stage of immigration into Ireland. People of the world want to be in Ireland. People in Europe want to be here, to work here, to live here and participate in Irish society. We are becoming a much more dynamic, cosmopolitan society but one founded on what true democratic republicanism is about. That is what underpins and characterises this country today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Twomey and Enright.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget. It is an important opportunity to highlight significant weaknesses from the point of view of agriculture. We are now in an environment structured by the CAP reform, the WTO negotiations, the impending nitrates action plan and the impending closure of our sugar industry. I had hoped that in that context we would have seen some positive developments from the Minister for Finance in his presentation yesterday, but he ignored the entire area.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of where I thought some progress might have been made. We are currently spending 4% of our total research and development budget on the food industry. The food industry in this country is worth more than &euro;11 billion annually. It accounts for 24% of our exports, yet just 4% of the total R&amp;D budget is spent in that area, with nothing done to address the deficit.</P>
      <P>Agricultural incomes have collapsed. Last week, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, was pictured all over the place with numerous lovely cheques from the single farm payment scheme, but in reality the average farmer in Ireland will have an income this year of &euro;15,557. That includes the single farm payment. Out of that, input costs come to &euro;15,478, and the Government&rsquo;s stealth charges put in place over the past few years come to an another &euro;3,978. Based on those figures, what the single farm payment amounts to for the average Irish farmer is a nett loss of &euro;75 per week.</P>
      <P>Farmers are not benefitting from the single farm payment. Yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture and Food paid lip service to the issue of agriculture. One key objective raised by all the farming organisations was that of farm consolidation. Some 30% of farms are in four or more parcels of land and for the past few years farming organisations have been pleading for the introduction of roll-over relief in relation to stamp duty for farmers who want to improve their efficiency and consolidate their farms. No recognition was given to that yesterday.</P>
      <P>We have the crazy situation where Deputy Parlon, when leader of the IFA, negotiated a deal with the Government with regard to the compulsory purchase of land whereby farmers would get roll-over relief in regard to capital gains tax. The moment Deputy Parlon joined the Government benches, after the election, he and the Minister for Finance rescinded the deal made. Farmers are now being taxed on the compulsory purchase of land by the State with regard to our motorways around the country. A gun is being put to their <Col N="99"/>heads and the Government then takes 20% in tax off the compulsory purchase price given. That is an immoral, disgraceful situation, and a spineless Minister is not prepared to even discuss the matter in the House. That is the reality farmers must deal with on a daily basis. The issue of farm consolidation was completely ignored in the budget even though the Minister paid lip service to agriculture.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of what the budget means to farmers. A progressive farmer with an income of &euro;30,000 per annum and two children over the age of six has benefitted from the budget by &euro;5 weekly. Admittedly, if he had two children under the age of six, he would benefit by &euro;33 weekly. However, the Minister also made an announcement yesterday with regard to the PAYE tax credit. This has increased by &euro;220 to &euro;1,490, which means farmers are losing that additional tax credit because they happen to be self-employed. They are losing out compared to other taxpayers within the economy and no recognition has been given to their income loss and the dramatic fall-off in income which has taken place over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Farm families and home carers did not get one extra cent from this Government. The tax credit of &euro;770 was not touched in the budget. Incentives were given with regard to betting tax but there was nothing for the housewife who decides to stay at home and care for her children. No recognition was afforded her, nor was there any recognition for those caring for the elderly with regard to the tax system. They were completely ignored.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is a great misfortune that we do not recognise women who work on farms and in homes in rural Ireland. Many of them work in partnership with their husbands. In some cases they own the land, but because tax and PRSI are paid by the husband, no recognition is given to these women with regard to social welfare. That is wrong and needs to be examined. No recognition was given to them in this budget with regard to the home carer&rsquo;s credit. Anyone with children and unfortunate enough to be on social welfare, whether it be farm assist or any other form of welfare, gets no recognition in terms of the child dependant allowance. It did not increase by one cent in this budget, even though this Government is supposed to be prioritising children in the budget. Those in the most marginal elements of society were completely ignored compared to other earners in society.</P>
      <P>There was a silver lining with regard to biofuels. The Minister for Agriculture and Food was rushing out of the Chamber yesterday, tripping over herself to welcome that. However, in order to avail of the new biofuels package, one has to convert vehicles, and many people will not go to the cost of converting their vehicles to take biofuels. We should have introduced a measure whereby one could blend biofuels into existing fuels. In Austria, for example, 5% of the biofuel <Col N="100"/>produced is mixed with petrol and 2% with diesel. Such products could be used in all vehicles and would ensure a major take-up of biofuels. It would also provide the incentive to farmers to grow biofuels. Such a measure was not introduced in this budget, however. Instead, more money was taken from farmers in terms of the VAT refund for non-VAT registered farmers. Last year, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that this provision would be reviewed this year. However, he has turned his back on farmers in this regard. Input costs have risen, returns have fallen and farmers are losing at least 1% in this area. Based on their current tight margins, this will have a significant impact.</P>
      <P>The measures regarding stamp duty for young trained farmers are a positive development. There are many more anomalies, however, in inheritance tax and stamp duty which have not been addressed. The issue of land leases was examined but inter-family land leases are ignored. Many farming families lease their land to a son or daughter but no recognition was given to this issue by the Minister for Finance. He clapped himself on the back about the &euro;1 billion multi-annual budget for farm investment. The reality, however, is that this &euro;1 billion budget will be taken up in implementing the prescriptive rules laid down under the nitrates directive. It will not lead to any additional efficiency but rather to additional costs and regulations for farmers and the possibility of being prosecuted for using one bag of fertiliser more than set out in the rules. That is what has been proposed by the Government and what it plans to implement. There is very little in this for farmers and farming families.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance yesterday announced &euro;110 million for services for the elderly. This is a far cry from the &euro;160 million that has been lost on the PPARS system. Three weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children came to County Roscommon and paid lip-service to the issue of services for the elderly there. We cannot recruit the specialist staff to provide these services no matter how much money is allocated. An allocation of &euro;110 million or even &euro;1 billion is no good unless we address the issue of recruitment.</P>
      <P>When the T&aacute;naiste visited Roscommon she also made the announcement that she would appoint a third consultant physician at the county hospital in Roscommon. However, she did not inform us that it would be a temporary appointment for a six-month period. The Government adopts a deceptive attitude on these and other issues. It speaks with a forked tongue about every commitment it has given and then goes behind our backs and undermines what has already been delivered. This is a spineless Government that is prepared to make announcements but not to implement and deliver its promises. A prime example of this is the guillotine hanging over the accident and emergency unit at the county <Col N="101"/>hospital in Roscommon. The T&aacute;naiste will not be back there for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The main focus in yesterday&rsquo;s budget was child care. To listen to the earlier contribution of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, one would believe there are no transport problems or only a minor one that will be solved by him through Transport 21. The issue of child care exploded onto the political scene, as far as the Government was concerned, during the by-elections in Meath and Kildare North. For residents there and elsewhere, the problem of child care is as much a matter of paying for it as of getting to see their children. Some parents leave home at 7 a.m. and do not return until 7 p.m.</P>
      <P>No Government Members ever ask: &ldquo;What about the children?&rdquo; If they made some minor inquiries, they would realise there is now a much greater prevalence of behavioural problems among children. Many are put on medication, the need for which is doubtful. Many of these problems arise in a context where children see very little of their parents. The Government can produce figures of &euro;150 per month and &euro;1,000 per year but the problem is the commuting times that keep parents apart from their young children. In some cases, children believe their minder is a parent because they spend more waking hours with the minder than with their parents. The focus on child care does not take account of the child and the Government is failing completely in this regard. Ministers get a quick glimpse of an idea on the front page of the newspapers and go with that. The focus is unbelievably narrow.</P>
      <P>It was first announced in the 2003 budget that excise relief would be given to farmers who grow biofuels, such as oilseed rape, and convert them into oil for vehicles. It was a year and half later, however, before any concessions were made in this regard. This is similar to the decentralisation experience. Developments take place so slowly under this Government that a five-year plan is needed for any initiative. The first year is to announce a scheme and the next four years are taken up with some form of implementation before the next general election takes place.</P>
      <P>This time last year, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children announced the ten-point plan for accident and emergency services. There was much fanfare about how she would solve the problems in this area. Some 200,000 doctor-only medical cards were to be introduced along with 30,000 regular cards. This Government has a major credibility problem because it does not deliver on its announcements. It is as if Ministers believe that all that must be done each year is to come out with a new set of announcements and they will be doing a good job.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is particularly affected by this affliction. If he were to announce in the morning that he plans to drain the River Shannon, many people would find this more credible than his Transport 21 announce<Col N="102"/>ment. People no longer believe what the Government says because they are aware of how it wastes money. We have had the PPARS and FISP systems. We have a health strategy that has not been delivered in the most minor way after five years. One could trip over Ministers making daily announcements about broadband. However, the Government has failed to deliver in this regard.</P>
      <P>In regard to the health service, only &euro;110 million was announced for the care of older people. We must ask whether this is enough and whether the Government will deliver. I suspect more will be delivered in 2006 for the simple reason that not since 2001 have we seen the Government making an effort on any of these issues. That this is a pre-election year is the only reason we might see something delivered. Nothing has been delivered in the past four years. The &euro;110 million could be divided to cater for the needs of older people living in their own homes and those needing nursing home care.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s announcement today gives the impression that subvention rates have increased in the nursing home sector but this is not the case. The same rates that have applied since 2001 &mdash; between &euro;130 and &euro;190 &mdash; will apply next year. The only aspect that has changed is that the means testing is altered slightly. What is important, however, is that average costs of nursing homes, especially in the greater Dublin region, vary between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500. The change desired by those who require nursing home care was an increase in rates so that families could more easily avail of private nursing home care. There are very few public nursing home beds and there has been an overall reduction in numbers since 2001.</P>
      <P>In her speech the T&aacute;naiste laid great emphasis on the fact that one in three people in nursing homes, both public and private, could stay in their own homes if there were appropriate nursing or home help. It must be a long time since the T&aacute;naiste visited a public nursing home if she believes that one in three patients could return home. The reasons patients are in nursing homes in the first place is that their immobility or illness does not allow them to live at home. The actual cost of private nursing home care is not in line with the pathetically low level of grant assistance.</P>

	<P>The recent agreement reached by EU Ministers at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council about the reform of the EU sugar regime was the culmination of a protracted and difficult negotiating process. The outcome represents the best deal that could have been achieved for Irish beet growers in the circumstances. It represents a considerable improvement on the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposals, which were made last June. The main features of the agreement are a lower reduction &mdash; 36% rather than 39% &mdash; than originally proposed in the support price of sugar; a phased introduction of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, rather than the two-step reduction that was originally proposed; an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years; a one-off payment of almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers if sugar beet production ceases in Ireland; and an aid package of up to &euro;145 million to meet the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry in the event of factory closure and the renunciation of quota. The entire compensation package for Ireland has an estimated value of more than &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>Beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited will be responsible for making decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime. A one-off payment of almost &euro;44 million will be available for growers, as I have said, if sugar production in Ireland ceases. In such circumstances, a restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million will be made available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs of factory closure. The agreement provides that at least 10% of that fund will be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors, to compensate them for losses arising from their investment in specialised machinery. The fund may be increased by member states after they consult interested parties, as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is balanced in line with a sound economic proposal.</P>
        <P>Formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year, after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. It is not possible to give further definitive information in advance of the adoption of the relevant regulations. The Department of Agriculture and Food will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course, as it did during the earlier phases of Common Agricultural Policy reform.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="104"/>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Based on the current proposals, 70% of the income of beet growers will have disappeared by 2008. Does the Minister see a future for sugar production in Ireland? What steps can be taken to ensure that the sugar production industry has a viable future? At least 10% of the funds allocated under the proposed compensation package will be given to sugar beet growers and machinery contractors, but I understand that the Minister rejected a proposal to increase the relevant percentage to 25%. Why did she reject the proposal to assign 25% of moneys to such people?</P>
        <P>I would like to ask about the restructuring budget of &euro;145 million. We accept that those funds will not be used to restructure Greencore but to close the remaining sugar plant. Sugar beet growers have invested in quota, land and machinery, but it seems that 90% of the funds which will be made available will be focused on Greencore rather than on the growers. I understand that member states have the flexibility to top up that level of payment. Does the Minister plan to consider such an approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reform of the EU sugar regime is still in its early stages, as I have said. We are awaiting the final official legal text from the European Union. Growers will be able to participate in the sugar regime over the next two years. That will be a matter for growers and for Irish Sugar Limited. I would like to respond to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s suggestion that I rejected a proposal to allow growers to be given 25% of the available funds. At approximately 3.30 a.m. or 4 a.m. on the night of the negotiations, the Irish delegation decided to renegotiate after the blocking minority of 11 member states decreased in size when a number of member states withdrew from it. I decided at that stage to support the proposal to offer compensation. A number of permutations were suggested for consideration and I expressed my views on the need to afford maximum flexibility to member states. The decision to provide that a minimum of 10% of the funds should be given to growers and contractors was taken on foot of that discussion.</P>
        <P>It is important to say two things about the restructuring fund. It will be made available only on the renunciation of quota. It will be possible to use up to 75% of the fund if the sugar factory gets involved in alternative forms of production, such as the production of bioethanol or other biofuels. All such matters are being considered at present, but no definitive decisions have been made. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and I met farmers, the people of Mallow, the representative association and some of the retired workers, and we will take part in further discussions with all those involved in the sugar industry. I appreciate that this is a difficult matter. The sugar regime will continue in 2006 and 2007, at least. I hope those who wish to continue their involvement in the sugar industry will <Col N="105"/>have an opportunity to do so over the next two years despite the price reductions, which have not been as bad as we had anticipated.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the recent Foresight Rural Ireland 2025 document; what she intends to do to ensure its predictions as to the number of full-time farmers there will be in 2025 do not come true; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P Just="Left">A report that was launched recently, Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight Perspectives, was compiled by a working group from NUI Maynooth, UCD and Teagasc. The report outlines the group&rsquo;s perspective on rural Ireland in 2025 and gives its view on &ldquo;alterative outcomes for the Irish rural economy in the next 20 years&rdquo;. According to the report, it is unlikely that Ireland will have appreciably more than 10,000 full-time commercial farmers and 30,000 part-time farmers in 2025. The report does not contain a detailed analysis that gives the rationale for such figures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A more detailed analysis of farm numbers was published in Report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee, an independent report that was compiled by a committee chaired by Mr. Alan Dukes. Appendix 4 of the report consists of a 15-page in-depth analysis of projected farm numbers. The appendix suggests that there will be 105,000 farms in Ireland in 2015, which will be a reduction from 136,000 farms in 2002, and that 40,000 of the farms will be classified as viable, which will be an increase from 38,700 farms in that category in 2002.</P>
        <P>One section of Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight Perspectives appears to accept the analysis contained in Report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee. The latter report gives a detailed breakdown of the numbers and explains why the agri vision committee predicts there will be a reduction in the number of farms to 105,000 in 2015. It cites the increase in the popularity of part-time farming, the stabilising effects of the single farm payment and the availability of off-farm employment as factors which will underpin the continuing importance of farming, particularly part-time farming.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the reduction in farm numbers. Ireland is not alone, as there is a global trend, in this regard. Overall farm numbers are decreasing in all developed countries, including Ireland. The rate of decrease in this country is far lower than in several of our European neighbours. The Government is focused on ensuring that the best possible options are available to farming families to allow them to stay on the land. People may be able to continue in the agriculture industry as full-time farmers, if their <Col N="106"/>farm sizes and resources are sufficient and if they choose that option, or they may do so by means of a combination of on-farm and off-farm income, which many smaller farmers consider to be the best way to maintain a viable life on the land.</P>
        <P Italics="Y" el="10">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to supporting and encouraging farm families in whatever option they choose. The Department of Agriculture and Food will consult shortly with stakeholders on a new rural development strategy, to run from 2007 to 2013. The strategy and its complementary support measures will be based on the EU framework that was agreed in September, which places an emphasis on competitiveness, environment, quality of life and diversification of the rural economy. I am confident that the new strategy will contribute significantly to the economic and social well-being of rural areas.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. When one examines the total numbers of farmers outlined in Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight Perspectives and in Report of the Agri Vision 2015 Committee, one will accept that they are not a million miles apart. The latter report states there will be 12,500 viable dairy farmers and the former report states there will be 10,000 such farmers. It is not a huge gap.</P>
        <P>Some 1,500 non-viable part-time dairy farmers and 1,500 transitional dairy farms are identified in the report of the agri-vision 2015 committee. Both those sets of figures are negative in the sense of maintaining a rural farming economy rather than just an entire rural environment, which is what we should be considering. Three key enabling measures are set out in Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight Perspectives, and I would like to know the discussions the Minister of State plans to have with the other stakeholders in rural Ireland to ensure farming remains viable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2015 programme will be progressed in 2006. We all want a prosperous rural economy. Ireland must also adopt the Rural Development Regulation 2007-2013. This will be followed by detailed support measures. The consultative process with stakeholders will commence in coming weeks and I hope we will have that with the Commission in March or April. The programmes setting out support measures will be sent in the following three months or so. The range of support measures is very wide and covers the three broad objectives of competitiveness, environment, quality of life and diversification of the rural economy. While we regard the report of the agri-vision 2015 committee as being more detailed as it outlines how farming numbers could decrease by 2015, both reports are helpful. We will consider both reports and take on board the good points from both.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Political agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime was reached at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 24 November 2005. It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime. The reform agreement, as the Minister has already outlined, includes a compensation package with a potential value of more than &euro;300 million for Ireland, including measures that will apply in the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland.</P>
        <P>While the production of ethanol from sugar beet is a possible alternative outlet for farmers, as matters stand, Irish Sugar Limited has arrangements in place to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant which has been upgraded for that purpose. The question of establishing a bioethanol plant based on sugar beet would be a matter for commercial decision.</P>
        <P>In future, under the decoupled system of support payments, farmers will only grow crops which provide an economic return. The announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s budget of the excise duty relief scheme to cover 163 million litres of biofuels per year when the relief is fully operational should stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This is a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>To encourage the growing of sugar beet as an energy crop, the European Commission intends during 2006 to amend the relevant regulations to allow sugar beet to qualify for set-aside payments when cultivated as a non-food crop, and also to be made eligible for the energy crop aid of &euro;45 per hectare. The sugar reform agreement also permits the partial dismantling of a sugar factory and the continued use of the production site for the production of non-food products such as bioethanol. In these circumstances, the final agree<Col N="108"/>ment provided that 75% of the restructuring aid be payable. This represented an increase on what the Commission originally proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, announced significant increases in the excise duty relief for the production of biofuels which is intended to boost the biofuel industry in the State. He also stated that this measure would require EU approval as a state aid. Does the Minister of State agree that the State should also request that the range of energy crops covered by production grants should include beet? The two areas most affected in two years&rsquo; time will be Mallow and Carlow. Jobs have already been lost in Carlow and among those growing beet in the south east. Getting beet nominated as a source of biofuel would be a way to make a transition into biofuel production. I had other questions which were already asked by Deputy Naughten and answered by the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>As I come from the south east, I have had numerous meetings with farmers&rsquo; organisations in recent weeks about possible alternatives for the beet industry, one of which relates to ethanol. Other areas in the beet industry need to be resolved first. Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Finance of excise duty relief for biofuels of &euro;20 million in 2006, &euro;35 million in 2007 and &euro;50 million in each year from 2008 to 2010, inclusive, is a welcome boost for the biofuel industry. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and I have pursued this matter with the Minister for Finance for a number of months. We will consider the possibility of exploring opportunities to use sugar beet, oilseed rape, wheat and other crops to develop biofuels. The Deputy can take it that beet will be included and will be very high on the agenda in our discussions with farmers&rsquo; organisations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the response of the Minister of State that he will try to get sugar beet included. I stress its importance as it is a rotation crop grown by 3,700 farmers. Usually beet, barley and potatoes are used as rotation crops. Including it for biofuel production would assist all those involved in such rotation crops.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>When the sugar company and the farmers&rsquo; organisations sort out the difficulties, I hope that beet will be grown in 2006 and 2007. Later we can consider the production of ethanol and other alternatives. We are also considering the area of willows. Next year we will introduce a pilot scheme to produce a certain number of hectares. That would also be an important rotation crop. We are also considering all the ideas the Deputy is proposing.</P>

        <asker>Mr. Naughten</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the status of the nitrates directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37740/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme was formally submitted to the European Commission in July, and regulations giving legal effect to it are being finalised following a consultation process. Ireland is also proceeding with the case for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. The derogation proposes to cater for grassland farms. Discussions with the Commission on the derogation are under way.</P>
        <P>While the implementation of the action programme will certainly have implications for farmers, I have taken important measures to alleviate the impact on the sector. I have announced proposals for a revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now being sought. The improved scheme will increase the grant rate for both animal housing and slurry storage from the current rate of 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in some counties.</P>
        <P>Other elements of the scheme will include significantly higher investment ceilings, the extension of the scheme to sectors such as pigs and poultry and the removal of any minimum income requirement from farming from the scheme. I hope early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming from the European Commission so that it can be introduced quickly. I also intend to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector meet the requirements of the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>Some concerns have been expressed about the impact of the directive on the pig and poultry sectors where many of the larger producers do not have enough land of their own to use the manure they produce. I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers to continue to have adequate spreadlands for pig slurry. I have therefore asked Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. I will urge REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also seek to ensure that the necessary record keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s officials and officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government admitted at a committee meeting that they accept there are transitional difficulties for pig and poultry <Col N="110"/>producers, yet none is prepared to put a structure in place to facilitate transition to the new scheme. Will the Minister direct them to do so? In regard to the information being provided by Teagasc to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government via the Department of Agriculture and Food for the P index, why is it that the Teagasc rules and guidelines for REPS are being thrown out the window? Teagasc has stated that the information furnished to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is not legally binding as there is no scientific evidence to back it and yet it is used by that Department as being legally binding under the nitrates directive. Will the Minister ask the director of Teagasc to clarify the position as he appears to have a different story from that of Dr. Cross and the scientific experts within Teagasc?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been confusion in regard to the precedent of the Netherlands&rsquo; rules and regulations on fertiliser standards, for which the purposes of the nitrates directive and the standards operating in that country have a proper legal basis in the Netherlands. They are not merely recommendations or guidelines. I understand from my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, that he has spoken to the director of Teagasc today. The director confirmed to the Minister that the information Teagasc had in regard to the non-binding nature of the application limits of the Netherlands was based on a non-file draft of the regulations. Teagasc has since confirmed that the fertiliser limits in the finalised Dutch regulation are mandatory and Teagasc is writing to the Minister to confirm that it has the same understanding in this regard. On the issue of the regulations being changed particularly to look at the soil sampling index, the position is that the nutrient value will only be reflective of the crop requirement and, therefore, any call for the regulation to be changed in the absence of soil sampling for the use of phosphorus index 2 will not be accepted by the Commission. I accept, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, there has been clarification on the issue from Teagasc. The position is as stated. Teagasc has confirmed to the Minister the issue regarding the non-factual position in the Netherlands. The confusion has been clarified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is it not the case that Dr. Cross wrote to the Department of Agriculture and Food stating that the information given by Teagasc to the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in regard to a P index of 2 could not be substantiated legally? Will the Minister confirm if that is the position? REPS plans are considered good farming practice throughout the <Col N="111"/>European Union. The REPS plans in Ireland are restrictive in comparison with those in many other countries. Given that only 12 months remain in the REPS scheme the current P index of 3 could remain in place on those REPS plans until revised, as the Minister&rsquo;s officials have said they will not amend the documentation in the meantime but yet they want to change the rules.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the letter from Teagasc to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government it recommended the nutrient application standards should be used as guidance tables only and not included in legislation. It is not an option. The Minister has spoken to the director of Teagasc on this matter and clarification has been sought and received. On the issue of REPS, it is appropriate that we take some of the stress being experienced by people on this issue. That is the reason I have asked Teagasc to be proactive. I have also asked that the REPS planners be brought in and that the issue of fertiliser substitution to organic will be the process of the day. I am also considering the issue of soil sampling. Therefore, if a farmer is in a position to say to me on a soil sample that it is a different index, he or she will be free to do so but at the end of the day crop requirement will be the prerequisite as opposed to the soil sample. On that basis, all support that is necessary to deal with this issue will be forthcoming. My officials meet in the Department and the officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider a response to the Commission with a view to bringing this matter to finality fairly quickly.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>if she is satisfied with the traceability systems that are applied to Brazilian beef; the way in which she is satisfied that beef producers here are not compromised due to the extensive traceability systems demanded of beef produced here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the EU and the World Trade Organisation, WTO, Ireland is in a position to avail of opportunities for trade that are essential for the development of our open economy. Membership of these organisations also brings reciprocal trade obligations. The principle is that imported animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries that have been approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on <Col N="112"/>important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. In this context I wrote to the Commissioner Kyprianou concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. In his reply the Commissioner outlined that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU.</P>
        <P>The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. It has regularly carried out inspections in Brazil also with respect to the points of concern raised in my letter and has taken appropriate measures whenever necessary. He indicates the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of restrictive measures in relation to the finding of residues of unauthorised substances in poultry meat and the quick and proportionate protective measures applied to imports of beef, as a result of the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, FMD, in Brazil, demonstrate the Commission&rsquo;s primary objective of maintaining the high sanitary status of the Community and respecting the EU commitment under the WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the operation of EU controls on exports in Brazil the Commissioner indicated that an FVO inspection to evaluate animal health and public health control systems, traceability and certification procedures in place in that country has recently been carried out. Following consultation with the Brazilian competent authorities on its findings, which is not yet complete, the FVO will issue a report. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister is aware, there is concern in the beef industry in regard to the amount of imports from Brazil specifically. Questions have been highlighted in regard to the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease which have alerted us to the fact that there may be underlying problems in countries such as Brazil of which we are unaware. Given that the Minister said regular inspections are carried out by the FVO, what is the frequency of those inspections? What percentage of the factories from which we purchase beef are tested and how regularly are <Col N="113"/>those tests carried out? On the issue of labelling we can no longer have a choice. That is the key issue from a consumer point of view. There is a beef industry problem but there is a consumer perception that the consumer is disadvantaged and has no idea of the origin of that product at catering level.</P>

	<P>I wholeheartedly agree on the issue of labelling. Our colleagues in the Seanad are involved in drafting legislation that will hopefully be introduced in this House at the beginning of the next term so we can introduce law on the issue of labelling. We all agree on the necessity of labelling.</P>
        <P>The FVO carried out a number of audits and inspections between 2001 and 2004 on production and export controls and on residue controls operated by the Brazilian competent authorities. The audits were taken in compliance with the provisions of EU legislation on food hygiene and health conditions for the productions and placing on the market of certain products intended for human consumption and in accordance with the conditions under which Brazil has been approved by the EU to trade in certain animal products.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As I indicated, a recent investigation was carried out by the FVO. I instigated a letter to the Commissioner on the basis of the concerns expressed. Many recommendations were made to the Commission from the FVO arising from those. Reviews were carried out on action plans submitted by the Brazilians and consideration of further control measures in light of assurances received. I await the outcome of the FVO report. Hopefully it will be available soon so we can see if our concerns have been addressed.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the reason an estimated 16,000 to 20,000 tonnes of Brazilian beef is imported here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>While imports of beef into Ireland in 2004 amounted to 22,881 tonnes, beef exports of almost 500,000 tonnes were made from Ireland to worldwide destinations. Accordingly, Ireland supports a system that facilitates orderly trade while taking account of animal health.</P>
        <P>The operation of harmonised EU legislation governing animal health, production and trade in animal products such as meat, takes account of the EU negotiated position within the WTO. The principle is that imported animal products meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. Imports of animal products must come from third countries or areas of third countries that are members of the International Organisation for Animal Health, OIE, and that have been <Col N="114"/>approved for each particular animal product to export to the EU.</P>
        <P>Where an animal disease outbreak occurs in an approved third country it must be notified to the OIE. Where there are risks for the Community in terms of public health or economic production, the Commission will immediately deal with the issue at the standing committee on the food chain and animal health, SCoFCAH, and table proposals appropriate to remove any risks arising from trade.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Irish farmers are required to ensure their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>As I indicated in my previous reply, I wrote to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, on these issues and he indicated that his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and livestock. He also assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take appropriate protection measures if a product imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Minister questions on three aspects of this. Does the Minister agree the price of Irish beef has been adversely affected by the flood, in comparative terms to other beef imports, of imports from Brazil? The IFA estimates the impact was a price reduction of the order of &euro;130 per head in June, July, August and September. Since the partial ban was imposed in early October, prices recovered by approximately &euro;60 or &euro;70 per head. Does the Minister agree with that estimation?</P>
        <P>Closer to the heart of what we are dealing with is traceability. I heard the Minister state that Irish farmers are expected to comply with the highest of standards and Irish farmers agree with and support that. Is there any impediment to ensuring traceability in the catering sector to the same extent as the retail sector, so people in the catering sector are forced to declare they are selling Brazilian beef? Why is that not done? It seems it needs to be done.</P>
        <P>Champions of free trade such as the US and Japan have a total ban on Brazilian beef. From a health point of view, should we have a total ban while there is foot and mouth disease in Brazil?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The questions cover a number of issues. These are the concerns expressed regarding the WTO negotiations. Labelling is extremely important. It was available and is available in the retail sector. It is not available and has not been available in the catering or food pro<Col N="115"/>duction sector. That will change through legislative measures that hopefully come before the House soon. I agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a broken record. The Minister stated that last January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The broken record is sitting in the Seanad. If Deputy Naughten has a problem with the Seanad he should take it up with his Senators. They all agreed that this Bill should be implemented as quickly as possible. We are all in agreement. It will happen and I will take a strict approach to the labelling of beef and this will continue to other products.</P>
        <P>Equivalence and equality are the issues. I have raised the concerns we all have on traceability, identification and residues with the Commissioner. As I indicated in my response, the FVO is dealing with it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The overall problem is that within the European Union we have a beef deficit. Banning the importation of beef would be problematic from a food availability point of view. That said, I feel if we introduce measures to ensure people are aware and consumers are informed, they will make choices. The issue of the price of beef is equally important to us. I have a problem with other countries, particularly the United States, telling us we must import Brazilian beef while they are not prepared to do so, nor are they prepared to allow us to export our beef to the United States, Japan or North Korea. This is the main issue with which we need to deal at WTO level.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to fully ban beef from Brazil on the basis that it is regionalised. During the foot and mouth disease crisis here, we used regionalisation to ensure we had a continuity of production available to the market.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>

As I stated, the FVO is investigating it and will report shortly to the Commissioner, who has given his indications to me in writing.</P>
        <P>I did not state that traceability, food safety and food security are not important. If we are to have a balanced outcome in the WTO negotiations, it must be reflected in equal access to the markets. This is why I am concerned about the current unbalanced proposal.</P>
        <P>We must deal with a matter about which many people do not want to hear. I recently met my Italian colleague, who is interested in the support of Irish beef in the retail sector, and we are doing well at that level.

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, recently granted the Republic&rsquo;s first two licences for commercial waste incinerators subject to stringent conditions. A priority task for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, since it was established in 1999 has been to monitor the food supply for contamination by dioxins. Concerning the introduction of waste incineration in Ireland as part of a national waste management strategy, the FSAI considers that such incineration facilities, if properly managed, will not contribute to dioxin levels in the food supply to any significant extent and will not affect food quality or safety. In order to maximise consumer protection, it is vital that rigorous monitoring programmes be maintained and that consideration be given to expanding environmental monitoring around any established incineration facilities.</P>
        <P>Emissions from the plants will be actively monitored by the EPA to ensure that the limit values in place are not exceeded. The EPA has held discussions with the FSAI with a view to putting in place a monitoring strategy to ensure that food produced in the areas surrounding the incinerators does not pose any danger to consumers.</P>
        <P>I understand the FSAI is satisfied that Irish foodstuffs will not be adversely affected by the introduction of the two new incineration facilities announced by the EPA, provided these facilities maintain the rigorous controls on emissions which will be part of the EPA licensing controls and provided the monitoring programme on foodstuffs currently under discussion between the FSAI and the EPA is put in place. The FSAI will continue to maintain a surveillance programme for levels of environmental contaminants including dioxins in Irish food, independent of this monitoring programme.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P>Provided these measures are put in place, the FSAI considers the current low levels of these contaminants in Irish food will continue, and will provide a positive incentive for consumers and importers in other countries to purchase Irish food exports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineMurphy"><NameTxt>Ms C. Murphy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister values the clean environment in which food is grown. Does she regret the decision to grant licences to these facilities?</P>
        <P>Belgium had a problem with dioxins that affected the poultry industry some years ago and this contaminated the reputation of poultry there. What measures will the Minister put in place if such a problem occurs here? The EPA will provide spot checks rather than having someone on site. What inputs will the Minister have to rigorous assessments? If the FSAI discovers a problem, it will be too late.</P>
        <P>Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Brien undertook research and complained when a similar facility was proposed near his farm in Tipperary. The facility was withdrawn because of the proximity of racehorses. Are racehorses affected by dioxins in a different way to people?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Racehorses are treated differently in the tax system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot make a personal comment because it is outside my jurisdiction. This is a matter for the EPA and it has gone through due process. In granting the licence, the EPA was satisfied that, subject to conditions, the incinerators would not endanger human health or harm the environment. The conditions require the operator to carry out monitoring programmes 20 times per year, ten times more than what is requested by the EU. The Office of Environmental Enforcement will monitor and enforce conditions through environmental audits, site visits and checks of emissions.</P>
        <P>I respect the independence of the FSAI, its valued contribution to food safety, its assurances and its proactive manner of addressing concerns. Once the conditions have been finalised, the FSAI and the EPA will do the job well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply was very conditional, stating there would be no impact to any significant extent if properly managed. Is the Minister concerned about the EPA carrying out monitoring, as it seems more interested in prosecuting pig farmers throughout the country than monitoring dioxins?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the same concerns as Deputy Naughten. The Minister&rsquo;s statement contained the phrase &ldquo;if properly managed&rdquo; and we need assurances on how this management will be monitored. Is continuous monitoring possible? If not, we will always be acting in a <i>post hoc</i> fashion <Col N="119"/>and the damage will be done before we know about it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand these are spot checks by definition. Will the Minister insist that dairy products and meat are measured, as well as airborne dioxins? This is the food we consume and this is where the dioxin is concentrated. Will she insist on such testing? I understand these tests will target airborne dioxins but this is of no help to preserving the good name of our food industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>These matters are before the courts. The decisions were made on the prerequisite that certain measures would be taken and it is for this reason my answer was conditional. These arrangements will prove satisfactory if certain measures are implemented. The EPA and the FSAI must be satisfied that these matters are dealt with.</P>
        <P>Deputy Sargent is correct in stating that these are spot checks. The monitoring is well beyond the EU standard and there is no reason this should not be so. The Office of Environmental Enforcement goes beyond the independence of the EPA and the FSAI. Discussions between the EPA and the FSAI regarding bio-monitoring, to which Deputy Sargent referred, and the production of milk, a sensitive indicator of foodstuffs, as well as tissue and animals likely to be exposed to any possible emissions. These concerns are being taken into consideration.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Agriculture and Food</askee>
        <Quest>the steps she will take to facilitate the live export of lambs to the UK and France; if she will address the holding period restriction; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
        <QRef>[37710/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always prepared to facilitate trade in live sheep, which is subject to EU rules governing intra-community trade. Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of Council Directive 91/68/EEC as amended, as regards reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats.</P>
        <P>These controls provide as a minimum requirement that breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export and that no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding in the 21 days prior to export.</P>
        <P>Slaughter sheep must also be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export and are also subject to a standstill period of 21 days prior to dispatch during which no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding of origin.</P>
        <P>These controls were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 and came into effect on 1 July 2004. I was aware that <Col N="120"/>there were certain difficulties with these certification requirements because the information in respect of which the official veterinarian was being required to certify could only be truly known to the farmer. Accordingly, my Department raised the matter with the European Commission in an effort to arrive at a certification procedure that best meets the concerns of farmers and exporters while, at the same time, protecting animal health. I am pleased that, in response to our approach, the European Commission submitted proposals to amend these certification requirements to allow the official veterinarian to issue certification based on a written declaration by the farmer or on an examination of the flock register and movement documents. The proposals providing for these new arrangements were agreed to unanimously by the standing committee on the food chain and animal health on 11 November 2005 and will apply from 15 February 2006. I am confident they will resolve most of the outstanding difficulties in relation to certification of exports of sheep to France and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>While I am happy to facilitate live sheep exports in any way possible, securing outlets and the supply and availability of transport for the carriage of livestock is a commercial matter and does not come within the remit of my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know how I am going to work that one out, but I will take it as being a positive response. Perhaps, rather than reading the prepared response, the Minister of State would explain, in plain English, what that means from February of next year.</P>
        <P>In the context of the import and export of sheep, a major issue that has arisen is that of having an all-Ireland animal health regime so that there would not be the possibility of sheep coming from the United Kingdom, via Northern Ireland, into the Republic. This is a genuine concern of farmers. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation in that regard and to give assurances that there are no sheep coming from Wales and Scotland, being re-branded as Northern Irish sheep and then making their way across the Border. There seems to be an enormous number of sheep north of the Border.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>In simple language, the Minister and I had a number of meetings with the IFA, sheep exporters and others, who pointed out the difficulties in respect of the residency and standstill requirements, which the veterinarian had to sign off on. Now the veterinarian will not have to sign off and the declaration of the farmer involved will be acceptable. The Commission has accepted that, it has gone before the standing committee and will apply from 15 February 2006. The exporters and farm organisations seem to be reasonably happy with that.</P><Col N="121"/>
        <P>In terms of figures, 35,000 sheep were exported in 2003, 58,000 in 2004 and to date this year, the figure is 88,000. Our officials are working on the issue of the all-Ireland agreement, which has proved reasonably difficult. However, we are continuing to try to bring about an arrangement where we will have an all-Ireland agreement in place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the discussions on the all-Ireland agreement, does the Minister of State believe the animal remedies regime in this country will cause difficulties and prevent agreement?</P>

	<P>No.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The strategic role of ICT in business development has been identified in the national e-business strategy launched by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in December 2004.</P>
        <P>Within this overall framework, the development agencies charged with promoting the growth of industry in general, and the agri-food industry in particular, are committed to optimising the potential of ICT in working with companies and in assisting the growth of strong and sustainable business.</P>
        <P>Food companies were among those to benefit from earlier initiatives such as the e-business acceleration fund initiative launched by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in May 2000 and the e-BIT initiative launched in May 2003. Enterprise Ireland is committed to mainstreaming e-business among its company base and this includes embedding ICT management skills in SMEs, building awareness of the impact of new technologies on businesses and promoting the use of ICT as a marketing and sales channel. In 2006 the e-business unit in Enterprise Ireland will organise a series of events on growing competitiveness through e-business and on-line marketing and e-marketplaces to raise awareness about e-marketplaces, provide advice on promoting companies&rsquo; on-line presence internationally and guidance on electronic trading.</P>
        <P>With regard to food and drinks companies specifically, Bord Bia has launched an electronic portal to provide market intelligence and advice. The portal already has 690 members, which is not far short of the total number of food and drinks companies manufacturing in Ireland, and is currently recording some 6,800 visits and 57,000 <Col N="122"/>pages viewed per annum. Bord Bia&rsquo;s website includes, among other publications, a guide to farmers&rsquo; markets which can be easily downloaded and updated to promote this growing alternative route to market.</P>
        <P>My Department and Teagasc have also been to the fore in providing e-services and e-payments to food producers, processors and exporters and in extending the reach and quality of those services to encourage the sustainable growth of the very important indigenous food and drinks sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for her reply and welcome the innovation indicated therein. However, once again I will dare to quote from the report, Rural Ireland 2025: Foresight Perspectives, whose eminent authors from the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, University College Dublin and Teagasc cannot be dismissed lightly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a good Roscommon man involved in that publication.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>The authors state, &ldquo;Access to broadband connection to the &lsquo;information highway&rsquo; is more restricted in Ireland with only half of the country&rsquo;s telephone lines being capable of giving access&rdquo;. In summary, they state:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland&rsquo;s place in the &lsquo;knowledge economy&rsquo; stakes indicates serious weaknesses. This is especially bad news for rural Ireland were the future actually turn out to be like this &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; scenario.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is absolutely critical that every effort is made by the Department of Agriculture and Food and other relevant Departments to ensure Ireland is a keen competitor. Clearly, we are now in a global economy and we will be left behind if we are not able to compete in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that in terms of infrastructure, it is not necessarily only what we can physically see that is important and in that context, the issue of broadband availability is relevant. This is particularly so with regard to the ability of small and artisan businesses to sell goods and services on-line.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not wholeheartedly agree with some of the forecasts in the report. I see them as depicting a doomsday scenario and I do not see the situation in that light at all. I agree that the roll-out of the broadband programme by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, will support small businesses and enterprises greatly. An enormous amount of money is being invested under that programme &mdash; I do not have the exact figures with me but they can be made available by way of other parliamentary questions &mdash; and I will be doing everything I can to drive and support the new technologies coming on stream <Col N="123"/>within agriculture. Information technology and the knowledge economy do not only apply to particular types of education or industry, they are also very much a part of agriculture in terms of research, development and education within agriculture and support mechanisms for our food and drink industry.</P>
        <P>Much work has been done on this initiative and work will continue on that, as well as on the support mechanisms and new methodologies of linking with our farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the aforementioned report and given what has happened in the sugar, pig and poultry industries recently, we could reach the authors&rsquo; prediction on the number of farmers in Ireland in 2025 very soon.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to the artisan food companies. The Internet certainly is a potential vehicle for them but there must be an overall structure provided by Bord Bia so that they are not scattered, willy-nilly, all over the Internet. We must develop a co-ordinated approach to Internet sales. Has the Minister taken any steps in that regard?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The level of flexibility in dealing with the Department of Agriculture and Food is great for those who have access to the Internet. The Department must be complimented in that regard. However, many people will never be able to avail of it. Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources about making that technology available via the local post office network for the many people who neither have Internet access nor the skills to access the facilities made available by the Department?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I refute the Deputy&rsquo;s political innuendo. The support for agriculture from the Government and, in particular, my team has been second to none. It is high time we took the scaremongering out of what are very serious issues arising from the nitrates directive. Instead of issuing press releases we need to work with the sector to ensure it is viable. I have demonstrated my commitment with huge investment in farm waste management and huge investment in alternatives, &euro;4 million having been made available this year. Above all I, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, will pursue that vigorously.</P>

I am delighted at the interest of the farming community in Internet access to their schemes, such as the CMMS database, and the use of mobile telephones. It augurs <Col N="124"/>well but we will still have to provide both schemes, as the Deputy will appreciate, given the part of the country from which he comes.

	<P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme was formally submitted to the European Commission in July and regulations giving legal effect to it are being finalised following a consultation process.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we take that as read?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I am listening to the answer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot take it as read. I am aware of concerns that have been expressed about the impact on the future of the pig and poultry sectors. Many farmers will have to adapt to the requirements of the nitrates directive and there will certainly be implications for pig and poultry farmers in particular because most of them do not have enough land of their own to spread the manure they produce. I am satisfied, however, that the great majority of these operators will be able to adapt successfully. To the extent that they may need additional waste storage, I have put proposals to the European Commission under which pig and poultry farmers will be eligible for the first time for grants under the farm waste management scheme. Grants of up to 70% will be available. I am also proposing grant aid for specialised equipment with specific environmental advantages, such as decanter centrifuge systems and dry feeding systems for pigs.</P>
        <P>As far as spreadlands are concerned, I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers in particular to continue to have access to enough land to spread slurry. I have asked Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate to other farmers the nutrient value of pig slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. I will be urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms and I will be seeking to ensure that the record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary. I want to get rid of the mistaken idea that farmers who take in pig or poultry manure are more likely <Col N="125"/>to fall foul of various rules and regulations than those who use chemical fertiliser.</P>
        <P>There is much that farmers can do to help one another, and I call on farm organisations to play their part by substituting imported organic fertilisers such as pig slurry. It is in the interests of other farming sectors that provide feed for pigs, such as the tillage sector, to assist the intensive pig producers by considering the use of manure on their crops. Pig producers also need to be proactive in identifying and encouraging suitable recipients to take and utilise their manure. By our combined efforts I believe we can all ensure the continuation of a viable pig and poultry sector.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue has been partly dealt with but I will ask further questions. The Minister says that a certain amount has already taken place, such as 30,000 farmers having invested heavily in pollution control and a number in slurry storage, which is good. I use pigeon manure in my garden so I know how good it is when used in the right amounts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>That will solve the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>In Kilkenny a number of farmers are working together in biogas production, which has led to a much reduced problem with the land-spreading of slurry. It is not just about storage or land-spread but innovating and creating a useful by-product at the same time. Does the Minister have anything more to offer, perhaps in conjunction with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, so that an interdepartmental package can be put together to overcome the problem of complying with the nitrates directive, given that we are over 12 years behind the rest of Europe in that regard? I appreciate there is friction in the Minister&rsquo;s party on the implementation of the directive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is correct that we have studied innovative ways to deal with the issue. It should not necessarily be termed &ldquo;Waste&rdquo; but that is the official EU term.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fertiliser.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an organic fertiliser that can be used for other purposes. That is why three weeks I ago I sought ten projects for the Department, for which I have provided &euro;4 million this year. It may be necessary to do something beyond that and I am actively working with both of my colleagues on that matter.</P>
        <P>The seriousness of the matter is such that I have consulted many eminent people, for example, from the University of Limerick, and have accepted suggestions for the poultry sector and for cross-Border solutions to the issue. I intend to ensure there is no adverse effect on <Col N="126"/>farmers from the nitrates directive, though alternatives must be used. In many other countries farming methods are different and that creates a difficulty for us. In the roll-out of the directive and in signing off statutory instruments I will continue to further evaluate the situation and examine further avenues available to me to support them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am certainly not one to indulge in scaremongering because I live in a community where reality is quickly dawning on the people concerned. Will the Minister assure us there will be a common-sense approach to managing the transitional period because switching to chemical fertiliser involves major changes for farmers? Many farmers say that after 1 February they will not take slurry or manure.</P>
        <P>We have a serious cross-Border problem in that much poultry manure comes south to displace our poultry manure in mushroom units. The number of planning permissions granted has been increased for poultry production in Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P>A senior official at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government told us on the record of the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food that he was not aware of the problem of poultry and pig farmers. I cannot understand where he has been in recent years. For a man negotiating in Brussels on our behalf to make that statement on the record at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food scares me. If the Minister thinks press releases from this side of the House are causing problems she need look no further than Department officials who still do not seem to understand how serious the position is for producers of pigs and poultry as well as extensive dairy production.</P>

        <P>We are also dealing with others I have mentioned, such as grant aid for decanters. That will run in tandem with the alternatives and research that will address this matter, the nutrient content of feed and possible reductions.</P>
        <P>We have been dealing with this for some time and it is my intention to deal with it to the best of my ability. People are starting to lose their reason on this issue and are putting pressure on Deputies on all sides, saying this will be a dooms<Col N="127"/>day scenario.

        <Quest>when she intends to introduce new grant rates provided to farmers under the control of farmyard pollution scheme in view of the increasing cost of steel and the demands that will be placed on farmers due to the nitrates directive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>To assist farmers to meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme, I have announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU state aid approval has been sought. I hope that early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming so that the revised scheme can be introduced next January. Negotiations are taking place with the European Commission on the clearance of the scheme and I hope it will be up and running in early January.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we get an assurance that those with fewer than 20 livestock units will be included in this and that will it be in force from 1 January? We have limited time to get this into place and the cost of steel is an issue. The Minister said she has made a large amount of money available. Comparing what is available now with what was available ten years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>At that time &euro;97 million was paid out but only &euro;45 million will be paid out this year. Will the Minister guarantee that the funds needed will be provided so housing and storage can be erected this year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten"><NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
	<P>Will those availing of the present scheme be able to avail of the new scheme if they have not begun construction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but they will have to withdraw their original application if they have not begun work.</P>
        <P>In answer to Deputy Crawford, the decision rests with the Commission. Following the dis<Col N="128"/>cussions for the protocol on direct payment to farmers, the Department&rsquo;s standard costings will be revised at the beginning of each year so any increase in the cost of steel and other inputs will be taken into account in the introduction of the revised standard costings in January 2006. Steel costings will be taken into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Department make extra funding available if there is a realistic uptake of this? It is a serious problem and when pigs and poultry are included, there should be major demand and we do not want it to fall short.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the capital programme there will be adequate funding for 2006. If extra money is required we will make that available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OlwynEnrightFG"><NameTxt>Ms Enright</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget in this empty House. I will deal with some areas from a local perspective and some from a national perspective.</P>
      <P>Transport 21 was emphasised in yesterday&rsquo;s budget, with more detail revealed on it. As I said when the plan was announced, while I support the gist of it, I am concerned that we will not see much action on it. I represent Laoighis-Offaly and live in County Offaly which has been all but ignored in Transport 21. We will benefit in a small way from the N6 Galway to Dublin road but a bypass for Tullamore has been ignored again. There was a brief reference to bypasses in the budget but no specific detail on which projects will be prioritised. I would like to see a start date for the Tullamore bypass. The monitoring committee reported recently to the Midland Regional Authority, stating clearly that there is no start date for the bypass and that it is to be determined within a ten-year plan. It was not clear what plan it was referring to because it is not part of Transport 21.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to raise the Edenderry to Enfield road any other way than when discussing the budget. It comes off the N6 at Enfield and continues for 18 km until it reaches Edenderry, which is the fastest growing town in County Offaly. That road is a series of potholes. Funding had been provided for it but it was never spent. It is a matter to be decided between local authorities but in this instance the only local authority involved is Kildare County Council. There should be a mechanism for roads that service a county other than the county it crosses. No body is responsible if a local authority will not invest funding. This road is crucial to the future of Offaly. The Enfield bypass is improving but that is not much comfort for those who have to turn off it because they are not going to Galway.</P><Col N="130"/>
      <P>These issues should be prioritised when planning for Transport 21. I am disappointed that the budget yesterday did not mention the Tullamore bypass. I did not expect it to mention the Edenderry to Enfield road but both issues are vital for County Offaly and must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s announcement on the third and fourth level sectors. It is important for the future of the State that we develop our third level sector better than has been the case to date. It is, however, making up for a lack of investment in recent years. We have treated the PRTLI programme and investment in science and technology at third level in a stop-go fashion. Thankfully, the matter has been addressed in the past two budgets but if foreigners are to be encouraged to attend third level in Ireland and if we want to attract researchers while encouraging our own to remain in the field, a definite funding stream must be provided. Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement was positive and I hope the Minister will ensure people compete for funding in this field. However, the proposal is weak in detail and perhaps the Minister for Education and Science will provide more information in the coming days. I would like to know what the Government intends to do to ensure this proposal is implemented.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance referred to changes and improvements in universities, wider collaboration and drawing on collective strength, but it must be acknowledged that the third and fourth level sectors do not have the same critical mass as the US, in particular. The third level population in Ireland is small compared to individual universities in the US. Ireland is also competing globally and I hope the proposal will allow us to better compete.</P>
      <P>I was extremely disappointed that the further education sector was completely ignored in the Estimates and the budget. As a man who was on the TUI protest outside the House yesterday wondered, what is it about the sector that the Government will not invest in it? It is the most responsive sector, given its ability to react to changes locally. When a new company is set up in a community, the further education college puts on courses quickly to satisfy need. A significant proportion of adults returning to education go through the further education sector and every county has a college of further education.</P>
      <P>The McIver report made a number of good recommendations, which were bought into by all the stakeholders, but they have not been progressed over the past two or three years. The Minister for Education and Science stated earlier that she cannot do everything in one go. However, while she may have been in office for only 18 months, the Government parties have been in power for almost nine years and she cannot refer to anything being done in one go. The Government needs to address this issue. More people from disadvantaged backgrounds are entering the third level sector but the further <Col N="131"/>education sector has been failed over recent years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome that, at last, something is happening in regard to child care. I am surprised the Government parties decided on a cut-off point of six years, especially given that it is their ninth year in office. Children who were born in their first four years in office will not benefit from the scheme and it is a pity the Government chose this cut-off point. I am glad the Government has finally woken up and decided to do something in this area. However, while child care is vital, I would like the Government to place greater emphasis on the establishment of pre-school facilities. Cr&egrave;ches are only one part of the equation and I would prefer if children aged three or four, who have not commenced primary school, went into pre-school education as distinct from attending a cr&egrave;che or child minder. Unfortunately, that option is not available in many parts of the State.</P>
      <P>Pre-school facilities were provided in disadvantaged areas following an initiative implemented a number of years ago but the initiative was not rolled out nationwide. Only 30 or 40 schools have the facilities. However, this sector has been ignored for years and it will take a long time to expand these facilities. The Government needs to address this now and the Minister for Finance needs to develop his child care proposals in the coming months by placing greater emphasis on the provision of appropriate pre-school education.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The decentralisation programme was announced in the Budget Statement two years ago. I would like more commitment and answers on the where, when and how of the programme. Five towns in my constituency expect to benefit. Civil servants have transferred to Portlaoise and Tullamore, which I welcome, but there are negative consequences for towns such as my home town of Birr when national newspapers carry reports that civil servants do not want to move there because they do not think the town has sufficient school and child care places. That results in a bad image of a good town. The town has excellent education facilities and I undertook all my schooling there. Birr also has excellent arts and sports facilities but they are not being promoted in the decentralisation programme. The announcement of the programme has had a negative impact.</P>
      <P>The Government missed a significant opportunity yesterday to reintroduce roll-over relief for farmers. It is extremely unfair that a farmer whose land is compulsorily purchased by the State for the building of a road must pay 20% capital gains tax and if he wants to replace this land, he must also pay 9% stamp duty. He must pay 29% tax on a sale he does not want to undertake and that is extremely wrong. There was little point in the Government negotiating a good deal a number of years ago with the IFA only to come <Col N="132"/>along a year later to wipe it out. Nobody wants to give up his land for a road project and this is compounded by having to pay 29% tax. Farmers should be allowed to invest in replacement land without having to pay tax on both transactions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley"><NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. There was a great air of expectation and anticipation prior to the budget. People expected a great deal because there was never as much in the coffers. As our spokesperson, Deputy Bruton, said yesterday, the Government is in receipt of &euro;1 billion a week from the taxpayer and Exchequer receipts have increased under every heading. People expected something new and innovative in yesterday&rsquo;s budget. However, considering it in the cold light of day, the most charitable adjective to describe it is mediocre. A number of commentators said it was dull while others said it was a damp squib and was not innovative. I concur with these descriptions because the Minister had an opportunity to do something new but he allocated money here and there where he felt there was a demand for it.</P>
      <P>At long last, the Government has recognised that child care had been badly neglected and something had to be done. It is a small step in the right direction but the Government admitted it will take five years to complete its plan. The elderly have also been neglected and the scandal of illegal nursing home charges went on for years. The patients and their relatives are entitled to compensation worth &euro;1 billion and it is disappointing it has taken so long to do anything about that problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the significant increases in social welfare payments, which are three or four times the rate of inflation. However, when one considers the stealth taxes introduced by the Government and other expenses that must be paid by the elderly and other recipients, they will not be much better off this time next year. The social welfare system throws up a number of anomalies. If one is in receipt of a short-term benefit such as unemployment benefit and then takes up a community employment scheme, one is not entitled to other benefits such as free fuel and so on, but if one is in receipt of unemployment assistance, one qualifies. There is little difference between a short-term and a long-term payment. The same rate is paid and it is unfair that these people do not receive the ancillary benefits.</P>
      <P>Being parochial, I ask the Minister what is in the budget for the people of Donegal. Two years ago, the then Minister for Finance announced the decentralisation programme and Donegal was promised 400 jobs. These Civil Service, permanent jobs are badly needed and they are not like the jobs we have had in some of the traditional industries which have been relocated to Europe, Central America, Asia and elsewhere. It is very disappointing that these jobs will not be <Col N="133"/>decentralised to County Donegal until 2010 at the earliest. They were to have been decentralised by 2006 but it will be 2010 before accommodation is available to transfer these civil servants to County Donegal, if it ever happens.</P>
      <P>Apart from unemployment, one of the biggest problems we face is the inadequacies of the health service in the county. I was disappointed there was no recognition of these inadequacies in yesterday&rsquo;s budget. Letterkenny General Hospital needs 60 or 70 additional beds. As I speak, there are people on trolleys in that hospital. Each day there are ten, 17 or 24 people on trolleys. These numbers are available on a daily basis. I was very disappointed little was said in yesterday&rsquo;s budget speech about making funds available to address this long running difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department has a pivotal role to play in ensuring the fruits of our economic growth benefit the most vulnerable and that those who need support and encouragement get it. I have repeatedly stressed that as a country we can only really be proud of our booming economy and vibrant, modern country when it reaches down and lifts those who, for whatever reason, have been left behind or marginalised. For that reason, I am determined that the substantial resources available to my Department will be targeted at delivering a 21st century welfare service to the people.</P>
      <P>It must be a service that responds in a way that is about more than allowances and benefits, important and all as those welfare and financial lifelines are to hundreds of thousands of citizens. It must be a service that blends recognition, compassion and support with encouragement, incentives and activation so as to ensure that the potential and contribution of each person is not overlooked or neglected by our system.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It was with this philosophy and direction in mind that I approached this budget with a number of key priorities in mind. I wanted to continue to improve the position of our older people and to recognise their valuable contribution to this country. They deserve to have a decent income that allows them to live out their later years with dignity and security without the threat of poverty or isolation. I wanted to take a decisive step towards the elimination of poverty and especially to intensify the confronting of the unacceptable blight of child poverty. I wanted budget 2006 to assist in the development of a programme of supports and opportunities for <Col N="134"/>those parenting alone who, with their children, are in danger of falling into a cycle of deprivation and marginalisation. I wanted to improve income supports to, and recognition of, carers who perform a valued and valuable service for the whole of society. I wanted to ensure this budget reflected and underpinned with financial support, the evolving new social agenda I am pursuing and that has at its core a social welfare support system that is active instead of passive and that assists people to live with dignity and enables them to make a valuable contribution towards society. This budget has delivered on these objectives and by any standard, it is ground breaking. The facts speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>The budget delivers the largest ever spend on social welfare of &euro;1.12 billion. Total expenditure in 2006 will reach &euro;13.5 billion. That is double what was spent in 2000 and will benefit 1.5 million people. Some &euro;800 million of this is being spent in substantial increases in allowances, pensions and entitlements and a further &euro;300 million specifically for a range of social policy reform measures. Social welfare payments have been increased by almost four times the expected rate of inflation. The lowest rates of social welfare have been increased by an unprecedented &euro;17 per week to a new level of &euro;165.80, with proportionate increases in the qualified adult allowance. Means tested old age pensions have been increased by &euro;16 per week to &euro;182 and contributory pensions by &euro;14 to over &euro;193 per week. A wide-ranging reform programme will boost the entitlements of older people, alleviate poverty, support activation and recognise carers. Fuel allowances are being increased by &euro;5 per week as part of a major fuel poverty relief package costing over &euro;42 million. Carers allowances are being increased by over &euro;26 per week so that the top rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance will now stand at &euro;200 per week. A range of measures costing &euro;28 million will promote activation by improving income disregards and tapers for people with disabilities and many others. Maternity benefit is being increased to 80% of reckonable weekly earnings.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few points on the main features of the budget from my Department&rsquo;s point of view. The needs of older people have been a priority for this Government. We have delivered record increases in pensions since taking office. Pensions have increased by over 80% since 1997 which is well ahead of the increase in the consumer price index and gross earnings over the same period. The further increases in pensions announced in this budget reaffirm our commitment to providing decent social welfare pensions for people.</P>
      <P>The increase of &euro;17 per week to the lowest social welfare rates, and to which I referred earlier, will apply to a wide range of schemes, including those paid to widows under 66 years of age, the unemployed, people unable to work due to disability or illness and lone parents. In framing these proposals, I was especially mindful of the <Col N="135"/>fact many in these groups are at risk of consistent poverty and of the target in the programme for Government and Sustaining Progress to achieve a rate of &euro;150 per week in 2002 terms by 2007 for the lowest social welfare rates. With the lowest rate at over &euro;165 per week, we are now on course to complete that commitment in next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>Over the past year I, with the support of my Government colleagues, have been laying out a strong new social reform agenda and major funding of more than &euro;300 million is being made available to underpin and give tangible effect to these important and necessary reforms. The reforms, while protecting those who are disadvantaged among us, must also strive, as I have said repeatedly, to get behind the welfare payments and tackle the social issues involved. It is a well established fact that the best route out of poverty is through employment. That is why, through these reforms, I want to create the changes and opportunities that will bring people from welfare dependency to financial independence by providing the stepping stones to a better standard of living and income.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have identified child poverty as one of the Government&rsquo;s key challenges. National and international research confirms that children who grow up in disadvantaged households are more likely to do poorly at school, to struggle to find a job and to be unemployed, sick or disabled when they become adults, precipitating an inter-generational cycle of disadvantage and deprivation. The long-term cost of poverty in childhood for individual children, their families and communities and indeed for society at large, demands that we address this issue as a priority. Measures to address child poverty cannot be progressed in isolation from other aspects of our income support arrangements. In the context of budget 2006, I had a number of specific objectives in this regard. Specifically, I wanted to substantially increase total family income by giving unprecedented levels of increase to all the basic social welfare rates. I wanted to reform our current income support arrangements to maximise the benefits of work for low-income households. I wanted to meet the remaining Government commitments in relation to child benefit, to target additional resources at those most in need of additional support through those instruments that could be implemented immediately and to ensure these specific measures are congruent with a longer-term Government strategy on child income support. More than &euro;100 million is being invested in increases that lift the child benefit payment rates to &euro;150 for the first two children and &euro;185 for the third and each subsequent child. The entitlement is paid to more than 540,000 families in respect of more than 1 million children.</P>
      <P>With these new increases the Government has now fully honoured its commitment on child benefit. When taken together with the Govern<Col N="136"/>ment&rsquo;s child care package announced yesterday, this represents a significant contribution to the alleviation of child poverty and to support for children. All families with children of less than six years will benefit from the new child care payment. This will bring the total annual cash support, including child support to at least &euro;2,800 per annum per child.</P>
      <P>The family income supplement has an increasingly important role to play when it comes to practical, targeted and concentrated measures to tackle poverty. That is why I made major changes to the support scheme in yesterday&rsquo;s budget, making it particularly beneficial to larger families, and increased funding by a further &euro;25 million. FIS is paid to parents in low income employment with the objective of directing more resources to larger families. Under the changes that are now being introduced, FIS payments will make further significant contributions to incomes in thousands of low income homes.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As a result of the improvements, it is estimated that more than 5,000 additional families will become eligible for the payment next year. Depending on the size of the family, weekly increases in FIS will range from more than &euro;11 to &euro;169 a week. For example, for a family with four children its weekly FIS payment could rise by &euro;64.80 a week while FIS for a family with six children could rise by nearly &euro;117 a week. FIS can contribute significantly to boosting child support incomes. For example, a family with earnings from employment of &euro;20,000 with two children of less than six years would qualify for &euro;3,900 in FIS annually. When one adds to that the child care payment of &euro;2000 and &euro;3,600 in child benefit this family would have an annual tax free child welfare income support of &euro;9,500 a year. For a family on the same income of &euro;20,000 but with four children, two of them aged less than six years, the annual FIS support would amount to &euro;7,644, giving the family a total child support package of &euro;17,684 a year. On an income of &euro;30,000, the same family would still qualify for total child support income of &euro;11,694 annually.</P>
      <P>Another important support for thousands of families on low incomes is the back to school clothing and footwear payment. This payment is being substantially increased by &euro;40 per child and entitlement to it is being further extended. I am also making a further &euro;2 million available to the school meals programme which makes a valuable contribution to the quality of life and educational opportunities of children in low income families. More than &euro;10 million is now earmarked for the various school meals initiatives next year. These measures are the first steps in a concerted programme of action for the next few years aimed at vastly improving our system of child income support.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies will be aware that in 2005 the National Economic and Social Council has spent considerable time and effort analysing the issues and developing proposals in regard to child <Col N="137"/>income support. It has been examining, in particular, the possibility of merging FIS and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support, which would avoid the disincentives inherent in child dependant allowance. That report will set out the broad principles of such a payment rather than a detailed operational blueprint. My priorities for 2006 will include how best we can pursue the proposals arising from the report. In the meantime, my budget package addresses these broad principles by adjusting the FIS income thresholds in a way which makes a bigger contribution toward larger families than previously. This approach is a key feature of previous proposals for a second tier child income support payment.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment specifically on lone parent families. Only about half of all lone parents are in paid jobs. This is one of the lowest participation rates in the OECD. Particularly worrying is the fact that more than 40% of one-parent families are categorised as at risk of poverty at a time when Ireland is continuing to enjoy strong economic growth. My Department provides income support to about 80,000 lone parents through the one-parent family payment at a total cost this year of more than &euro;760 million. I have previously expressed concern about this situation. As colleagues will know, I have initiated a major review of the one-parent family payment to assess how best we can support lone parents in their efforts to improve their own lives and those of their children. That review is now being finalised and I will bring it to Government in January next with a view to publication and wide consultation. I very much look forward to hearing the views of the House, lone parent representative groups and others on these proposals.</P>
      <P>In the normal course of events I would do nothing to the structure of the payment until the review is published and debated, but I have decided not to delay action on one important aspect of the payment. As many in this House may know, there has been no change in the income limits applying to the one-parent family payment since the scheme was introduced in 1997. I have said publicly on many occasions that I want to give lone parents an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings without raising their fears about losing their entitlement to the payment, which I know from speaking to many lone parents, represents their financial security. In recognition of this I am pleased, therefore, to increase the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment from &euro;293 to &euro;375 per week. This fairly substantial increase will encourage further employment and help to ensure a measure of financial security. Lone parents working more than 19 hours per week can also claim the family income supplement, of which I spoke earlier. While earnings thresholds have a major role to play, other important factors also affect the ability of lone parents to take up employment and the nature of that employment. These have <Col N="138"/>been identified in the Government&rsquo;s discussion document which I will launch in the new year.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate juncture to mention that I am providing initial funding in the budget to the Family Support Agency and the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, so that they can further develop the services they provide to vulnerable families. The additional funding of &euro;3 million to the Family Support Agency will enable the establishment of 12 new family resource centres around the country and increase the level of grant assistance the agency provides to marriage and family counselling agencies, among other initiatives. Since its inception 13 years ago, the MABS has developed into a nationwide network providing advice and support to people who find themselves at the end of their tether, coping with debt and the challenge of making ends meet. It is an excellent service and I am keen to put it on a sure legislative footing for the future. I am currently consulting widely with various stakeholders within MABS and I hope to be in a position to move forward with a money advice and budgeting services Bill next year. The additional funding I am providing for the service includes provision for its further development as well as specific funding for the establishment of a national helpline.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on the publication of the Estimates, older people are a priority for my social reform agenda. We have a booming economy and it is only right that the people who laid the foundation for our current prosperity should be able to enjoy the fruits of the tremendous strides this country has made in the past decade or so. This budget makes provision for a number of important measures designed to target resources at particular groups of older people. In considering these measures I was anxious to target those who are at the greatest risk of poverty, to allow people to supplement their social welfare pension through employment, and to simplify the system of income support for older people who do not receive contributory pensions. In this regard, people aged 66 and over can be in receipt of six different non-contributory schemes depending on individual circumstances and each scheme has its own individual means test. This is an anachronism and has no place in a modern social protection system. Accordingly, I propose to combine all non-contributory payments for people over 66 years of age, other than carer&rsquo;s allowance, into one standard enhanced non-contributory pension scheme with a greatly improved means test. I am increasing the amount of weekly means disregard from &euro;7.60 to &euro;20 per week for this standard pension. I am also providing a special earnings disregard of &euro;100 per week. I regard the latter measure as a first step of a process to provide incentives to older people to continue in employment. It is estimated that almost 34,000 people will benefit from these changes at a cost of &euro;20 million.</P><Col N="139"/>
      <P>When the standard pension is introduced next September, individual pensioners, currently on reduced rates of payment because of their means, will be better off by up to &euro;12.50 per week and up to &euro;20.80 where a qualified adult allowance is payable. I am also pleased to tell the House that under the new arrangements, a single pensioner with no other means will be able to have up to &euro;35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure will be doubled to &euro;70,000 in the case of a couple.</P>
      <P>Research shows that the incomes of pensioners decline with age and that pensioners have a higher risk of poverty as they grow older. Accordingly, it is appropriate that we should target additional resources at this group and I have, therefore, increased the additional allowance paid to those over 80 years of age by &euro;3.60 to &euro;10 per week. This measure will benefit over 100,000 pensioners including 33,000 receiving widow&rsquo;s and widower&rsquo;s pensions.</P>
      <P>When added to the increases in the basic pension which I announced earlier, a contributory pensioner over 80 years of age will now have a pension of &euro;203.30 per week, while pensioner couples will receive additional increases ranging from &euro;9.30 to &euro;10.80 per week. By any standards, these are good increases and a further demonstration of our commitment to the elderly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the House will be aware, a key part of our overall pensions strategy is an increase in occupational and private pensions coverage. I have received a comprehensive report from the Pensions Board on the current situation and the measures we might take in the future. That report is before the Cabinet for consideration and should be published shortly.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to the budget, I received many representations from colleagues and representative organisations seeking an increase in the level of allowance paid under the national fuel scheme. The issue of fuel poverty is an emotive one, touching on one of the most fundamental human needs. At present, a means tested allowance of &euro;9 is paid to recipients of long-term social welfare payments for 29 weeks of the year. I tend to the view that it is better to channel Exchequer resources into increasing basic social welfare rates rather than diluting the impact by diverting resources into allowances which, by definition, are payable to a smaller number of people. However, on this occasion I was influenced by the fact that the allowance has not been increased since 2002 and that it is targeted at the most vulnerable households, including the elderly, those who are ill or with disabilities and households with young children. Accordingly, I am pleased to be able to increase the allowance to &euro;5 a week.</P>
      <P>I am also availing of the opportunity to remove the current anomaly whereby residents in some local authority flat complexes with communal heating systems are ineligible for the fuel allowance. Such residents will now be able to qualify <Col N="140"/>for the allowance if they meet the other conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I now turn to the topic of those who care for older people and people with disabilities in their homes. Over the past nine years, the Government has placed increasing emphasis on the role of community care in supporting the vast majority of people who wish to remain in their own homes. Earlier this year, the T&aacute;naiste and I established a working group on long-term care. We recently received a full report from the task force on that issue and will take proposals to Cabinet in the near future.</P>
      <P>This year will see the biggest ever increase in the rate of payment to carers. The carer&rsquo;s benefit will increase by &euro;17 to &euro;180.70. The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase by &euro;26.40, bringing it to &euro;180 per week for a carer under the age of 66. Significantly, the rate for carers over the age of 66 will increase by &euro;30, bringing it to &euro;200 per week and making it the single largest welfare entitlement, apart from the pensioners of over 80 years of age who I mentioned earlier. This represents increases of more than 17% for recipients of carers&rsquo; allowances and I hope it goes some way to acknowledge the great work they do.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are increasing the rate of the respite care grant from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,200 from next June. The number of hours which a person can work while still receiving carer&rsquo;s allowance, carer&rsquo;s benefit or respite care grant will increase from ten to 15 hours per week and the income disregards for the means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance will increase to &euro;290 for a single person and &euro;580 for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn up to &euro;32,925, while the carer receives the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance. I am extending the duration of the carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme to two years per care recipient from May 2006. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, proposes to extend the carer&rsquo;s leave scheme, which allows for the protection of the carer&rsquo;s employment rights for the duration of the caring period to two years.</P>
      <P>As part of my reform programme, I am delighted to be able to announce a number of further improvements to the means testing arrangements and the main employment support services in this budget, which are designed to ease the transition to work. I am introducing a tapered withdrawal rate for disability allowance and blind pension recipients who engage in rehabilitative employment or self-employment and have a weekly income over &euro;120 and under &euro;350, which will benefit approximately 2,600 people. The qualifying period for access to the self-employment strand of the back to work allowance will be reduced from three years to two years on the live register and in the qualifying period for the employee strand from five to two years. Furthermore, periods spent on supplementary welfare allowance and direct provision allowance will also count towards the calculation of the qualifying <Col N="141"/>period. A 50% tapered relief of withdrawal of earnings between &euro;60 and &euro;90 per week will be introduced for persons in receipt of rent and mortgage interest supplement. Many organisations and individuals have asked me to examine that issue.</P>
      <P>I will conclude at this stage, even though I have not commented on all the changes proposed in this budget. Full details are available in the budget fact sheet published by my Department. It is a generous and far-reaching budget which allocates a record breaking &euro;800 million on increases to social welfare payments and initiates a new social reform agenda, including funding for targeted initiatives that further recognise and reward carers, increases in incomes for the most vulnerable older people, specific measures to tackle child poverty issues, introduction of supports that further empower lone parents and the promotion of activation through back to work, training and education supports which enhance choices for welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to share my time with Deputies Broughan and O&rsquo;Shea.</P>
      <P>I intend to address issues relevant to my portfolio of agriculture and food. I was disturbed to find that the first line of the Minister for Agriculture and Food&rsquo;s budget press release reveals all that needs to be said about this Government&rsquo;s attitude to farmers, food consumers and producers. In that press release, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, stated that farmers and the wider rural community in Ireland will benefit significantly from the &ldquo;generous increases in social welfare payments&rdquo;. I had hoped that, instead of being on social welfare payments for the farming community, which is welcome and, in many cases, needed, the emphasis would have been on ways to promote, encourage and sustain agriculture. Recent reports indicate that, while farming is an important aspect of the economy, the industry will suffer in the future unless radical steps are taken to ensure its viability. Accordingly, I have concerns on the priority indicated by the inclusion of social welfare payments in the opening of the statement by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Aside from social welfare payment increases, the Minister trumpets improvements to the rental income tax exemption for leasing of farmland. Again, the question arises of how much these improvements mean to our farmers. She estimates it at &euro;2 million in a full year. Once again, this is reflective of the importance of agriculture today, as perceived by the Government.</P>
      <P>The second best thing the Minister can say of this year&rsquo;s budget is that Irish farmers, who feed us all, are entitled to a tax break of &euro;2 million a year. The Foresight report predicted that there would be only 10,000 full-time farmers by 2025. What the Minister should be doing is putting in place the provisions that will ensure that predictions do not come true. There are solutions proposed in that document and the Minister should <Col N="142"/>be putting the emphasis on implementing them and the other recommendations rather than arguing against them and resisting them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension of stamp duty relief for young trained farmers. The Minister said this will be worth about &euro;19 million to Irish farmers. I welcome too the higher maximum &ldquo;floating allowance&rdquo; permitted for necessary pollution control facilities but once again I am aghast that the Minister should boast that is worth &euro;1 million to Irish farmers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Before I get on to biofuels, I emphasise to this House that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has proudly announced that the budget will, apart from social welfare payments, be worth around &euro;24 million to Irish farmers. If that had been the amount of extra money in a budget in the 1950s provided to Irish farmers, we might have had some reason to be pleased, but these are not the 1950s. This is the 2006 budget and the Minister for Agriculture and Food is boasting that &euro;24 million is being given to Irish farmers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The year 2006 will be a time of unprecedented prosperity for most non-farming sectors of the economy but it will be a time of unprecedented pressures, financial and otherwise, being exerted upon Irish farmers. Next year will also be a time when certain parties will be absolutely determined to renege on the CAP reforms and do a deal in the context of the forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong which will mean that Irish farmers, whose backs are already against the wall, will be put under even more pressure than they are currently under. The Government&rsquo;s response to this is a miserable &euro;24 million.</P>
      <P>If the Minister really cared about Irish farmers, she would probably have taken a strong stance against what was being offered in this budget on behalf of the portfolio she represents. The future of Irish farming is in doubt, not least because of this Government&rsquo;s refusal to offer real and effective support to the sector. For example, the prospect of biofuels and bio-ethanol farming offers a tantalisingly practical solution to many of the problems faced by Irish agriculture and the environment, yet this budget offers increased incentives only to the 100% biofuel products. Such products would require expensive vehicle conversions but the Minister can boast of nothing to support biofuels which are blended into existing fuels and do not require engines to be converted.</P>
      <P>There is absolutely nothing in the budget for Irish food consumers or Irish food producers, or if there is, the Minister has been very silent and we have heard nothing about it. I have raised the issue of &ldquo;food deserts&rdquo; a number of times. It refers to people on low incomes, the elderly and the infirm, those who very often find it impossible to purchase healthy foods at a reasonable price. There are food deserts in our cities and in our countryside in which people are unable to travel to faraway supermarkets; food deserts in which pensioners who can only get to their local shops <Col N="143"/>are being prevented from eating nutritious and appropriate food. The Minister for Agriculture and Food can find nothing in this year&rsquo;s budget to boast about which will help solve this problem, and the abolition of the groceries order is something with which we must concern ourselves. We must wait and see what will replace it, but Combat Poverty and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have serious questions about the impact the abolition will have on the poorest and most vulnerable, and those furthest away from a cheap, reasonable and available source of nutritious food.</P>
      <P>Apart from the agricultural and food aspects of this budget which are of some concern, there are other aspects which trouble me and my constituents. Already, constituents have pointed out to me that the gains to be made by old age pensioners and those on low incomes will be offset by the increases in the new year when Dublin City Council rents will increase. We welcome the extra allowances, but any gains made by people in that area will be rapidly offset. Those people will scarcely have time to evaluate the significance of the increase.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The budget does nothing for the homeless in my constituency. It does not provide for any increase in social housing, nor does it increase the cap on the capital assistance scheme for housing. Earlier during this D&aacute;il term I was involved with homeless people trying to get back into third level education. As it turned out, they were able to get some funding, for which I am grateful, but it was a once-off payment given to them as a concession, and not written into the future. This is not what we want. This was a very unusual set of circumstances. I welcome the contribution and support given to those people but I would like assurances for the future that they do not have to go through the same worry which they did this year in order to access that third level college. At the best of times it is difficult for homeless people to get by. These people were particularly brave and enthusiastic enough to find their way into third level colleges. The idea that they then almost had to beg in order to access the meagre rent allowances and social welfare supports to keep them there is unacceptable. The last thing we need is for these people to be put in a situation where they have to drop out of the courses.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the reinstatement of the fuel allowance for old age pensioners who live in local authority-provided accommodation with communal heating. Deputies Quinn, Broughan, I and other Dublin representatives raised that issue before. As it happened, a very small number of people found themselves in this particular bind. With some unacceptable enthusiasm, these people were deprived of their fuel allowance. I am glad to see that allowance reinstated and I acknowledge that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has been generous in this respect. The reinstatement is very <Col N="144"/>welcome. My concern is that it was ever removed from those people, who come to depend on what is a very meagre allowance, and that they had to endure the trauma. I also welcome the increases in the contributory and non-contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>Turning again to matters which affect my constituents, Transport 21 was trumpeted with great acclaim, but there is a great big gap in the glitzy map which accompanies it, which I regret to say represents much of the Dublin South-Central area. This blank spot means our traffic jams will unfortunately persist beyond 2016.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed there is nothing in the budget with regard to educational disadvantage. I represent a constituency where there are some anomalous situations with regard to those who fall within the disadvantaged areas and who can access the benefits which go with the disadvantaged designation, and those who do not. For example, if one&rsquo;s school happens to be on a road which is not seen as disadvantaged, even though 80% of the pupils attending come from a disadvantaged area, the benefits and advantages are withheld. The Minister for Education and Science must look at this anomaly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The PLCs seem to have been totally ignored in the budget. I welcome the investment and support for the third level and fourth level, as proposed. I am a great supporter of the importance of research and development in our very high educational standards and attainments, and appreciate the benefit of best quality graduates emerging from this country. However, there are other people in an educational bank, so to speak, who are not in the academic side of education and who do not wish to be. They should not be made to believe the academic route is the only one to take. There are people with other aspirations and other qualities and they should be given other career options.</P>
      <P>My brief is agriculture and it is an area about which I am concerned. The budget is dismissive in regard to the major concerns that have been highlighted to my colleagues and me in recent months by the farming organisations and all those engaged in farming. Relatively little has been done for them in this budget.</P>

	<P>I am sorry there has been a mix-up. I am aware Deputy Ring has a long journey to the north west.</P>
      <P>After all the hype and promises, yesterday turned out to be a disappointing non-event. The Minister for Finance had more than &euro;50 billion at his disposal, a massive amount of money, but the result is a bland and essentially neutral budget. There was expectation in the media yesterday morning that there would be a major and fundamental initiative on child care at least, and perhaps some major new surprise development that would have given a personal stamp to the Department of Finance. As we quickly read through the budget as the Minister spoke, we realised that nothing much had occurred. It lacked flair and did nothing serious about the grave situation facing young and hard-working parents travelling up to 50 miles to work every day.</P>
      <P>The events of recent days have been overshadowed to a large extent. It is often said that the former Minister for Finance, Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, was a lucky punter who happened to be a lucky Minister for Finance for six and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Broughan still telling jokes in here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>In his six budgets, his &ldquo;book of budgets&rdquo; as he described them, he reshaped Ireland into a harsh, vicious, winner-takes-all society. That was his aim, as we now know. I hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, was not one of those present in those dark days, 20 years ago, when the Progressive Democrats conspiracy was being hatched in rooms around this city. Sadly, one of the key conspirators was Mr. McCreevy. He was a classic class warrior who believed in class war. He delivered the worst excesses of United States capitalism to this State over those six and a half years. It is unfortunate that we had to live through those budgets in what the media liked to call the era of &ldquo;good time Charlie&rdquo;. It was a great time for the plethora of wealthy developers, the auctioneering class, the racing industry and those engaged in all types of cute scams&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not realise Deputy Broughan had joined the Workers Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is aware that I have always been a member of the Labour Party.</P><Col N="146"/>
      <P>Such people reaped wonderful rewards from the era of &ldquo;good time Charlie&rdquo;. It is now clear, however, that the McCreevy luck has deserted Fianna F&aacute;il. Every time, for example, the Government has tried to shape the agenda in the past seven or eight months, going back to spring and early summer, it has generally been completely overtaken by nasty events. One only has to recall August, a time when the Government is usually able to control the agenda on a daily basis. Thanks to the brilliant forensic analysis of Eddie Hobbs, however, the Government completely lost control of the agenda. Mr. Hobbs pointed out the nature of the society Mr. McCreevy delivered in the course of those six and a half years.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the economic outlook. There are some frightening straws in the wind as the economic climate changes. It is not just that the energy picture is much more problematic and that some of the serious issues in energy and climate change will have to be addressed in the coming years. I advise the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, that this is not a laughing matter. One of the most significant straws in the wind is yesterday&rsquo;s development whereby the National Treasury Management Agency was given &euro;20 million for the task of buying our carbon credits. We now know that in coming years, we will face a grave and growing bill, perhaps up to &euro;100 million per year.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This issue was one of the responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in his previous Department. Because he and his successor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, did not address the issue, we face a situation next year where we know additional employment will fall, perhaps significantly. Net job increase is projected to drop by more than 20,000 jobs in comparison with 2005. This is a disturbing statistic given that we have been used to dramatic increases of 150% in the economy and 100% in the number of jobs.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most disturbing straw in the wind for the economy generally is the interest rise of 25 business points instigated by Jean-Claude Trichet and his colleagues in Frankfurt. This is a small change but one that will affect young couples and those paying mortgages and personal loans, in particular, in terms of the additional costs they must face next year. Those who are on the margins may find this the straw that breaks the camel&rsquo;s back. Neither the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, nor his successors will have control of monetary policy. We must put up with what happens in Frankfurt. The Minister correctly noted yesterday that we can expect a contraction next year in our largest industry, comprising those 250,000 construction workers who have turned out 200,000 units in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>

	<P>Deputy Broughan should be allowed to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We no longer control monetary policy. It is therefore incumbent on the Minister for Finance to bring forward a different type of budget. That is the point I wished to make if the Minister of State had only waited to hear it. To use Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s parlance, the Government is turning the corner into the straight. It is approaching the end. It is the mass of PAYE workers and the approximately 1 million citizens living on social welfare benefits who inevitably will have to pick up the pieces from the Government&rsquo;s fiscal failures in the past eight years.</P>
      <P>Many commentators have referred this week to the archaic nature of the presentation of the budget. Mr. Vincent Browne, among others, called for budget day in its current format to be abolished and I strongly support that position. As our party leader said this morning, we must finally become like other European democracies in terms of the budgetary process. During the course of 2006, we should discuss the Estimates in detail for every Department and make our suggestions. Deputies and Senators should take the primary role in this rather than well-intentioned interest groups outside the House. By autumn 2006 and in subsequent years, we should be able to make a presentation to the Minister which could become the format of the budget in the future.</P>
      <P>Such a process has never happened. Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance said they will lean in this direction next year but it is almost certain that the reforms proposed by the Committee of Public Accounts and other serious commentators will not happen. Most important, the budget day anachronism prevents a transparent, <Col N="148"/>informed and reasonably lengthy debate on the grotesque unfairness of Irish society, which is as bad today, and will be tomorrow and next month, as it was yesterday and last month. Yesterday&rsquo;s budget did little or nothing for the 50,000 Irish citizens, 5,000 of whom are in my constituency, who are on the housing waiting list. It did little or nothing to resolve the crisis in accident and emergency services. It made no specific proposals to deal with the substantial problems in the health sector.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance gave the House some waffle about third level education yesterday, I was surprised that he had the brass neck to speak about PhDs in light of the recent debacle in respect of the chief science adviser to the Government. He spoke about the need to provide resources for fourth level education, but I remind him that just 10% of the children in many parishes in my constituency complete second level education and go on to third level education.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has left the Chamber before listening to the conclusion of my contribution. This country&rsquo;s meagre rates of social welfare continue to be a national disgrace. According to the forecasts of <i>The Economist</i>, Ireland will be the second wealthiest country in the world next year, with an average <i>per capita</i> income of &euro;52,000. The Minister for Finance was thrilled with himself yesterday when he increased the level of unemployment assistance &mdash; the basic social welfare rate &mdash; to &euro;165 per week, or a miserly &euro;7,500 per annum. It is disgraceful that it is even lower &mdash;&euro;5,000 &mdash; in the case of an adult dependant. Deputy Stagg was quite right to interrupt the Minister yesterday to ask him what he was talking about. It is an appalling disgrace that nothing is being done in this area. I note that a former Minister for Social and Family Affairs is in attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I will send the Deputy down the glen in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not succeed in increasing the basic social welfare rates by &euro;17 per week. Given the base rates we have, such an increase will do nothing anyway. Such a bland gesture will not help the development of any form of social justice.</P>
      <P>The decisions made on taxation policy are the central instruments of any budget. Many pages of examples and tables have been published to illustrate how the changes in this budget will affect single workers on the average industrial wage, for example, or couples with one or two children. The gains which will accrue to such people as a result of the changes made to the tax code in this budget are of just 1%, 1.2% or<?oasys _jy?>1.3%. The people to whom I refer will benefit by a miserly couple of hundred of euro as a result of this bland and conservative budget, which lacked flair and a vision for this country. As the Govern<Col N="149"/>ment approaches the end of its term in office, I am aware that Ministers from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats are frantically looking to Opposition Members in the hope that we will somehow continue this era of prosperity after the next general election.</P>

      <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget was a grave disappointment for those of us concerned about the development of cancer care. One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer and one in four people will die from cancer. In view of these facts, I asked the T&aacute;naiste just over a month ago to outline the priority in the cancer services area that she would seek to pursue in budget 2006. I received my answer yesterday when cancer services were not even mentioned. The provision of radiotherapy services at Waterford Regional Hospital for the south-east region is a matter of great concern to the people of that region, including the people of Waterford. The T&aacute;naiste announced last July that the Government&rsquo;s plan for a national network of radiation oncology services will be pursued by means of a public-private partnership. Under the plan, WRH will have an integrated satellite unit as part of the network. Most of the capital investment necessary to develop the unit will be drawn from the public-private partnership aspect of the network. The T&aacute;naiste told me earlier this month, in response to a written parliamentary question that the necessary preparatory work is being done by the National Development Finance Agency and the Health Service Executive. Yesterday&rsquo;s budget added significantly to my increasing concern that nothing is really happening and that the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement of last July amounts to a pol<Col N="150"/>itical stunt to get the Progressive Democrats-Fianna F&aacute;il Government through the next general election. I challenge the T&aacute;naiste to give the House a full progress report on what is really happening to the integrated satellite centre at WRH.</P>
      <P>For many years, Fianna F&aacute;il has prided itself on its aspirations of reuniting the country and restoring the Irish language. It was appalling, therefore, that there was not a single word of Irish in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s speech yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>There was no reference to the Irish language in yesterday&rsquo;s Budget Statement. I hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is concerned not only because no Irish was spoken by his colleague, Deputy Cowen, yesterday but because the Minister for Finance, who is the deputy leader of a party that has traded for a long time on its policy of restoring the Irish language, did not even mention that language and the possibility of its revival.</P>
      <P>The proposed social finance initiative was the only aspect of yesterday&rsquo;s budget that related to the voluntary and community sectors, another matter that is part of my brief. The Minister for Finance said he will talk to the banks, which have indicated that they will talk to him, about seed capital and the availability of loans for the voluntary and community sectors. That is all that was offered to a sector that is central to the future quality of life of many people here.</P>
      <P>Security issues were not mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, yesterday. The quality of life of many people in all parts of the country is in decline because they are worried about the security of their homes. The tendency of certain people to engage in anti-social behaviour is increasing, but that was not addressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The scourge of cocaine use is another matter on which the Minister for Finance failed to reflect yesterday. It is estimated that cocaine worth approximately &euro;110 million reached our streets in the first ten months of this year, but the Minister did not mention this worsening problem. The use of cocaine in Britain is increasing because it is more socially acceptable and it is becoming cheaper. There were 25 million cocaine users and 2 million cocaine addicts in the United States in the mid-1990s. The level of use of this dangerous drug has become a scourge. Cocaine use has become a middle-class activity in many ways. The snorting of cocaine by middle-class people at weekends is euphemistically referred to as the leisure use of the drug.</P>
      <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s budget was a failure in many respects. Although a great deal of money could have been used to deal with problems in community life, such as the scourges which affect <Col N="151"/>ordinary people, little or nothing was on offer yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I am due to call the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, at this point. As a result of an oversight in the notification and scheduling of speakers, Deputy Ring, who has been present in the House and offering to speak for some time, was not called as the last speaker. With the agreement of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I propose to call Deputy Ring to speak for 15 minutes before the Minister speaks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was somewhat bemused to learn a couple of minutes ago that there was to be a change in the scheduling of speakers. The reason for the confusion was not really explained to me. The schedules of some Members on this side of the House have been put back all day because of the raucous behaviour of Opposition Members on the Order of Business this morning. Some of us are in some difficulty as a result. I will allow Deputy Ring to speak before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>I had a long speech from the Department on the budget, mainly dealing with the Department of Foreign Affairs covering passports, biometrics and all the money involved in the Estimates etc. It also dealt with decentralisation and overseas development aid. However, having listened to Deputy Broughan who was his party&rsquo;s spokesperson on social welfare when I was Minister in that area, I decided to bin my printed speech and rise to the bait as I always loved to do when we were sparring partners.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, will refer to overseas development aid later. Under the Government the largest increase ever in overseas development aid has been delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government abandoned the target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Since the previous Government came to office, we have trebled overseas development aid and the increase this year alone is more <Col N="152"/>than the allocation under the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government in the budget for 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We all remember the target of 0.7% by 2007.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Between now and 2012 we will again treble overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>I wish to speak about social welfare and the improvements announced in the budget. It is like old times listening to Deputy Broughan. He will remember that when I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on successive budgets the Government delivered record amounts. Some &pound;870 million was given in two successive years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were very low rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Social welfare in 2006 will be more than quadruple the level set when Labour and Fine Gael were last in Government. We reformed the social welfare area and Deputy Broughan must acknowledge that instead of getting payments late in the year they are now given on 1 January, in effect five months earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true, except for the child benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

These are flagship projects which will greatly enhance the quality of our cultural infrastructure. The Abbey Theatre is at the centre of Ireland&rsquo;s theatrical and cultural life. It has been recognised for some time that its existing premises fall short of the requirements of a vibrant national theatre. A suitable site has now been made available for the redevelopment of the theatre by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.

	<P>The next stage is to examine options for procuring the theatre as a PPP including the incorporation of a separate international design competition. I will report back to Government on this aspect by the end of February 2006. I am pleased the capital envelope announced yesterday will enable me to proceed with the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall as a PPP. That provision is being made next year to enable the process of acquiring the site for a new state-of-the-art concert hall to get under way. The provision of a signature premises on a par with those in capital cities across Europe will enable the National Concert Hall to meet the current and expanding market demand for musical entertainment and cultural events. I have noted that the National Concert Hall, within its limited space at Earlsfort Terrace, is highly energetic and operates with a strong market focus. Seat occupancy consistently exceeds 80% with patrons being turned away from many house full events. The new facility incorporating a 2,000 seat auditorium will enable the National Concert Hall to meet public demand much more effectively, including the staging of key performances by top class world artists at reasonable ticket prices.</P>
      <P>I am also delighted that the Theatre Royal in Wexford will be refurbished and remodelled. The Theatre Royal is the venue for the world famous <Col N="157"/>Wexford opera festival. For 50 years the festival has been a key event in the cultural life of Ireland and has won extensive international acclaim. The existing Theatre Royal has been at the centre of the festival&rsquo;s success but needs substantial upgrading to meet the festival&rsquo;s future needs. It is a worthwhile development of immense importance to the cultural life of Ireland and of particular significance to Wexford and its hinterland.</P>
      <P>My one regret in confirming the redevelopment of the Theatre Royal is that Mr. Jerome Hynes, the former chief executive of the Wexford festival opera, cannot be with us to share the good news. Jerome should take much of the credit for this decision. He drove the project forward with his far-sighted planning, unlimited energy and focus and extraordinary persistence. His work has finally borne fruit and he will long be missed by us all.</P>
      <P>The Gaiety Theatre is one of the few facilities in Dublin capable of staging large-scale opera productions. This refurbishment will enable the Gaiety to fulfil this key role into the future. This suite of investments represents an extremely important initiative by the Government in that it addresses key infrastructural deficiencies in our national cultural infrastructure which will make the arts more accessible to all our people. It will also enhance the quality of our cultural tourism offering to our overseas visitors.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the artists&rsquo; tax exemption is being retained for qualified income up to &euro;250,000. The level at which the exemption mechanism is pitched will continue to encourage artistic activity. There will be no flights of either activity or income. Furthermore, it will encourage other taxable activity by artists in this country as the effective rate of tax on those with high incomes in Ireland compares favourably internationally.</P>
      <P>Under this Government considerable progress has been made to bring Ireland&rsquo;s sporting infrastructure into line with best international standards. In the area of major capital development we continue to provide important investment funding in partnership with sports governing bodies in large capital projects. During recent years the Exchequer has provided &euro;110 million to the GAA as an input 3, the spending development that has been undertaken at Croke Park. More recently, grant aid of &euro;191 million has been committed by the Exchequer towards the development of a stadium of Lansdowne Road in partnership with the IRFU and the FAI. A sum of &euro;20 million will be provided in the Vote of my Department for this project in 2006. This project is progressing according to its challenging schedule and will be delivered over the next four years. I am pleased to say that the planning application is almost completed and should be ready for lodgment at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>I am happy to confirm the commencement of the Abbotstown sports campus. In this budget the Government has agreed to provide funding of <Col N="158"/>&euro;9.5 million in 2006 to enable work to start on phase 1 of the project which has been costed at &euro;119 million and will be delivered over a four to five year timeframe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>A considerable effort had been put into the discussion and planning stage of the project. These plans have been endorsed by the Government and the work will commence early next year.</P>

	<P>Ireland is on track to provide state-of-the-art facilities for sports men and women to train and prepare for competition at the highest level. A range of facilities will also be available to the public and the training needs of more than 30 governing bodies of sport. Irish sport deserves no less. Looking forward to the run-up to the London Olympics of 2012, Ireland can become an attractive option as a training base for international Olympic teams. Irish Olympic hopefuls will have excellent training facilities available to them at home and they will benefit from the transfer of expertise through contact with their international competitors.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, plays a crucial role in the development of the quality sports infrastructure needed to enhance participation and improved performance in sport. Under the programme, funding is allocated towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level and is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sports and recreational facilities in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Since 1998 the Government has allocated funding amounting to &euro;386 million under the programme to more than 4,900 projects to provide badly needed facilities and equipment in virtually every parish, village, town and city throughout Ireland. We have an ambitious swimming pool programme in conjunction with the local authorities whereby 18 new pools have been built and seven are under construction while a further 30 are moving through various stages of planning, leading to construction.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented level of funding for sport, which will continue in 2006, has increased the quantity and transformed the quality of sports facilities available countrywide. Important facilities, such as swimming pools, dressing rooms, pitches, floodlighting, modern sports equipment and so on, have allowed schemes to be developed to get people of all ages and from all backgrounds more involved in sport.</P>
      <P>The budget for 2006, together with increased Estimate allocations for next year, will benefit the tourism sector. The major issue facing Irish tourism is competitiveness. The budget for 2006, with <Col N="159"/>an emphasis on sustaining order in the public finances, minimising inflation and avoiding increases in direct taxes and excise duties, will support the Irish tourism industry in developing value for money and meeting international competition. I welcome a number of measures in the budget which impact favourably on tourism. The availability of accelerated capital allowance in the past has been of critical importance in encouraging investment and the provision of tourism accommodation in particular in hotels. The number of hotel rooms has almost doubled from 26,000 in 1996 to approximately 45,000 at present. Our hotel stock is among the most modern in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>All the rooms in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>The extension announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in the cut-off date for investment in hotel projects in the pipeline to benefit under the generous accelerated capital allowances will facilitate the orderly progression of projects and help to ensure that any further additions to stock are warranted by clear and identified market potential.</P>
      <P>The increase in the VAT exemption limit for small service businesses will benefit small accommodation providers, including those in the bed and breakfast sector who are under some pressure owing to changes in consumer demand and tastes, as will the change from monthly to quarterly filing of PAYE forms.</P>
      <P>Tourism is no longer a Cinderella industry. It is very much centre stage and the Government has shown its unrelenting commitment to it by resourcing our tourism agencies as never before. For 2006 I have secured an unprecedented level of Exchequer resources for tourism development, &euro;134 million, representing an increase of 7% on 2005. The investment will enable the tourism agencies, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, to deliver in full their ambitious marketing and development plans for 2006 which were unveiled to the industry&rsquo;s major promotional event earlier in the week. The increased marketing fund will enable both agencies to step up significantly their gain on the marketing front in 2006. In securing the largest ever allocation of &euro;40 million for the tourism marketing fund, I have specifically asked the agencies to focus on stimulating regional spread, promoting greater use of special interest products, in particular golf, to benefit from our hosting of the Ryder Cup next September, capitalising on air access developments and enhancing our e-marketing capabilities.</P>

	<P>I wish to say a few words about that programme. It is the envy of the world and is one the most highly regarded programmes in the world because we focus all our efforts on the poorest of the poor. Some 80% of what we spend on the bilateral programme goes to the poorest countries, the least developed countries of sub-Saharan Africa. I am proud of that programme which has been built and tripled in size since 1997. Under this budget the highest percentage increase in any area of spending has occurred in the area of overseas aid. We have achieved a 24% increase in our spending budget line. That is an enormous increase and poses enormous challenges for the future.</P>

	<P>While Ireland is now a prosperous country, we cannot afford to take prosperity for granted. It is on this principle that the choices in the budget were based. We must strive for economic success and insist on prudent fiscal management to achieve the establishment of a better society for all. We must prioritise infrastructural investment so that firms can compete and we must ensure that even more people can become involved in our economy and benefit from its success.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to helping those on low incomes and supporting family life. This budget will help to create a more inclusive society for all of us. To this end social welfare measures, costing &euro;1.12 billion, will be implemented. These changes will improve the living standards of 970,000 social welfare recipients. It is important to state again the specific improvements announced.

	<P>The non-contributory pension will rise by &euro;16 per week, or 9.6%, and the first &euro;100 of income earned will be disregarded for means test purposes to facilitate pensioners who want to work beyond retirement age without being penalised. Elderly persons will also benefit from the new home care packages, additional day care support and palliative care, helping elderly people to avoid unnecessary and prolonged stays in residential care hospitals.</P>
      <P>Those on the lowest rates of social welfare will all receive an increase of &euro;17 per week, bringing the lowest full personal social welfare payment to &euro;165.80 per week, which is an increase of 11%. The monthly rate of child benefit will rise to &euro;150 for the first and second child and to &euro;185 for the third child and subsequent children. This year we will spend approximately &euro;2 billion on child benefit alone compared with just &euro;500 million five years ago.</P>
      <P>A major theme of this budget was the very pressing issue of child care. The Government is conscious of the difficulties faced by families in this regard. Our task is to assist all parents, in particular during the early years of child rearing. To this end we have developed a five year child care strategy to tackle the problem by increasing options for parents in a balanced manner. This package will cost &euro;317 million, rising to &euro;600 million a year by 2008. On the supply side a major new national child care investment programme will run from 2006 to 2010 and will support the creation of 50,000 new child care places through capital grants to private child care operators. Income earned by child minders caring for children in the minders&rsquo; own homes will be exempt from income tax and PRSI up to &euro;10,000.</P>
      <P>The Government is mindful of the importance of the first year of life in a child&rsquo;s development. Consequently, significant extensions to maternity leave are being made over the next two years. From March next, mothers of new-born children will have four additional weeks paid maternity leave, extending such leave to 22 weeks. This leave will be further extended by four weeks in 2007, so that mothers of new-born children will be entitled to a full six months paid maternity leave.</P>
      <P>A new early child care supplement will be introduced which acknowledges the costs parents face, particularly those with pre-school children. This will be a direct payment available to all parents of pre-school children regardless of the parents&rsquo; labour force status. The payment will be worth &euro;1,000 per year for each child up to their sixth birthday. This supplement will be exempt from income tax, PRSI and levies and will be paid <Col N="166"/>quarterly to parents of approximately 350,000 children under the age of six, costing &euro;353 million in a full year. This new payment with child benefit will mean that in 2006 a family with two children under six will receive more than &euro;5,000. This is a significant step forward in assisting families to meet child care costs.</P>
      <P>The Government has radically restructured the taxation system. As a result more than one third of the work force are now outside the tax net completely. Yesterday&rsquo;s budget will mean that even more workers are taken out of the tax net and all those on the minimum wage will be exempt from paying income tax. The total cost of the income tax package is &euro;900 million in a full year. Among the personal taxation measures contained in the budget were the employee tax credit, which will rise by &euro;220 per year and personal tax credits which will rise by &euro;50 per year. The tax exemption limit for persons aged 65 and over will increase by &euro;500 single and &euro;1,000 married, removing 1,700 elderly income earners from the tax net. The standard rate band will rise by &euro;2,600 per year, just less than 9%, removing more than 90,000 taxpayers from the top rate of tax, ensuring that all those earning close to the projected average industrial wage will pay no more than the lower rate of income tax. To assist lower paid workers, the health levy threshold is increased to &euro;440 per week, benefiting 72,300 lower paid workers.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, a major review of tax reliefs was undertaken with the aim of achieving a fairer, more equitable tax system.</P>

	<P>I will conclude because I could talk about the good news from this budget for a long time. It contains many other measures I did not have time to discuss. Importantly, I believe this budget will sustain our economic growth and create a more equitable society for all by cutting taxes, increasing social welfare payments, assisting parents with child care costs, investing in infrastructure and following a balanced budgetary policy.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Kehoe and Pat Breen. I note that the senior Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, discarded his script which included a piece on decentralisation. Then the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who has responsibility for decentralisation, spoke but did not refer to decentralisation. The word &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; was great and I remember the Fianna F&aacute;il choir playing the music and clapping former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, out the door.

	<P>The word &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; was a buzz word and this week the Minister decentralised 100 jobs from Mayo, the county I represent. I thought decentralisation involved moving jobs and people out of Dublin to rural Ireland. I am disappointed the west of Ireland Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, allowed 100 jobs to be move from the Department of Agriculture and Food in Castlebar to Portlaoise. What kind of west of Ireland man is Deputy Treacy? That is the kind of decentralisation we have in Ireland, moving jobs from the west of Ireland to the midlands.</P>

People expect arrogance from the Progressive Democrats. This budget was a wasted opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing"><NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
	<P>This budget was a wasted opportunity but there is such a crowd of wasters on the Government side that it does not surprise me. The people have been feeling the pinch for the past few years. We have seen rip-off Ireland, in which the poor get poorer, the rich, whom the Government loves, get richer and the middle class gets squeezed. This budget has done nothing for the poor and the middle class. When it attempts to put its child care package into operation I can see nothing but difficulties for the Government. I hope this will not be so, as I know of people who find it difficult to live because of child care costs. I thought the Government would announce positive measures for these people but instead they received a pittance.</P>
      <P>Today, constituents informed me that child care facilities and cr&egrave;ches had already raised prices before the budget was announced. Although a bonanza was expected, it did not materialise.</P>
      <P>All voluntary groups agree the best way to target poverty is through child benefit. A measly increase was announced and the Government decided it was more important to remove 1% <Col N="169"/>from betting tax. What control does the betting industry have over the Government? Why does the Government look after the betting industry in every budget?</P>
      <P>The only positive measure in yesterday&rsquo;s budget was that people in the blood industry will have to pay tax. It was outrageous that people on low incomes paid tax but people such as Mr. Magner and Sir Alex Ferguson nearly brought down Manchester United and their business over the bloodstock industry and the famous horse, Rock of Gibralter.</P>
      <P>People on low incomes should be treated better. I listened to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, a man who is not as aggressive as many of the Ministers. At a committee meeting we asked him to deal with widows and widowers and I was disappointed no initiative was announced to assist them. These people find themselves in a difficult position when they lose a loved one.</P>
      <P>People with child dependants are at the same rate for the past ten years. Has a loaf of bread, a pint of milk or a pair of shoes stayed at the same price for the past ten years? I am sick of the Government referring to a time when Fine Gael was in Government. It is so long since we were in Government that it will not be long more until we are back in Government after the next election. Fianna F&aacute;il has been in Government for ten years so it should blame itself for the way it has let down the poor.</P>
      <P>We see between 200 and 300 billionaires not paying any tax in this State. They fly into this country for All-Ireland matches and race meetings and this is a disgrace. I call on the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to protect the increases received yesterday so that they are not wiped out by price increases on phones, ESB bills or food bills or by the county councils taking &euro;4 of &euro;5 from the &euro;17 poor people got yesterday.</P>
      <P>I have listened to debates about health in this country. The Government Deputies have spoken about elderly people and the package for them in the budget. The greatest scandal in the last two years has been the cutbacks in home help. Government Deputies are talking about the &euro;150 million package but every day I am contacted by people in my constituency who have received letters from the health board informing them that it is cutting back on their home help. Is that not hypocrisy? Deputies on the opposite side are talking about a home care package, which is something I suggested two years ago, but they have done nothing to bring it about.</P>
      <P>Most people want to live, die and care for their loved ones at home. There are no places for elderly people in State nursing homes or in private nursing homes, which they often cannot afford anyway. They are being left in bed and are not looked after because this Government does not care about them. All it cares about is the super rich. We had an opportunity in the last five or six years to improve the situation, with so much <Col N="170"/>money in the country, but that money has been squandered by every single Minister in every Department. We see the over-runs and how much programme managers and special advisers are being paid while the people on low incomes have been let down.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to ensure that whatever increases people on social welfare received in the budget will be protected and not clawed back by stealth taxes. There were 27 stealth taxes in operation last year. In the next few weeks county councils will finalise their estimates and we will see increases in refuse, water and other charges to pay for benchmark increases for the officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Ring is a difficult act to follow. Some of the Deputies opposite are also very hard to follow because they really believe in their own rhetoric. It will be very hard to convince some of them that this was not such a great budget. It was a headline-grabbing, cautious, pre-election budget. I welcome the elements of the budget that look after people on social welfare but overall, it is a missed opportunity for this Government.</P>
      <P>There is much expectation before budgets but not so much afterwards. What difference will this budget make to those sitting in traffic, on hospital waiting lists, waiting for orthodontic treatment and sitting in prefabricated school buildings? Will their situation change tomorrow or in two or three years&rsquo; time? I do not think so. Will the homeless be looked after following this budget? I do not think so.</P>
      <P>This Government has made endless promises. It came to power in June 1997 and will be in Government for ten years by June 2007.</P>

	<P>From Kavanagh&rsquo;s pub, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister of State conducted a poll this evening, most people would say that Mr. Ivan Yates was one of the most-liked and strongest Ministers for Agriculture this State ever had. He did a lot for agriculture, unlike the current Minister. One only has to look at the beet industry &mdash; for the first time in the history of the State, an agricultural crop has totally disappeared. I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on that but he will not say any<Col N="171"/>thing because he knows it is an absolute disaster. One of the best cash crops in Cork, Carlow and Wexford has been wiped out by the Government.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the promised by-passes at Enniscorthy, New Ross and Gorey. The latter has, admittedly, started but will take a long time to be completed. These were promised in 2002 and earlier, but the promises were empty. Problems at St. John&rsquo;s Hospital have been ongoing for 20 years. Phase one of the hospital has been built and we are still awaiting phase two, which I cannot understand. This is yet another promise made for County Wexford that has not been delivered.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance spoke about third and fourth level education. I welcome the allocation of moneys to that area and also the Minister&rsquo;s plan for its development. I note that it is another five-year plan and I would like to know how many plans the Government actually has because it will run out soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>No it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Every time there is an announcement, it involves a five-year plan or a ten-year plan. I cannot understand this.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has drawn up another plan for third and fourth level education, which I welcome. However, the Government should focus on primary and secondary education in the first instance. I presume it drew up a plan for those sectors years ago but it has not been completed yet.</P>
      <P>In the context of education, I wish to focus on two specific schools. The first is Gorey community school, which is totally overcrowded, with 1,500 students under one roof. The safety standards are so low they are horrifying. The principal is in absolute turmoil. More Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers have visited the school than I have had hot dinners. The second school is the gaelscoil in Enniscorthy. The most recent announcement for that school was the allocation of eight brand new prefabricated classrooms. No doubt, they will be left there for another 20 years, until they are dilapidated and in disrepair.</P>
      <P>This budget has not been so perfect for this Government. I welcome certain elements of it, for example, the provisions for younger farmers. However, there are fewer younger farmers now than in the past. They are not opting to go on to the land because the Government has made it very difficult for them. Young farmers see there is no living to be made from farming.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in excise duty on kerosene but the Minister of Finance forgot about the hauliers, who are paying over the odds for diesel. We are totally dependent on roads for freight transport because the Government has not invested sufficiently in the rail infrastructure. The cost of road transport has gone through the roof. <Col N="172"/>In that context, I reiterate that this is not such a good budget.</P>
      <P>Almost every Deputy on this side of the House has mentioned decentralisation but it is notable that none of the Government Deputies has done so. Deputy Dermot Ahern referred to it in his written script, but he scrapped the script and chose to ad-lib instead. I do not blame him for doing that. Under the decentralisation programme, 85 jobs were earmarked for Enniscorthy, 130 for New Ross and 325 for Wexford town. There was great fanfare in 2003 when decentralisation was announced. There was such a rush out through the door of the House, I thought the Government Deputies were going to bring it and the walls down with them. They dashed out to speak to their local radio stations and newspapers and there was great fanfare. Senior Fianna F&aacute;il members told people in Wexford that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, An Bord Glas and Bord Bia would be located in Enniscorthy, but there is no site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>There is Teagasc in Johnstown House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Ivan Yates brought that about. What would we do without him? What would we do if Fine Gael had not been in Government from 1994 to 1997 to ensure Wexford was not neglected? I am glad the Minister of State raised Johnstown Castle and said that a Fine Gael Government located it there.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I did not say that.</P>

	<P>Deputy Kehoe without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulKehoeFG"><NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a Fine Gael Government that set up Teagasc in Johnstown Castle. I thank the Minister of State for reminding the House of that. I do not wish to blow our trumpet too much about what we have done for County Wexford because it makes the other side of the House look bad.</P>
      <P>We handed the present Government a healthy economy in 1997 but it has squandered it and neglected this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the budget. It was an attempt to try to please everybody but it has pleased nobody. It was extremely unimaginative.</P>
      <P>The child care provisions were a knee-jerk reaction to voters&rsquo; concerns on the doorsteps of the commuter belts of Meath and Kildare. Most of these people, and homeowners everywhere, will still be reeling from the extortionate stamp duty rates on their homes. As the reality of their <Col N="173"/>slightly improved circumstances sinks in, they will quickly face the challenge of rising child care costs. As my colleague, Deputy Bruton, said yesterday, this was a blatant attempt at a give-back to overtaxed and long-suffering middle and low income earners who have seen their salaries attacked from all sides by stealth taxes. In reality this budget has failed to tackle the many key problems of modern living, not just in the congested, overcrowded gridlock of the east coast but in all regions of the country where the centralised policies of the past nine years of this Government have left a legacy of under-investment, economic imbalance and rural decline.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the &euro;150 million package to old age pensioners, but that is less than the amount spent on the PPARS wastage. As some of my colleagues pointed out yesterday, the benefits of this will not emerge immediately in 2006 but over an unspecified period. In my constituency many pensioners will give a qualified welcome to the pension increases of between &euro;14 and &euro;16 per week but will know that the value of such an amount will quickly vanish with the price increases of rip-off Ireland. The increase is a miserly nod to the very people who built up this State and have contributed over the decades as taxpayers. The Minister said that this increase puts his Government well on target for reaching the &euro;200 per week mark by 2007. Obviously that is the election year but it would be much more welcome if the Government had reached its target in 2006 to help the many vulnerable people cope with rip-off Ireland.</P>
      <P>Only this morning a constituent rang me at my office in Clare welcoming the increase in the carer&rsquo;s allowance from &euro;153 to &euro;180 but wondering where the job security was for this undervalued service. It keeps elderly people in their homes, provides them with company and comfort, frees up essential spaces in our nursing homes, contributes to a sense of local community and provides a modest measure of local employment. I had no answer for that person. He must soldier on, providing his essential service while the Government makes other noises in the House. Meanwhile rural Ireland continues to suffer. Just last week &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; highlighted the anti-social behaviour in rural towns. What has happened to the 2,000 extra garda&iacute; promised by this Government? As usual, they are just a promise.</P>
      <P>What has happened to the budget for fighting crime? Why can the extra garda&iacute; I sought in this House from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not be deployed to Kilrush to fight the problem there with anti-social behaviour?</P>
      <P>A decent level of public transport for rural areas in the west would also have arrested decline. Transport 21 seems already to be gathering dust in the office of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, pointed out that just &euro;1.5 billion a year has been put aside for Transport 21, a plan <Col N="174"/>that has been estimated to cost &euro;35 billion. Meanwhile the Minister remains coy about the cost of upgrading the western rail corridor. It is generally believed that it will cost well over &euro;300 million, less than 1% of the &euro;34 billion promised by the Government to be spent on projects in the west. What provision has been made for applying meaningful transport policies to the west and what will the projected spend be? I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on this but have received very little in the way of answers.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has joined us. I hope there will be meaningful change for people in small enterprises which are important and are the way forward for this country. We should have put more emphasis on small enterprises to boost not just the west but the whole of the country. A colleague from County Clare tabled a question on the number of new jobs created by IDA Ireland in the county in the past seven years. The answer was seven. The Government&rsquo;s commitment to job creation in the small business sector is disappointing in the extreme. It has failed to provide the incentive to boost indigenous business, the backbone of our rural economy, or to provide the training or educational opportunities for employees. The VAT threshold increases fall far short of what was sought by the lobby groups and well short of what the UK provides.</P>
      <P>Overall, the broadening of the PAYE tax bands is welcome, but yet again a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Finance has failed to tackle the issue of indexing the tax bands. The benefits will again be eroded by inflation and price increases as wage rises meet these costs.</P>
      <P>Much has been said on the creation of fourth level education but where is the investment in our primary sector to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio? Only two weeks ago in Ennis, 600 people turned out to protest at the pupil-teacher ratio in schools throughout County Clare. We need to bring our schools up to a decent modern standard to give our children a decent start in life. Those over six might well be concerned after yesterday&rsquo;s budget because without a voice, they have failed once again to receive their due. Will their parents remember this come election time?</P>
      <P>Accident and emergency services are under extreme pressure throughout the country. The accident and emergency services in Ennis General Hospital were promised &euro;20 million over recent years but nothing will happen for maybe two years yet. Only last week I tabled a question on a CAT scanner, which is an essential part of a modern hospital, but was told once again it would depend on funding and budgets.</P>
      <P>Most speakers have referred to decentralisation. We know that very few people want to go to Shannon with Enterprise Ireland. Kilrush is oversubscribed &mdash; 66 people have put their names down to transfer &mdash; but they are not from the Revenue Commissioners. However I welcome the fact that they want to live in Kilrush because <Col N="175"/>it will boost the town at a time when it has developed something of a bad name.</P>
      <P>From what we could gather yesterday, the budget was predictable and bears the hallmark of a Government that has run out of fresh ideas and is limping on until the next election in 2007. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will have another attempt to fool the people but he will not succeed because they are tired of this Government and want change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I warmly welcome the budget for 2006 presented to this House yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. I am confident the budget is good for business, work and the economy. It puts in place the essential strategies that will ensure Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness in future. In the space of less than 15 years we have built a new, robust and successful economy, underpinned over the past eight years by the sound policies of the Government, which have ensured that the fruits of our success have been cultivated carefully, used wisely and distributed fairly. We have generated an economy that is the envy of many and a model that others are seeking to follow.</P>
      <P>At the root of this exceptional performance is a deeply embedded commitment to pursue policies in a joined-up way across Government that boosts our competitiveness, a competitiveness that provides us with the means to improve equality and opportunity for all in society.</P>
      <P>Budget 2006 represents a continuation of those policies and it will prove to be a watershed in terms of investment in our human capital, helping those on low income and social welfare payments, ensuring a business friendly yet fair tax system and in providing significant supports for child care, employment and entrepreneurship.</P>
      <P>The Government&rsquo;s policies in the areas of employment and the labour market have delivered unprecedented success for our people. Employment increased by 96,000 in the 12 months to August 2005, bringing the total number of people at work to just under 2 million and we expect to create a further 60,000 jobs in 2006. Unemployment continues to be maintained at a low level of 4.3%, which is half the EU average. Long-term unemployment stands at 1.4%, which again is well below the EU average. Building on this exceptional performance, budget 2006 will support the continued growth of business and jobs in the economy.</P>
      <P>While we now have record numbers in employment, upskilling the workforce is area which needs to be addressed if Ireland is to maintain its position as a leading-edge, knowledge-based economy. The 6% increase in funding from the national training fund for 2006 announced in the Book of Estimates a few weeks ago reflects my <Col N="176"/>Department&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion of lifelong learning as a means of supporting the knowledge-based economy. Combined with a 9% increase in Exchequer funding for F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s training and integration supports, a total of &euro;429 million will be available in my Department&rsquo;s Vote in 2006 for up-skilling people in and for employment.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the budget announcement of &euro;1.2 billion over the next five years to support change, innovation and infrastructure in higher education. This investment is a vital component in responding to the needs of our increasingly knowledge based economy and society. This investment and the development of the PhD fourth level of education has perfect synergy with my Department&rsquo;s investments through our enterprise agencies and Science Foundation Ireland and focus on driving investment in knowledge, research and development as a fundamental component of future competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The substantial tax relief package in this budget has been widely welcomed by business and it reinforces the Government commitment to a low tax economy, it further incentivises employment, reduces pressure on labour costs and rewards workers. I particularly welcome the benefits to the average industrial earner, who will pay tax at the lower rate in 2006. The removal of those on the minimum wage from the tax net will assist those who are unemployed to transfer to the active labour market.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s decision to increase the VAT thresholds for small businesses will remove 2,200 businesses from the VAT net and will support small business development into the future. Last July, I established the small business forum to examine whether the strategies being followed supported and developed the spirit of entrepreneurship in Ireland. One of the issues that came out of the forum&rsquo;s deliberations was the fact that the current VAT registration thresholds were too low and had not been revised since 1994. The forum noted that an increase in the VAT registration thresholds would reduce compliance costs of accounting for VAT and would encourage early stage entrepreneurial activity.</P>
      <P>In the Finance Act 2004, we reduced the capital duty on shares from 1% to 0.5%. The Minister, in budget 2006, has eliminated this tax which was an additional cost incurred by Irish companies raising capital by means of issuing shares. Now that we have eliminated this tax, it will further enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a place from which to do business, it will assist those businesses operating in the financial services sector and reduce the cost incurred by Irish companies raising capital by means of issuing shares.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the major investment by the Minister in a new national child care investment programme will help to promote increased participation in the labour market, with the creation of an extra 50,000 child care places up to 2010. This initiative responds to the European employment <Col N="177"/>recommendations which have been made to Ireland calling for the provision of a greater number of affordable child care places to support the needs of those in, or wishing to join, the labour force. I wholeheartedly support the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s decision to make a significant investment in this area, one that will continue to be built upon over a five year period.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation to my Department for the five years 2006-10 amounts to just under &euro;2.5 billion. This represents an increase of &euro;271 million on the five year envelope for the period 2005-09 and reflects commitment to significant on-going investment in science and technology development, capital support for indigenous and foreign firms and upgrading F&Aacute;S training capacity to improve the skills of apprentices and other new entrants to the labour market.</P>
      <P>With the increased capital envelop, my Department&rsquo;s allocation for science and technology will amount to &euro;257 million, a &euro;39 million increase on 2005 and a reflection of the continuation of the significant investment in science and technology which has been underway now for a number of years. The extra funding announced in the budget will be used to increase in-company research and development and to strengthen collaboration between industry and the education sector and will follow through to the subsequent years of the five year capital envelope.</P>
      <P>Science and technology remain at the forefront of the Government&rsquo;s priorities. To sustain economic growth and prosperity, we must achieve a globally competitive knowledge-based economy with high levels of research, development and innovation. The Government&rsquo;s goal is that by 2013, Ireland will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and will be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress within an innovation-driven culture. The commitment to investing heavily in science and technology, as demonstrated in the budget, will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as an ideal location for research and development.</P>
      <P>Budget 2006 will put more money into the pockets of workers, particularly the lower paid. The Government is committed to keeping inflation down and ensuring that consumers get value for money. As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am determined that consumers will not be taken advantage of because of their increased spending power. My Department&rsquo;s spending on consumer affairs will increase by 76% in 2006 to &euro;7.2 million. As well as continuing to fund the work of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the increased allocation will support the activities of the interim board of the new national consumer agency which I appointed last June. A total of &euro;3 million of new funding will be allocated to the interim board to carry out some initial work in the area of consumer awareness, advocacy and targeted <Col N="178"/>research and to prepare for the establishment of the statutorily-based agency.</P>
      <P>The allocation for the Competition Authority for 2006 has also been increased by 15%, to &euro;5.831 million. This will provide the authority with the opportunity to double resources in its cartel enforcement division and enable it to substantially increase the number of investigations that it can carry out into criminal breaches of the Competition Act. These increases will help to demonstrate to consumers that real change is underway and that their interests are being supported.</P>
      <P>This is a budget which strikes the right balance between addressing the needs of the economy by helping it to prosper, the needs of those in work, especially those on lower pay, and the needs of those in society who require our support, such as the elderly, the unemployed and young children. It is a budget that reinforces Ireland&rsquo;s position as a leading location in which to do business, a leading location in which to work, and a leading location in which to live and, as I said at the outset, it will prove to be a watershed in the development of our economy and Irish society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to contribute to this very important debate. This is the ninth consecutive budget presented to the people of Ireland by this Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government and is, as I was glad to hear Deputy Kenny admit today, a budget that the Irish people deserve. Over these nine budgets, a clear and focused strategy has been followed, which has positioned this modern republic of ours as a country that is looked up to all over the world. This has all the more significance, as Deputies will be aware, because it is not that long ago that the opposite was the case.</P>
      <P>Now we can hold our heads up proudly, as this nation and its people have a better place to live than ever before, due in no small measure to a Government which has taken the right decisions and created an economic and social climate of promise and opportunity. For the brave men and women who won our independence 85 years ago, such progress would have been hoped for but, in reality, scarcely thought possible. We have come to where we are not by chance but because policies have been implemented which have allowed the Irish people to achieve extraordinary things.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is undoubtedly the longest era of sustained prosperity in our history. We were criticised for it but careful fiscal management has created an economic environment that has attracted investment, practically eliminated unemployment and for the first time in a generation given our people a choice to remain in their own country.</P>
      <P>In my position as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I am continually struck by the extraordinary journey which our country has travelled over the past few years. Less than two decades ago, we were one of the <Col N="179"/>Cinderellas of the EU. Today we are at the top of the 25 and even as traditionally powerful states, such as France and Germany, experience sluggish economic growth, Ireland continues to power forward. For the new member states and for those close to EU accession, we are a perfect role model and a template which they all seek to emulate.</P>
      <P>This budget is a generous, responsible and focused set of provisions which will sustain economic progress while improving the quality of life of all our people. Underlying all that this Government does is a genuine desire to spread our continuing prosperity as evenly as possible and to ensure that policies of fairness and equality, are always pursued.</P>
      <P Just="Left">By protecting and growing the economy through investment in infrastructure, low corporation tax and increased levels of funding for education and training, we have generated the means to target resources where they are most needed. There is no doubt that this is one of the fairest and most socially progressive budgets ever produced by an Irish Government. We have generated the means through prudent economic management and now we are setting about using them.</P>
      <P>We have ticked all the relevant boxes because that is what good and accountable Government is elected to do. We are investing far more in our future, through enhanced capital spending in education at all levels, including a new package to promote innovation in our universities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Budget 2006 introduced a truly innovative package of measures for child care and a big increase in the old age pension, fuel allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance. It increased social welfare rates well ahead of inflation. It will keep those on the minimum wage out of the tax net &mdash; a record 740,000 people. It will keep those on the average industrial wage out of the higher tax rate. It will reform tax reliefs so tax payments more fairly reflect ability to pay. It will freeze indirect taxes and reduce other taxes. It will introduce special reliefs designed to improve our environment and it will relieve the tax and administrative burden on business and on small business in particular.</P>
      <P>Budgets are now generally a challenge for the Opposition. Holes must be found and weaknesses probed. Sometimes these are found and exploited but no amount of verbal ingenuity can mask the frustration of this Opposition, which has been undoubtedly stumped. The best it can come up with in muted response is that it is an election budget. Speaking of elections, it is once again worth reminding the House what things were like when the main Opposition parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, were last elected to Government. This was a time when the economy was on its knees, a real basket case or the poorest of Europe&rsquo;s rich, as we were famously described in 1987. Thankfully, my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, returned to Government that year and set about pulling <Col N="180"/>the country out of the doldrums of the previous five years. Due to utter mismanagement and incompetence, Fine Gael and the Labour Party had presided over a situation where taxes had gone through the roof and inflation was rampant. People were being taxed at 65%. This week Deputy Rabbitte said the highest tax rate was too high&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and that more people should be taken out of the top tax band. That is what the social and morally proper party is looking for. It is bankrupt of ideas.</P>
      <P>Industrial unrest was widespread while our young people were leaving in search of jobs in numbers not seen since the 1950s.</P>
      <P>The facts of history also show that in 1987, faced by an economic wasteland of incompetence and mismanagement, the Taoiseach, the then Minister for Labour, crafted our first social partnership agreement. This first agreement became the template on which stability and prosperity was built and continues to be a crucial aspect of economic and social policy.</P>
      <P>In my 23 years as a Member of this House, I have never heard an Opposition so at sea in its response to a budget. It has been wrong-footed and responded accordingly. We have one more budget to go before we put ourselves before the people and I am confident that when the time arrives, the people will recognise what has been achieved over the previous ten years. It is my great pleasure to commend this budget to this House for its approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The package of increased capital expenditure and tax initiatives announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, yesterday once again demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s success in delivering improved social services and key infrastructure. The announcement of an additional capital provision of &euro;130 million for 2006 and revised capital envelopes for 2006 to 2010 for programmes within the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are very welcome. The Revised Estimate of &euro;2.729 billion for the Department is the biggest ever Government spend on local government, up by 7.9% on the provision for 2005. The total funding available to the Department next year will be &euro;3.608 billion when account is taken of the local government fund, the environment fund and a PPP provision of &euro;20 million, that is, an increase of &euro;236 million or 7%.</P>
      <P>In my area of responsibility, housing, I very much welcome the additional provision of &euro;54 million which, together with the additional &euro;53 million announced in the Abridged Estimates <Col N="181"/>Volume, brings the Exchequer capital provision for housing next year to almost &euro;1.25 billion. This is up 9% on this year&rsquo;s Estimate and is almost double the level of spend five years ago in 2000. The total Exchequer provision between current and capital in the housing budget is &euro;1.37 billion.</P>
      <P>These additional resources will allow us to start 6,000 new units of local authority accommodation, to continue to develop the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and advance affordable housing. New five-year action plans in place at local authority level provide the basis for delivering accelerated programmes in a coherent and integrated fashion.</P>
      <P>Building on our achievements to date, we will outline a new statement of housing policy over the coming days, which will place this investment in a broader housing context. Our focus is on making best use of the resources available to respond to the maximum number of households in need of accommodation. By the end of this year, almost 100,000 households will have been assisted through various housing measures since 1997. Many more will benefit from the increased funding under multi-annual capital programmes announced yesterday. This is further demonstration of our strong commitment to meeting the needs of low income households.</P>
      <P>The Government attaches great importance to social inclusion. While the social and affordable housing programme is the most significant measure available to the Department in this area, the Government has also demonstrated its commitment in recent years through the development of other supporting policies and programmes and the allocation of resources both at national and local level to tackle social exclusion in a real way.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As part of the local government modernisation programme, local authorities have been expanding their role in social inclusion and community development. In recognition of this and to give further impetus to support and strengthen their work in this area, an additional provision of &euro;6 million for social capital is being made available to local authorities. This funding, together with other local authority social inclusion initiatives, means that a total of &euro;20 million will be provided by my Department to support initiatives and programmes in this area in 2006. The Minister, Deputy Roche, will make further announcements in this regard shortly. This &euro;20 million is on top of the &euro;1.25 billion for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a national carbon fund in the Budget Statement with an initial allocation of &euro;20 million. I also welcome the nomination of the National Treasury Management Agency as the purchasing agent for carbon credits on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>Major important heritage properties will benefit as a result of the additional &euro;5 million capital and the tax relief announced in the budget for the Irish Heritage Trust. This is on top of the amount provided in the Abridged Estimates Vol<Col N="182"/>ume for the establishment and initial running costs of this trust.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, there were many good features in yesterday&rsquo;s budget. I look forward, as I am sure the Government does, to delivering on many items which, unfortunately, time does not permit me to go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on budget 2006. What would the main Opposition parties have done differently? What would they have changed if given the opportunity? I listened to Deputy Kehoe rail against lack of planning in education. I remind him and others who are interested that when Senator O&rsquo;Rourke was Minister for Education, Fianna F&aacute;il introduced legislation to recognise the institutes of technology which were then RTCs, while the Dublin Institute of Technology was underpinned with legislation. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, was involved in setting up the National Qualifications Authority. This has grown through the research and development fund which was set up. This budget introduced the strategic innovation fund &mdash; the fourth level about which we speak.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kehoe also talked about primary level. I remind Deputies opposite that they handed over the national finances in good stead but it is very easy to do that when their Minister for Social Welfare gave almost the lowest social welfare increases in the history of the State in his last budget in 1997. That Government had seven school building projects in the country. This year there will 1,200 school building projects.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies opposite that teacher training had been cut back and those of us who were at the coalface talked about something dreamed up by civil servants whereby we could get the odd extra teacher through something called the &ldquo;demographic dividend&rdquo;. The reason was that no teachers were being trained. I will not even attempt to remind the House how many additional teachers are now in our schools as well as special needs assistants and resource teachers. There will be 500 additional primary teachers in our schools in the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>They are needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>It will not wash for anybody to talk about the Government&rsquo;s inability to plan.</P>
      <P>This budget sets out to improve people&rsquo;s lives by helping the most vulnerable groups in our society. Families, children, the less well-off, the sick and the elderly will benefit significantly from this budget. Surely, that is welcome. I hope no Government of any composition would do different.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Deputy English and I had the honour of being involved in drawing up what I believe is the tem<Col N="183"/>plate for the major initiative on early education and child care, which I greatly welcome. Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe was the rapporteur. As long as I am in this House, I will ensure the programme laid out in this document by the National Economic and Social Forum is implemented to the letter and in full over ten years. I compliment Dr. Maureen Gaffney, Professor John Coolahan and the other people in the National Economic and Social Forum.</P>
      <P>In his submission to the Oireachtas committee, Professor Coolahan said the report was realistic and feasible and that a wish list of unrealistic aspirations could have been provided, but that would not have been helpful. He said the proposals are gradual, built on sustained progress, and that the idea is to maintain a sustained pattern reflected in the use of a ten-year plan comprising two five-year slots &mdash; 2005 to 2010 &mdash; with adjustments made to circumstances for the second five years. He said it is believed this target is needed to bring about significant changes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government&rsquo;s announcement today that an executive agency will be set up under the aegis of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to co-ordinate the initiatives in this area. To those who say the additional payment for children under six years of age is not enough, I say this is year one. I read an article today outlining how child care and early education grew in the Reggio-Amelia area of Italy. It started in 1963 and it was only by taking incremental steps in 1971, 1973 and 1980 that it grew the sector of early childhood care and education. It is a pity some of those Members who say they are left-leaning are not around to hear that it is now the envy of countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, France and Sweden. This initiative will go down in history as a hugely significant one.</P>
      <P>Over-regulation must be avoided and that is why I welcome the &euro;10,000 income tax and PRSI disregard for those who wish to look after children, other than their own, in their homes. We must ensure quality and provide enhanced standards but that is not the same hidebound regulation. The package announced by the Minister for Finance and the resources allocated to the strategy are also very welcome. As I said, the &euro;10,000 income tax and PRSI disregard is hugely important.</P>
      <P>Child benefit has been transformed and is now four to five times the value it was in 1997. The new child care cash payment of &euro;1,000 per year for children under six years of age is the equivalent of a &euro;5,000 tax allowance at the standard rate per child. Some &euro;2,800 per child under six years of age will be paid this year. I fully expect this will be built on incrementally. I have no doubt this is feasible and is what families want.</P>
      <P>While experts helped us to understand it, we are putting the child at the centre at long last and are moving away from the notion that we are <Col N="184"/>responding to an economic situation which, of course, we are also doing. However, we are primarily putting children at the centre and ensuring they are given the opportunity to develop. American research has shown that for every dollar invested in early childhood care and education, the rewards reaped are a factor of seven, and 14 in terms of the reduction in costs such as the costs associated with early school leaving, ill health, imprisonment and so on.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the move towards opportunities for parents to remain at home in the first year of their child&rsquo;s life. I warmly compliment the Minister on the way he has grasped the opportunity to extend maternity benefit. He proposes to do in two years what we spoke about doing in four. The extension of parental leave is also hugely important. The mix of such initiatives will make a huge difference.</P>
      <P>Co-ordinating the whole area of child care and early education in one Department will make a difference. That call has been made for some time, including by the Oireachtas committee. I look forward to the day when we have an early education and child care sector which is the envy of the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>The balanced and thorough approach is in response to one obvious fact about child care, that is, that there is no quick-fix, one-size-fits-all solution. If we attempted to tackle the issue in that type of blinkered fashion, we would only insult parents and their children as well as head down the road to failure. This country has been bedevilled by the pilot project syndrome. I am pleased we are adopting a long-term strategy for early childhood education and care in the same way as we adopted a multi-annual, long-term strategy for the disability sector last year and in the same way my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, spoke about the long-term strategy for housing. That is how this country should develop.</P>
      <P>This strategy recognises that parents have differing views about the best type of child care for their children. Some people wish to provide care in the home for a period of time after the birth of a child or for the pre-school years while others wish to use part-time nurseries and cr&egrave;ches while working in the home. Many will wish to place children in the family home setting using the service of family members and neighbours.</P>
      <P>The story underpinning budget 2006 demonstrates once again that the public finances remain strong. This strength has been hard earned and this budget shows that we will maintain a responsible approach to ensure our economy continues to bring real and sustainable improvements in public services, social provision and infrastructure.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was also pleased to see the package dealing with the care of the elderly. There have been significant increases in social welfare pension payments. Naturally, it is gratifying to hear people like Sean Healy of CORI welcome this year&rsquo;s <Col N="185"/>package of measures as going a long way towards meeting targets set out in the national anti-poverty strategy. Older people, like the young, are best cared for in their own home. With the package of measures provided in the budget, that is more possible than ever before. In this budget, we have confirmed our commitment to social inclusion by helping in a real way those who are less well off while at the same time underpinning a very strong economy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness"><NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to the budget debate and the many billions of euro being spent in each Department, it should be easy enough to sort out my problem. I appeal to the Minister in that context, in the hope of finding a solution. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is very much aware of the issue I bring to the House, the plight of the Comerama workers. As we know, the factory closed on 28 November 2002. On 12 December 2002, public representatives from Kilkenny, the unions, workers and officials of the Department met the T&aacute;naiste who gave an unambiguous commitment that the workers would benefit from the improved statutory redundancy being provided for in legislation that was due to be introduced at that time in the House. The shop steward attending the meeting, Eamon Nolan, based on that commitment concerning the legislation, recommended acceptance of the package before them on the basis that they would benefit from further redundancy. The factory was then wound up.</P>
        <P>If the commitment had not been given on that day I have no doubt arrangements could have been put in place to fix a later date for the wind-down of the factory so that the employees could benefit from the legislation due to be introduced and the redundancy which would follow on from that. I accept that a mistake was made at that meeting, in that the proposed legislation could not be applied retrospectively. Given that a shop steward brought the workforce with him and agreed to the closure based on the commitment from the T&aacute;naiste, we have a moral obligation to pay the workforce the &euro;910,000 that would have been due to it. This equates to roughly &euro;10,000 per person.</P>
        <P>As the circumstances of the case are unique, it should be possible to ring-fence that payment. It may be possible for the union to agree to the ring-fencing of that payment to the Comerama workforce through the social partnership process so that this money can be paid to the workforce. Correspondence from various Ministers and the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office addressed the many issues <Col N="186"/>relating to the closure of Comerama but none have addressed the suggestions by the workforce through its union representative, Phil Funchion. It is now time to address these issues and to inform the workforce of the Government&rsquo;s intention.</P>
        <P>The workers met Ministers, most recently the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I have made representations on their behalf, as have all the other Oireachtas representatives from Kilkenny. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle raised the matter in the House some time ago. The correspondence received by Oireachtas Members from SIPTU last week was a truthful recollection of the meeting that took place in which the T&aacute;naiste gave a commitment to the workers. I accept that a mistake may have been made but based on that commitment the workforce took a certain course of action and they should not be penalised for it. The outcome should be the payment of &euro;10,000 each for the Comerama workers.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, was good enough to meet the workforce and listen to their appeals, as well as mine and those of other Oireachtas Members on many occasions in this House. I urge him to try to find a way to fulfil the commitment given by the unions so the payment can be ring-fenced and made to the workers. If a way can be found to ring-fence this money the political will is there to ensure the payments are made. I urge the Minister to look favourably on the case made in recent weeks by the union, SIPTU, and the workers involved at this time of goodwill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this matter on the Adjournment. He has been very sincere in tenaciously pursuing this issue in recent years. I recognise that other Deputies have done likewise and discussed it with me. The matter has been raised in this House on a number of occasions.</P>
        <P>From the outset, I wish to state that neither I nor my predecessor have ever given any commitment to the former workforce at Comerama in respect of their entitlements under the redundancy payments legislation enacted in 2003. On 12 December 2002, following the announcement of the closure of the Comerama factory with a loss of more than 160 jobs, the T&aacute;naiste, together with officials of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment met a SIPTU delegation representing the Comerama workers. As I understand from the official minutes of that meeting, the main concern of the workers, many, if not most of whom, had already been made redundant, was that if a deal on enhanced redundancy rates was made under the partnership process, it should be retrospective with regard to the workers concerned. In this context the T&aacute;naiste gave an undertaking to do everything she could to ensure that the Comerama workers would get <Col N="187"/>the retrospection. This undertaking was recorded in the official note of the meeting prepared by the official attending as follows:</P>
        <P LI="1">An T&aacute;naiste said that talks were on going in relation to the Statutory Redundancy issue. She gave an undertaking that if the legislation is changed she would do everything she could to ensure that the Comerama workers would be included in any amendment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">At the time neither the T&aacute;naiste nor the officials attending the meeting were aware of the legal principle established by the courts that the Legislature cannot impose retrospective financial obligations on employers, or indeed anybody else. This was subsequently confirmed in legal advice given to my Department. The legal advice from the Attorney General was that: (i) The enhanced statutory redundancy payments require legislation to be enacted in order to be brought into effect, and; (ii) As the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. In fact, employers are entitled to due notice, usually about two months, of the intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates.</P>
        <P>This legal position was communicated to the Comerama workers. Both the T&aacute;naiste and I very much regret, therefore, that it was not possible to apply the new legislative provisions on enhanced redundancy payments to the Comerama workers or any other workers with retrospective effect after the new provisions came into effect in May 2003. The factual position in regard to the former workers of Comerama is that 154 of them had been made redundant long before the new rates of redundancy came into effect. As I understand it, they received substantially more than the then statutory rate in settlement with the company. Some 13 workers, who were made redundant by the liquidator of the company since May 2003, have been paid the new enhanced statutory rates from the social insurance fund by the Department. However, these amounts were less than the settlements received by the 154 workers who were made redundant before the company went into liquidation and received <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>
        <P>Subsequently, at the request of the T&aacute;naiste, two officials of this Department met a delegation of workers and union representatives at the factory premises in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny on Monday, 23 June 2003, to discuss the situation regarding the new rates of statutory redundancy in regard to the employees of the company, who were made redundant in December 2002 and January 2003. The union officials and the workers&rsquo; representatives spoke at the meeting. They made the case that the workers who had already been made redundant up to January 2003 before the new enhanced rates came into force in May 2003 should be retrospectively paid these enhanced rates. However, on a voluntary basis, <Col N="188"/>the company had already paid these workers about 3.2 times the then statutory rate. The two officials who travelled to Castlecomer were told by the Comerama workers that they had, at the time of their negotiations with their employer on redundancy terms, been prepared to accept, in final settlement of their redundancy claim, the 60% rebate the employer was entitled to claim and receive from the SIF. It is quite clear that no one, save the employer has any say in what he does with the 60% refund paid from the SIF, which he has claimed and to which he was legally entitled.</P>
        <P>The case was also made on behalf of these workers that if it was not legally possible to meet their claim for payment of the enhanced rates, the Government should consider bringing a scheme to the Oireachtas to enable them to be paid the enhanced rates from the SIF, as a special case. This proposal was brought to the attention of the T&aacute;naiste and actively considered but was ultimately deemed impractical. It would mean making a special case for the workers concerned on the basis that they had missed out by being made redundant quite a while before the new enhanced rates were passed by the Oireachtas into law. Many thousands of other workers are in a similar position and could make a case for special treatment. Unfortunately, for the workers concerned, my Department is precluded from paying the enhanced rates of redundancy with retrospective effect. Suggestions were made regarding the utilisation of the national implementation body in this matter. The role of that body is to ensure delivery of the stability and peace provisions of Sustaining Progress. As the redundancy element of Sustaining Progress contains no provisions regarding retrospection, the national implementation body has no role in this matter.</P>
        <P>Of those made redundant, 150 attended for interviews with F&Aacute;S. Subsequently, 136 people were called for training and 98 of these attended. Most of this training took place between February and June 2003. Some further training was provided for a total of 35 individuals. Training was completed in 2003 and at that time, F&Aacute;S records indicated that 50% of the workforce who had engaged with F&Aacute;S on training programmes had progressed to employment.</P>
        <P>There have been numerous representations made on this matter both to me and to my predecessor, and, over the past two and a half years, a large number of parliamentary questions have been tabled with regard to the Comerama workers. Notwithstanding this, the position has not altered. The payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers and cannot be imposed on them with retrospective effect. There are no legal provisions for making additional payments from the public purse to the 154 workers or those made redundant by the liquidator.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that everything possible was done to ensure that the Comerama workers got their <Col N="189"/>full redundancy entitlements and that no commitment was given, nor could one be given, to retrospectively enhance statutory redundancy payments. I met the unions some time ago and recently discussed with my officials all the issues raised at that meeting, in particular, the issue of ringfencing. I do not consider it possible to facilitate the award of redundancy payments to one set of workers without extending them to everybody else made redundant before the new enhanced rates were introduced. I acknowledge the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns but hope that people equally acknowledge the issues facing the Government on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryCowleyIND"><NameTxt>Dr. Cowley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment debate. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food to intervene to save the jobs of 100 people who work or, I should say, used to work, in his Department in Davitt House, County Mayo, who are being forced to move to Portlaoise or deploy to alternative employment in the Garda&rsquo;s PULSE system. However, these are no substitutes for their former jobs. It beggars belief that people already decentralised to County Mayo are now being forced to transfer to Portlaoise. The Government constantly raises the importance of decentralisation but this group, which is already decentralised, is being forced to return to the centre. It is a desperate, difficult and scandalous situation.</P>
        <P>The alternative employment being offered in County Mayo represents no choice because it is completely different and involves shift work. People are being offered 25% extra as an incentive to move to shift work, but that is a poor substitute for the loss of existing terms and conditions, which is what this amounts to. The other option is to work as a driver tester, but that is a laugh because, even after spending six weeks in training in Dublin, the contract will end in 18 months.</P>
        <P>Morale is at an all time low in Davitt House in Castlebar, County Mayo, and justice demands that the Minister intervenes immediately in this terrible situation. Of the 100 people concerned, 16 have opted for the PULSE system but they will be working shifts which include weekends and nights. The incentive is 25%, whereas 40% can be earned in the private sector. It is certainly not an equal situation and, in addition, they are losing their terms and conditions.</P>
        <P>While people are being forced to think about transferring to Portlaoise, many will not go. People will lose their jobs in County Mayo, which will be to Portlaoise&rsquo;s gain because 80 temporary people will have to be employed there to substitute for the work of the Castlebar staff. That sounds like a recentralisation rather than a decentralisation programme. With 16 people having undergone PULSE training, 84 are left in this desperate situation. While decentralisation has <Col N="190"/>been a disaster, it does not make sense to take the people concerned from County Mayo when they are willing and prepared to work there.</P>
        <P>County Mayo has suffered greatly. The mid-term review of the national development plan revealed underspending in the county. The county airport is seeking &euro;15 million for the years 2005-07. We are being left without these resources. The western corridor has a deficit in spending of &euro;200 million, although all we needed was &euro;365. People are talking about these matters. Agriculture is winding down and industrial jobs are going to China and elsewhere. The few jobs we have as a result of decentralisation are also being taken away.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to address the issue because, even after today&rsquo;s budget, the situation in County Mayo has not improved. My area continues to lack an ambulance base, despite the minimum requirement of a base every 20 miles. The other night, my colleague, a GP, had difficulties in finding an ambulance for a man whose eyes had all but burned out of his head. However, he could not locate one because only two ambulances are available for the entire county. It is the third largest county in Ireland, with a population of 120,000, yet this doctor could not find an ambulance in a hurry. The patient concerned had to travel from County Mayo because there is no eye unit in Mayo General Hospital.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to intervene in the situation concerning the Department of Agriculture and Food. It is important that the county retains whatever jobs it has and I hope that he will respond in some way to this plea.</P>

	<P>The introduction of the single payment system, SPS, brought about a reduced workload for Department of Agriculture and Food staff in Castlebar previously involved with headage and livestock premia payments. The work concerned with the single payment scheme is in the process of being centralised to Portlaoise. At present, there are approximately 135 staff in the Castlebar office and, while they have been assisting with the roll-out of the SPS, approximately 100 will need to be redeployed to other work in the near future.</P>
        <P>At the outset I want to state clearly that none of my Department&rsquo;s staff in Castlebar has been forced to go to Portlaoise and none will be made redundant. However, to assist with the delivery of the single payment scheme, volunteers from my Department&rsquo;s local offices, including Castlebar, were asked to transfer temporarily to Portlaoise and were paid the appropriate travel and subsistence rates.</P>
        <P>My Department, together with the Department of Finance and other Departments, is working to identify opportunities for redeployment of our Castlebar staff to other work. Given that my Department now finds itself in a situation where it is experiencing staff surpluses, this will inevit<Col N="191"/>ably mean transferring staff to fill vacancies in other Departments. At all times, they will continue to be employed as civil servants on the same terms and conditions that they currently hold. There are no proposals to relocate any staff to a town or location other than where they are currently based. The only exception will be where staff volunteer to transfer to another location.</P>
        <P>My Department is pursuing a number of different strategies to provide our staff in Castlebar with a number of options in the short and medium term. One option open to staff is to transfer to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Castlebar. That Department, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, has established the Garda information services centre, GISC, which will perform some administrative functions for the Garda. This centre will be situated in Michael Davitt House and, when fully rolled out, will have a staffing complement of 161 people. While the majority of staff in GISC will be required to work on a shift basis, there are about 40 positions within the centre where staff will continue to work on a normal day basis and these are being reserved for Department of Agriculture and Food staff based in Castlebar. The transfer of staff to shift work will be on a voluntary basis. With regard to the provision for training for civil servants, the Garda has specifically developed a month-long full training programme for administrative staff working in GISC.</P>
        <P>Additional possible options may include transferring to other Departments based in Castlebar and my Department has been in contact with these Departments to pursue this matter. A number of staff in Castlebar have applied to move to other locations in County Mayo under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme. Accordingly, my Department has had discussions with the Department of Finance and other Departments on the possibility of advancing the plans of Departments which are decentralising to County Mayo.</P>

      <sTitle>Asylum Applications.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to discuss the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain why Afghan nationals seeking asylum in Ireland are being refused. The Minister of State may be aware that approximately 120 Afghans arrived outside Leinster House two days ago to protest at the manner in which they have been treated in terms of the asylum process. It brought to light that there seems to be almost 100% rejection of applications for asylum by Afghan nationals. It is perplexing how this situation should arise because anyone who knows anything about what is going on in the world would know without access to specialist information that Afghanistan is a war zone, that it has been devas<Col N="192"/>tated by the Taliban, al-Qaeda, United States troops and indigenous warlords.</P>
        <P>Afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world. It sends a great amount of illegal drugs to this country and many people there are in danger of prosecution and of losing their lives. It is strange to think that the Government should reject virtually every case that comes before it of an Afghan national seeking the protection of the Government under the Geneva Convention.</P>
        <P>When the matter was raised in the D&aacute;il recently by Deputy Joe Higgins, the Taoiseach said that the Irish immigration system is transparent and that if the Afghan nationals did not think they were getting a fair hearing, the Taoiseach was certain they were. In fact the asylum system is not transparent or accountable. Under the current system, a person puts an application before the Refugee Applications Commissioner. If refused, the person can go to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. That body is unaccountable. It never publishes any reason it refused an application. It is well known in the Bar that of the 35 members of the tribunal who hear appeals, some boast about the fact that they have never let a non-national through. That is not what I regard as a very accountable or transparent appeals mechanism.</P>
        <P>Following on that, there are grounds for humanitarian appeal. That is at the discretion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who accepts or rejects it. We have seen already that the Minister does not even read the appeals, but nods through whatever is approved by his officials. We have a system which is slow, cumbersome and anything but transparent and accountable. For some reason, some people in the Department have got it in their heads that with regard to this system, Afghanistan is a safe and secure country. As a result, they simply refuse the applications. That is outrageous. People should not be sent home willy-nilly to a country where they will undoubtedly be persecuted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At this moment a protest is taking place outside the Garda national immigration bureau against the proposed deportation of Nigerian and Algerian nationals. I am aware of one Nigerian involved, Abdel Karim Aissiou, who has spent five years in this country and is an aged-out minor who went to O&rsquo;Connell School in my constituency and is preparing for his applied leaving certificate. He has now spent 46 days in prison in Ireland, although he was in direct provision in a hostel, because it was alleged he had not responded to a deportation order. He had spent all his life in a hostel, so the authorities knew precisely where he was. Now, after five years and after receiving an Irish education, he is told he is being deported. Dozens of other people are in the same situation.</P>
        <P>That is not a transparent or accountable system. Specifically, I would like to see some <Col N="193"/>meaningful response with regard to the Afghan nationals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Costello for raising this issue and I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.</P>
        <P>It is important that I preface my remarks by pointing out that it has been the policy of successive Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not to comment on individual asylum applications or categories of asylum claims from particular nationalities. That said, there are two fundamental principles underlying the asylum process. First, when asylum seekers come here and seek our protection, their cases are fairly and independently examined, and second, a deportation process, after a person&rsquo;s case has been dealt with fairly and subject to the relevant statutory safeguards, is central to the proper running of any immigration and asylum system.</P>
        <P>The definition of a refugee is set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act 1996. Subject to certain exceptions, including where persons may be excluded from refugee status on security related grounds, that definition is:</P>
        <P LI="1">A person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself (or herself) of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The task therefore for the independent refugee determination agencies in the case of each individual asylum seeker is to determine whether, following investigation, he or she is deemed to come within the terms of that definition on the basis of all the information which is gleaned.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, under the Refugee Act 1996, two independent statutory offices were established to consider applications or appeals in respect of refugee status and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. These offices are the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The UNHCR is given full access to the refugee determination process and can examine any case at any time to ensure that fair procedures and our Geneva Convention obligations are complied with.</P>
        <P>Every asylum application is considered on its merits. Every asylum applicant is guaranteed an investigation and determination of his or her claim at first instance by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. Following each interview, an assessment is made of the core elements relating to the case. Consideration is given to the sub<Col N="194"/>jective and objective elements of the application. The subjective element of an asylum application concerns the applicant&rsquo;s individual circumstances as they are perceived and described by him or her. The objective element of the application concerns the relevant country of origin information which comes from a wide variety of sources, including information from organisations such as the UNHCR, Amnesty International, Canadian boards of immigration and other EU member states as well as media and Internet sources. In addition to these periodically updated sources, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal have access to up-to-date news reports regarding events and developments in the countries concerned.</P>
        <P>The assessment carried out includes determining whether an applicant has a well founded fear of persecution, whether the persecution is related to a Geneva Convention reason, whether the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to his or her own country, what internal protection alternative, if any, might be available within his or her own country, as well as credibility issues, which are always extremely important to consider.</P>
        <P>Every asylum applicant is guaranteed a right of appeal to a statutorily independent and separate body, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Every asylum applicant is also guaranteed access to legal assistance provided by the Refugee Legal Service.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of section 17(1) of the Refugee Act 1996, the final decision in respect of an asylum application is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform based on the recommendation of the commissioner or the decision of the tribunal. However, under the legislative scheme of things the Minister is obliged, save in very exceptional circumstances, to accept a recommendation that a person should be given refugee status. Such a decision is made by the Minister as soon as possible following receipt of the relevant papers from the commissioner of the tribunal, as appropriate.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Asylum applications from Afghanistan amounted to 24 in 2003, 106 in 2004 and 133 in 2005 to date. After, as I have indicated, a fair and comprehensive determination process at first instance in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, there were 25 grant recommendations in the period 2003 to 2005 to date. This compares to 166 refusals during the same period. At appeals stage in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the number of Afghan nationals granted refugee status was 14 in the period 2003 to date. The number refused status at appeals stage was 44 during the same period.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a person who has failed the asylum process and who has been refused refugee status in the State is informed in writing that it is proposed to make a deportation <Col N="195"/>order and that person is given the following options: to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons he or she should not be deported, to voluntarily leave the State or to consent to deportation.</P>
        <P>Following consideration of each case under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a decision is taken whether to deport or to grant temporary leave to remain in the State. Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, requires the Minister to consider 11 factors, including representations received by or on behalf of the person, family and domestic circumstances, employment prospects and so on, in deciding whether to make a deportation order or to grant temporary leave to remain in the State.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The safety of returning a person, or <i>refoulement</i> as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a <Col N="196"/>deportation order. This means a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in the opinion of the Minister, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform uses extensive country of origin information, drawn from different independent sources, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, in evaluating the safety of making returns to third countries.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied that the procedures followed in all cases ensure all asylum requests are considered in a comprehensive and fair manner.</P>

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>I fully support the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>In this context I wrote to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos <Col N="198"/>Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. In his reply the Commissioner outlined that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU. The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The level of interest by Irish farmers in growing genetically modified crops would be determined by, among other factors, the range of GM crops available for sowing and their suitability for Irish conditions. Currently, the only genetically modified crops which are on the EU common catalogue of plant varieties and thereby authorised for cultivation on an EU-wide basis are a series of GM maize varieties which are resistant to the European cornborer. These particular crops are of little or no interest to Irish farmers as the cornborer is not an indigenous pest here. However, in the event that other GM varieties are developed that would confer an economic advantage to Irish agriculture and if they were to be authorised for cultivation within the EU, undoubtedly such varieties will be evaluated and their cultivation here considered. GM potato varieties with resistance to late blight and oilseed rape varieties with higher oil content are in development internationally and these and others might be of interest to Irish farmers in the medium term, should they be approved for cultivation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The growing of GM crops is determined by EU legislation adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. This legislation, which is binding on all member states, stipulates that EU farmers should be able to engage in the production types they wish, be it conventional, organic or GM, provided they do not impose a necessity on neighbouring farmers to change their established production types. This brings in the concept of co-existence of GM crops alongside non-GM crops. Creating conditions for co-exist<Col N="199"/>ence means making it possible for conventional and organic farmers to keep the adventitious presence of GMOs in their crops below the labelling thresholds established in Community law, while ensuring that farmers, who want to grow authorised GM crops, have a reasonable opportunity to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In August 2003 an interdepartmental group, which comprised representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Teagasc and the EPA, was established to examine issues relating to co-existence and draw up rules for co-existence arrangements in Ireland.</P>
        <P>I have recently received and examined the group&rsquo;s reports and recommendations. The report takes on board the full range of factors surrounding the GM issue: the principles laid down in the Commission guidelines on GM co-existence; Government policy on GMOs; scientific issues; new developments in GM technology; the Irish crop production system and farm infrastructure; and liability. While the group engaged extensively with identified stakeholders, I have decided, in order to allow all concerned put forward their views on the proposed arrangements for co-existence, to place the report on my Department&rsquo;s website and invite further observations on the recommendations in the report. I will take all such observations into account before putting in place co-existence arrangements in Ireland, as is required under EU legislation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The position is that, over the past year, meetings of the single payment advisory committee, comprising representatives of my Department, the farming organisations and Teagasc, were held on a number of occasions to discuss the rules governing the allocation of entitlements from the national reserve. At more recent meetings, the committee assessed progress on processing the national reserve applications and discussed, in particular, what should constitute the &ldquo;regional average value of entitlements&rdquo;. Under the regulations governing the national reserve, allocations to farmers who are successful under certain categories must not have the effect of increasing their entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements.</P>
        <P>My officials subsequently sought clarification on certain issues from the European Commission and I will shortly be taking final decisions on the matter. The intention is that allocations will be <Col N="200"/>made to successful applicants early in the new year.</P>

	<P>The Fourth Annual World Food Technology and Innovation Forum was held in Dublin by Access Events International in partnership with Enterprise Ireland on 9-10 November 2005. The event provided an excellent opportunity for food manufacturers to discuss the changing dynamics of the industry and to cover the themes of consumer trends and developments in new product development; approaches to innovation and well-being; nutrition and health labelling; trends in ingredients; and futuristic technologies such as nanotechnology and how these may be applied to the food industry, and progress in functional food research.</P>
        <P>The topics echo the emphasis placed by the National Development Plan 2000-2006 on research and development as a key driver of economic development and growth and the allocation in the plan of &euro;106 million to research, technology and development in the food sector alone. This comprises public good food research under FIRM, my Department&rsquo;s food institutional research measure, and grant assistance by Enterprise Ireland for commercial research in the food sector.</P>
        <P>The main objectives of the food institutional research measure, FIRM, are to provide a base of information and expertise in generic technologies that supports innovation and product development in the food industry, and assists consumer protection by ensuring that product development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality. Since 2000 calls for projects have issued on a range of themes: development of technologies to build a more competitive, innovative, consumer-focused and sustainable food production and marketing sector; development of the scientific knowledge to underpin effective food safety practices at all stages in the food chain; consumer foods technology; innovation in functional foods; cheese diversification; production of new food ingredients; nutrition; and new technologies for added-value meat products.</P>
        <P>The emphasis placed on competitive excellence and co-operation between research institutions has greatly increased capacity and capability in third level food research in Ireland and has provided a cadre of highly skilled researchers as a resource for the food sector as well as generating new knowledge and technologies for the food industry.</P><Col N="201"/>
        <P>The initiatives to encourage research and development, which have been implemented by Enterprise Ireland under the national development plan, include research and technology, research and development capability programmes and innovation partnerships with industry and academia. I was particularly pleased to see the interest shown by large dairy and meat companies in the past year in establishing their own research and development centres of excellence with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The development of the functional foods industry has been identified as a national priority by the Government and is specifically mentioned in recommendations of the Agri 2010 and Agri-Vision 2015 committees and the Ahead of the Curve report of the enterprise strategy group. Functional foods are defined as those foods and beverages that provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition, for example, probiotic yogurts for gut intestinal health and energy drinks for sports and general physical performance. It is one of the key areas identified in the Enterprise Ireland development strategy for the value-added food sector, which also includes market-led innovation, biotechnology and functional foods. This sector presents huge challenges and opportunities. Enterprise Ireland has constituted a national functional foods forum that will help formulate and drive the strategy for the sector. The forum enjoys participation from industry, the research-academic community and some industry representative groups as well as Bord Bia and my own Department.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Biotechnology also offers opportunities for new products and process technologies including the creation of a new generation high value food ingredients by extracting high value fractions from raw materials such as milk protein. This is an area also benefiting from State-funded research.</P>
        <P>Market driven innovation is seen to be the key to success in the extremely competitive, rapidly changing, food sector and to positioning the food industry, and indeed other industry sectors, as stated in Ahead of the Curve. While innovation can profitably be applied to all aspects of a company&rsquo;s operations, particular emphasis needs to be placed on commercially exploitable research and development and new product development. I am committed to encouraging and promoting initiatives in this area.</P>

	<P>Public interest in all aspects of gardening is widening all the time and the annual value of the Irish amenity and gardening market is estimated to be worth as much as &euro;450 million. Any initiatives to encourage greater gardening activity and increased consumption of fruit and vegetables are welcome, on the basis of their contribution to good physical and mental health as well as on the economic level.</P>
        <P>That said, the mission of my Department is to contribute to the development of a competitive commercial horticulture and potato sector and the highest food safety and phytosanitary standards. The schemes administered by the Department ensure that seeds and plants, pesticides and fertilisers on sale to the public meet the highest EU specifications.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department is also participating in the funding of a &euro;100,000 programme to promote,<i> inter alia</i>, public awareness of garden related issues and to improve the availability of quality information for the novice gardener. The programme is being managed by Bord Bia and will be 50% funded by the European Commission, 20% funded by the Department and 30% funded by trade interests. In order to encourage gardening among the target audience &mdash; women aged between 35 and 55, and new home owners &mdash; Bord Bia has prepared 20 user-friendly gardening leaflets covering a wide range of topics and designed to encourage novice gardeners to increase gardening activities. Over 400,000 leaflets are currently being distributed to garden centres throughout the country.</P>

	<P>The compensation package in question has a potential value for Ireland of over &euro;300 million. I am satisfied that this represents the best possible deal that could have been for Irish stakeholders in the circumstances.</P>
        <P>The increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments, is worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years. There is also a once-off payment worth almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland. There is an aid package of up to &euro;145 million for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, the restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</P>
        <P>The formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. Pending the adoption of the relevant regulations it is not possible to give further definitive information but, as with the earlier phases of CAP reform, my Department will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course.</P>

	<P>I am always prepared to facilitate trade in live sheep, which is subject to EU rules governing intra-Community trade. Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of Council Directive 91/68/EEC, as amended, as regards reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats.</P>
        <P>These controls as they currently stand provide, as a minimum requirement, that breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export and that no sheep or goats had been introduced on to the holding in the 21 days prior to export. Slaughter sheep must also be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export and are also subject to a &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; period of 21 days prior to dispatch during which no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding of origin.</P>
        <P Just="Left"><?oasys _dc14- ?>These controls were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001 and came into effect on 1 July 2004. I was very much aware that there were certain difficulties with these certification requirements arising from the fact that the information in respect of which the official veterinarian was being required to certify could only be truly known to the farmer. Accordingly I had my Department raise the matter with <Col N="204"/>the European Commission in an effort to arrive at a certification procedure that best meets the concerns of farmers and exporters, while, at the same time, protecting animal health. I am pleased that, in response to our approach, the European Commission submitted proposals to amend these certification requirements to allow the official veterinarian to issue certification based on a written declaration by the farmer or on an examination of the flock register and movement documents. The proposals providing for these new arrangements were agreed to unanimously by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 11 November 2005 and will apply from 15 February 2006. I am confident that they will resolve most of the outstanding difficulties in relation to certification of exports of sheep to France and the United Kingdom.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>While I am happy to facilitate live sheep exports in any way I can, I would point out that securing outlets and the supply and availability of transport for the carriage of livestock is a commercial matter not within the remit of my Department.</P>

	<P>Beef production is extremely valuable to the Irish economy with a &euro;1.4 billion export value representing almost 25% of total Irish agri-food exports. Most of our beef exports to date this year have been to EU markets. EU consumption is predicted to again outstrip production in 2005 with a resulting import gap of an estimated 370,000 tonnes for the year. This will provide opportunities for our beef exports in the high value continental EU markets.</P>
        <P>Our aim is to consolidate our position in the EU market and in this regard, last September I launched the Bord Bia Irish Beef in Europe campaign which is aimed at building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets and to establish the Irish Beef brand firmly in the minds of consumers. This particular campaign involves on-pack promotions in 8,000 European stores which are frequented by some 40 million shoppers every week. I also participated in one of the on-site supermarket promotions in Italy in October. Initial feedback is already encouraging in terms of improved demand in response to the promotion. This promotional work by Bord Bia coupled with the marketing effort of the industry will be continued in order to build further sustainable market share in Europe which is where the future long-term success of the Irish beef industry lies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding third country trade, my Department in co-operation with the Department of Foreign <Col N="205"/>Affairs and Bord Bia, continues to make every effort to increase the number of markets for Irish beef. Russia, Algeria and Egypt are important markets for our beef while the Lebanon is an importer of live cattle. A delegation from my Department and Bord Bia visited Egypt in August this year to finalise negotiations in this area with the Egyptian authorities. This resulted in the signing of a new protocol on animal health matters to improve the conditions under which exports to that country can take place. To date 1,900 tonnes of beef have been shipped to this destination under the new arrangements. Similar work is ongoing in relation to potential opportunities for trade with countries in the Gulf states, South Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines and other potential markets in which there are restrictions on Irish and EU beef due to BSE.</P>
        <P>I am committed to having the maximum number of international markets available to Irish beef and my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve that aim.</P>

	<P>Consumers are entitled to and should be provided with full information on foodstuffs. In this context, my Department continues to give considerable attention to food labelling.</P>
        <P>Given the complexities involved, with account having to be taken of EU legislation and the Single Market, a food labelling group was established in 2002 to examine the matter in detail. Since then, my Department has pursued assiduously the implementation of the recommendations of the food labelling group. Nineteen of the 21 recommendations, many of which were beyond the remit of my Department and some which were to be activated only after others had been completed, have been addressed. The remaining two recommendations, which relate to aspects of origin labelling, are also being addressed.</P>
        <P>Arising from the implementation of the group&rsquo;s recommendations, the enforcement of all food labelling regulations has been centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI. This not only streamlines the enforcement measures but it also provides a one-stop shop for any complaints on mislabelling of food. In addition, the responsibility for food labelling policy, with the exception of fish, has been assigned to the Department of Health and Children and my Department in accordance with another recommendation of the food labelling group. Accordingly, the Department of Health and Children is responsible for <Col N="206"/>general labelling regulations which require information on food labels to be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer. My Department is responsible for more detailed legislation on the labelling of specific food products including beef and poultry meat.</P>
        <P>I am currently in the process of extending the existing beef labelling laws to require information on the &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; of beef to be provided to all consumers in the restaurant and catering sectors. The various representative bodies including the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the two vintners groups, following discussions with my Department, have all agreed to recommend to their members to provide this information to their customers on a voluntary basis in advance of the mandatory legal requirement. It is expected that the voluntary code will be in place in the near future.</P>
        <P>Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant; and, where imported from a third country, an indication of country of origin.</P>
        <P>There are no specific EU regulations governing the labelling of pigmeat or sheepmeat beyond the general food labelling regulations which do not require &ldquo;country of origin&rdquo; information. However, I intend to pursue further the question of labelling of other meats at EU level.</P>
        <P>There has also been a lot of concern expressed about products imported into the Community and then processed in some way allowing it to be described as a product of that member state. This is known as &ldquo;substantial transformation&rdquo; in the context of European customs regulations. Accordingly, any changes in this regard would have to be made with the agreement of the other member states. My Department is continuing to pursue the matter in the context of a general review of food labelling being conducted by the EU Commission.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for energy policy and is primarily responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels.</P>
        <P>The development of the biofuels industry is a cross-sectoral issue impinging on several policy <Col N="207"/>areas, for example, environmental and fiscal policy as well as energy policy, and involving several Departments and agencies. My Department has been represented on a number of interdepartmental groups considering the issue and there has also been direct contact between my Department and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>I am conscious of the central role that agriculture can play in supplying the necessary raw materials for the production of biofuels. Energy crops such as oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet can be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels. Forestry by-products are a rich source of wood biomass for heat or energy generation while various farming by-products such as meat and bone meal and tallow can be used for energy-heat generation and biodiesel manufacture respectively.</P>
        <P>For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, my Department in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will have to be demand led and production by farmers will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. The scheme announced earlier this year by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects has stimulated the production of oilseed rape for biofuel. The announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s budget of the major extension of this scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year should further stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This is a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>The exploitation of wood resources for energy purposes, mainly for heat or electricity generation, offers significant potential. There are also significant opportunities for using by-products of farming and food processing for bioenergy purposes. Approximately 140,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal is produced annually and its use in place of fossil fuels could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19%.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to encourage further research to assist the development of the biofuels industry. Teagasc has already done some valuable work in this area and I also arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department&rsquo;s research stimulus programme. Details of the successful projects will be announced shortly.</P>

        <P>EU legislation on the cultivation of GM crops, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council and which is binding on all member states, specifically prohibits the unilateral declaration of a GM free country. There are, however, options available to restrict the growing of GM crops within regions of a country. One option is the concept of voluntarily developed GM free regions &mdash; a concept being explored by a number of regional communities and authorities throughout the Community. Another option is to seek a derogation from the Commission that, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, co-existence is not possible in certain regions in respect of certain named crops. The cultivation of these crops can then be legitimately prohibited if the case made is accepted by the Commission.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 26, 30, 37, 48, 59, 88, 90, 101, 181 and 182 together.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to achieving a balanced outcome between the various elements of the WTO negotiations. In so far as agriculture is concerned, the outcome of the negotiations will determine the levels of protection and support which the EU may provide for the duration of the next agreement. The negotiations represent, therefore, a serious challenge to the future of the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP. My over-riding objective is to ensure that the terms of the final agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the CAP. More specifically, my priorities are to ensure that: the phasing out of all forms of export subsidies, including export credits, will be applied in parallel as provided for under the WTO framework agreement which was concluded in August 2004, that the phasing-out arrangements will be as flexible as possible and that the end-date will extend as long as possible; Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural exports will remain competitive in the EU market through the continuation of adequate levels of tariff protection on imports from third countries. My aim is to secure the best combination of tariff cuts and the &lsquo;sensitive product&rsquo; status, to which lower tariff cuts will apply, for the products of particular interest to Ireland, especially milk and beef products; the EU&rsquo;s system of direct payments which, following decoupling, qualify as non trade-distorting, will continue to be exempt from reductions under the new agreement; and direct payments make a major contribution to farm incomes in Ireland and I will strongly resist any attempt to amend the qualifying criteria to undermine their status as non-trade-distorting payments under a new agreement.</P>
        <P>The Commission negotiates in the WTO on the basis of a mandate which was agreed by the Council of Ministers. The mandate is designed to defend the CAP as it has evolved under successive reforms, including Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review. Together with a number of my EU ministerial colleagues, I have been very active in demanding that the Commission remains within its mandate and makes no further concessions on agriculture. At a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 October 2005 which I attended, the Council again endorsed the mandate and confirmed that it constitutes the limits for the EU&rsquo;s negotiating brief in the WTO. The Commission maintains that the latest EU offer which was made on 28 October fully respects the negotiating mandate. I have some reservations in this regard, particularly in relation to domestic support and market access <Col N="211"/>issues. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that the efforts of my colleagues and I have ensured that no further concessions have been made by the Commission and that the opposition of member states to further concessions has been conveyed in very clear terms to the negotiating partners. I believe, however, that the Commission has reached the limit of its room to manoeuvre and I recognise that extreme vigilance is needed to protect our interests as the negotiations proceed.</P>
        <P>I have been in regular contact with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development in recent months. I discussed the WTO agriculture negotiations and Irish concerns in relation thereto at a bilateral meeting with the Commissioner on 23 June 2005. The Council of Agriculture Ministers, which reviews the situation on a regular basis, discussed the developments in the negotiations at its meetings on 18 July 2005, 19 September 2005, 25 October and 22 November 2005, all of which I attended with Ministers from other member states and the Commissioner. On each occasion I outlined my concerns that the Commission should continue to adhere to the mandate on agriculture which was given to it by the Council and that it should not deviate from this as the negotiations proceed.</P>
        <P>In November, I also travelled to Geneva for a meeting with Pascal Lamy, the Director General of the WTO, at which I took the opportunity of making it very clear to him where Ireland&rsquo;s concerns lie in relation to the agri-food sector.</P>
        <P>From the development perspective the EU is aiming for a very ambitious outcome to the current negotiations. I have fully supported and will continue to support the EU proposals in this regard which include a commitment to special and differential treatment for developing countries in the form of lower reduction commitments and longer implementation periods, immediate duty free and quota free access to developed country markets for all products from least developed countries as provided for already by the EU through the Everything But Arms initiative and a comprehensive aid for trade package including a broad financial envelope which compensates for possible loss of preferences by least developed countries.</P>
        <P>It is now likely that the negotiations in Hong Kong will be a further step in progress towards a decision rather than a final agreement. I will be attending these negotiations and I will be taking a very active role in pursuing an outcome which is the most beneficial for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 74 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish dairy industry continues to contribute very substantially to the national economy, with an output value of some &euro;2.3 billion and exports of &euro;1.86 billion last year. This year exports are again performing very well despite adjustments to market management supports brought about by the implementation of the Luxembourg Agreement on the reform of the CAP.</P>
        <P>The Commission market management policy has been too aggressive at times and I have frequently challenged the Commission and have raised the matter at the Council of Ministers. In enlisting the support of many other member states for my point of view, I believe the Commission policy has moderated in recent times, now having closer regard to the market implications of its actions rather than its previous emphasis on budgetary policy.</P>
        <P>While acknowledging that some adjustment in market management measures is warranted if the Luxembourg Agreement is to be implemented in full, my concern has been to ensure that the transition is implemented in a more measured way. Sustained downward pressure on market supports would effectively reduce our international competitiveness and put pressure on our ability to fully exploit opportunities to export milk products to international markets. A longer period in which to make the necessary adjustment will instead provide a more solid platform on which to build new market opportunities while consolidating our position in existing markets.</P>
        <P>The stability prevailing in producer prices over recent times is welcome and the direct payment, amounting to &euro;120 million this year, rising to &euro;180 million next year, as compensation for the reduction in institutional support prices should result in a higher return for dairy farmers this year. In the meantime I will continue to exert every possible pressure on the EU Commission to ensure that in its management of the EU dairy regime we achieve a satisfactory outcome for the Irish dairy industry in terms of enhanced industry competitiveness and stable farm incomes into the future.</P>

        <Quest>the prospects for forestry plantings in 2006.</Quest>
        <QRef>[38296/05]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The forest service of my Department <Col N="213"/>has issued approvals for some 40,000 hectares of new forestry over the last two years. The vast majority of these approvals have issued to farmers and, to date, many have chosen not to act upon them. At this point in time, therefore, I have no firm information on which to base a projection of planting levels for next year but it would be reasonable to assume that the level would be at least that of recent years, that is, 10,000 to 11,000 hectares. Clearly, given the number of approvals which my Department has processed, it could be higher and I hope it will be.</P>
        <P>The year 2006 is the last year of the current rural development programme, which provides the most attractive financial package ever for new forestry, including 100% grant aid for planting and substantial annual tax-free premiums, which runs for 20 years in the case of farmers. I would also remind farmers that under the single payment scheme up to 50% of land can be planted, and forestry premium payments can be made, without affecting the single payment entitlement. This makes forestry a real proposition for farmers who have not already planted. I would also point out that those who plant in 2006, under the very attractive terms of the current scheme, will continue to benefit from those terms even after the new EU rural development regulation comes into force in 2007. In the circumstance, there is a compelling case for farmers, in particular, to plant now.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the EU sugar regime, each member state has a quota for manufactured sugar. There is no quota for sugar beet. The EU regulations stipulate that the quota must be made available to the sugar manufacturing enterprises in the member state. Accordingly, in Ireland the entire sugar quota is processed by Irish Sugar Ltd., which is the only sugar manufacturer in this country. Irish Sugar Ltd. places annual contracts with farmers to grow sugar beet sufficient to manufacture the sugar quota.</P>
        <P>Ownership of the sugar quota had never been an issue in the past because the relevant EU regulations do not provide for the buying and selling of quota. Speculations about quota ownership only arose when the Commission, in July 2004, raised the possibility of cross-border quota mobility in the context of its initial thinking on reform of the EU sugar regime. Several member states, including Ireland, voiced strong opposition to the idea of cross-border mobility and it did not form part of the Commission&rsquo;s legislative reform proposals. In any event, the EU Commission has confirmed that the quota is not an asset owned <Col N="214"/>by the member state or any other party but is simply a mechanism for regulating the market.</P>

	<P>I am very satisfied with the outcome of the discussions with the European Commission.

The success of the discussions will deliver a significant benefit to farmers, particularly those in the west of Ireland.</P>

        <Quest>her views on the incidence of brucellosis in cattle herds to date in 2005 compared to 2003 and 2004.</Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The incidence of brucellosis has been falling progressively since 1998. For example, the number of laboratory positives has fallen from 6,417 in 1998 to 664 in 2004. The total number of animals slaughtered under the eradication programme fell from 29,778 to 6,195 during the same period.</P>
        <P>There has been a further improvement in the situation in 2005 compared with 2003 and 2004. In the period to the end of October, the number of blood positives in 2005 was 215 compared with 616 in 2004 and 821 in 2003. The number of animals slaughtered fell from 12,413 and 6,095 respectively during the same period in 2003 and 2004 to 1,750 in 2005.</P>
        <P>The substantial improvement in the disease situation is due to a number of factors, including continued co-operation from all parties with the eradication regime, the tightening up of illegal cattle movements through the cattle movement monitoring system, the regulation of dealers, prosecutions for breaches and the imposition of penalties for failures to comply with animal disease and identification regulations.</P>
        <P>I am confident that this progress can be maintained into the future with the continued operation of the existing measures and the ongoing co-operation of farmers and all involved in the livestock industry. It is vital, however, that we <Col N="215"/>continue to recognise that brucellosis is a highly contagious disease and that we do not relax or relent in our efforts to eradicate it from our national herd. In view of this, we need to continue in the medium term with the existing comprehensive control and eradication measures, which have brought about positive results in recent years in terms of reduced incidence of the disease.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 94 together.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for energy policy, including the promotion of the biofuels sector, rests primarily with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
        <P>It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Ltd. to make decisions about sugar beet growing in Ireland in light of the reformed sugar regime, on which political agreement was reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers&rsquo; meeting on 24 November 2005. The reform agreement will come into effect from 1 July 2006 and provides a range of options.</P>
        <P>The production of ethanol from sugar beet is a possible alternative outlet for farmers but, as matters stand, Irish Sugar Ltd. has arrangements in place to process the full Irish sugar quota at its Mallow plant, which has been upgraded for that purpose. The question of establishing a bioethanol plant based on sugar beet would be a matter for commercial decision.</P>
        <P>In future, under the decoupled system of support payments, farmers will only grow crops which provide an economic return. The announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s budget of the excise duty relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, some 163 million litres of biofuels per year should stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This is a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>To encourage the growing of sugar beet as an energy crop, the EU Commission intends, during 2006, to amend the relevant regulations to allow sugar beet to qualify for set-aside payments, when cultivated as a non-food crop, and also to be made eligible for the energy crop aid of &euro;45 per <Col N="216"/>hectare. The sugar reform agreement also permits the partial dismantlement of a sugar factory and the continued use of the production site for the production of non-food products such as bioethanol. In these circumstances, the final agreement provided that 75% of the restructuring aid be payable. This represented an increase on what the Commission originally proposed.</P>
        <P>I am anxious to encourage further research to assist the development of the biofuels industry. Teagasc has already done some valuable work in this area and I also arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department&rsquo;s research stimulus programme. Details of the successful projects will be announced shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 73 together.</P>
        <P>The regulation of food safety will be simplified under the new food hygiene legislation which comes into effect from 1 January 2006. This legislation consolidates and updates 17 EU regulations and directives which will be repealed next January.</P>
        <P>Food safety is non-negotiable and our experience is that consumer confidence is essential for the development of the food industry. It requires in the first place best practice from all in the food chain and appropriate responsibility being accepted by producers and processors themselves. In addition, there must be objective, independent, and transparent systems for ensuring maintenance of high standards and prompt and pro-active measures taken where risks emerge.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of legislation within the food sector is centralised in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. These controls are carried out by way of service contract with a number of Departments and agencies as provided for under section 48 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998. These include my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the 33 local authorities and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>My Department is responsible for certain food products and is committed to giving a quality service that is efficient, effective, courteous and user-friendly to all its customers and clients. There is an action plan which establishes standards and guidelines for the delivery of services, dealings with its customers and clients, including service delivery targets from the entire range of Department activities. The plan also invites feedback, from individual customers and staff alike, on our services so as to ensure that they meet the changing needs of our customers.</P>
        <P>In this regard my Department endeavours to ensure that any regulatory requirements are implemented in a fair and even manner, while also bearing in mind the need for appropriate <Col N="218"/>controls in certain circumstances. My Department would be happy to examine any suggestions to eliminate unnecessary red tape if instances are brought to my attention.</P>

	<P>Food has been identified by the Government as one of the most promising in regard to developing co-operation with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. The market potential there is huge and it has to be said that we are at the very early stages of establishing a foothold in that country. I participated in a major trade delegation to China, which was led by an Taoiseach in January of this year, in which food promotion featured strongly.</P>
        <P>The People&rsquo;s Republic of China features prominently in Bord Bia&rsquo;s programme of activities and several promotional visits have been undertaken there this year, including hosting two major food conferences during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit, in both Shanghai and Beijing.</P>
        <P>Irish food exports to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China have grown from &euro;7 million in 2000 to an estimated &euro;20 million in 2004. Of the &euro;20 million, almost &euro;10 million is accounted for by dairy products, up from nearly &euro;8 million in 2003. A major Irish food operator announced in January of this year details of a &euro;20 million investment programme in that country to meet the growing requirements for food ingredients and flavours for its booming economy and fast growing dynamic consumer market requirements.</P>
        <P>I signed the pork protocol in Beijing in January this year. This established the basic framework for exporting Irish pork to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and was evidence that the authorities there are happy with our veterinary standards and food safety control systems. Since then, there have been exchanges of correspondence with the authorities in Beijing which resulted in agreement on the text of the veterinary certificate that will accompany consignments.</P>
        <P>Detailed questionnaires required by the veterinary authorities in Beijing have been completed by prospective exporters and these were forwarded in August. The response of the authorities is awaited but they have indicated that it will be some time before they have completed their full examination of the documentation. I understand that other countries are also experiencing delays of this nature. My Department will continue to press for progress to enable the direct trade in pork to the People&rsquo;s Republic of China to commence as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I have recently received the report and recommendations from the interdepartmental working group established to draw up recommendations on national strategies and best practice for the coexistence of GM crops alongside non-GM crops. This report is now being placed on my Department&rsquo;s website and I am inviting observations on the recommendations in the report from all interested parties. These observations will be taken into account before I proceed with the introduction of coexistence measures which I am obliged to do under EU law. The report outlines the evolution of GM technology over the last decade or so and addresses the main issues surrounding the cultivation of GM crops. These issues include the principles laid down in the Commission guidelines on GM co-existence; Government policy on GMOs; scientific factors; new developments in GM technology; the Irish crop production system, farm infrastructure liability where adventitious mixing of GM and non-GM crops might occur. I believe the report will serve as a comprehensive and valuable source of information on GM crop production and it should assist farmers and their advisers and consultants to make informed decisions on GM crop cultivation.</P>

	<P>The position is that, over the past year, meetings of the single payment advisory committee, comprising representatives of my Department, the farming organisations and Teagasc, were held on a number of occasions to discuss the rules governing the allocation of entitlements from the national reserve. At more recent meetings, the committee assessed progress on processing the national reserve applications and discussed, in particular, what should constitute the &ldquo;regional average value of entitlements&rdquo;. Under the regulations governing the national reserve, allocations to farmers who are successful under certain categories must not have the effect <Col N="220"/>of increasing their entitlements above the regional average value of entitlements. My officials subsequently sought clarification on certain issues from the European Commission and I will shortly be taking final decisions on the matter. The intention is that allocations will be made to successful applicants early in the new year.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 52, 54, 81, 83, 102 and 106 together.</P>
        <P>The recent political agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in relation to reform of the EU sugar regime was the culmination of a protracted and difficult negotiating process. The outcome, in my view, represents the best possible deal that could have been achieved for Irish <Col N="221"/>stakeholders in the circumstances and is a considerable improvement on the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposals of last June. The main features of the agreement are: a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed &mdash; 36% instead of 39%; a phasing-in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed; an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years; a once-off payment worth almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland; and an aid package of up to &euro;145 million for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. The entire compensation package for Ireland has an estimated value in excess of &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime. In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once-off payment of almost &euro;44 million would be available for growers. Also the restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</P>
        <P>The formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. Pending the adoption of the relevant regulations it is not possible to give further definitive information but, as with the earlier phases of CAP reform, my Department will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course. The new regime will come into effect for the 2006-07 marketing year, beginning on 1 July 2006.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 50, 56, 67, 68, 76 and 96 together.</P><Col N="223"/>
        <P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme was formally submitted to the European Commission in July and regulations giving legal effect to it are being finalised following a consultation process.</P>
        <P>Ireland is also proceeding with the case for a derogation designed to allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kgs of organic nitrogen per hectare per annum. The derogation proposes to cater for grassland farms. Discussions with the Commission on the derogation are already under way.</P>
        <P>While the implementation of the action programme will certainly have implications for farmers, I have taken important measures to alleviate the impact on the sector. I have announced proposals for a revised farm waste management scheme for which EU approval is now being sought. The improved scheme will increase the grant rate for both animal housing and slurry storage from the current rate of 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in some counties.</P>
        <P>Other elements of the scheme will include significantly higher investment ceilings, the extension of the scheme to sectors such as pigs and poultry and the removal of any minimum income requirement from farming from the scheme. I hope early approval of the scheme will be forthcoming from the European Commission so that it can be introduced quickly. I also intend to introduce a scheme to support the demonstration of new technologies to help the agriculture sector meet the requirements of the nitrates directive.</P>
        <P>Some concerns have been expressed about the impact of the nitrates directive on the pig and poultry sectors, where many of the larger producers do not have enough land of their own to use the manure that they produce. I am acutely conscious of the need for pig farmers to continue to have adequate spreadlands for pig slurry. I have therefore asked Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser, and I will be urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I will also be seeking to ensure that the necessary record-keeping and inspection regimes are kept to what is strictly necessary.</P>

	<P>My Department has introduced a series of measures aimed at preventing the introduc<Col N="224"/>tion of avian influenza to Ireland and, along with our colleagues in the European Union, are implementing safeguard measures in respect of those countries where the presence of the H5N1 virus has been confirmed. Specifically, a ban has been placed on the importation of all captive birds from outside the European Union and a ban on poultry and most poultry products has also been imposed on those countries in which the virus has been confirmed.</P>
        <P>Because of the role played by migratory wild birds in introducing the disease, there are obvious limitations on the measures which can be taken to ensure that Ireland is not affected by avian &rsquo;flu. Therefore, my Department has focused much of its efforts in ensuring that any introduction of the disease is identified quickly and eradicated without delay and, in this regard, has an &ldquo;early warning system&rdquo; in place and is currently undertaking the annual EU avian influenza survey, which is an essential part of our defence mechanism.</P>
        <P>My Department has also ensured that all EU Commission decisions aimed at preventing the introduction and spread of the disease are fully applied in Irish law through a series of statutory instruments. These include a ban on the gathering of poultry for shows, markets, exhibitions and cultural events. My Department has also made it a legal requirement for all owners of poultry and other birds to register their details with my Department. The register of premises will play a vital role in identifying the location of poultry flocks in the event of a suspected or confirmed outbreak and is another vital component of the Department&rsquo;s approach to ensuring the speedy eradication of the virus.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fully satisfied that the measures taken to date are proportionate to the current risk. My Department continues to keep the situation under constant review and we will not  hesitate to implement such additional measures as are considered appropriate to any increased risk.</P>

This envelope represented the average value of livestock and arable aid premia paid in the member state during the three-year reference period 2000-2002 calculated at 2002 rates of payment together with the 2005 decoupled dairy premium. The outcome, which will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future in making it more relevant to modern society, was a balanced one, which addressed Ireland&rsquo;s principal objectives. <Col N="225"/>Among these objectives was the preservation of the financial benefits achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and the establishment of a policy framework that will allow farmers and the agri-sector the flexibility to adapt to evolving consumer and market demands and international circumstances.</P>
        <P>Index linking of the single payment scheme was not an element of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals. There was, however, a proposal to provide for a reduction of up to 13% in the single payment, known as &ldquo;degression&rdquo;, to meet future financing needs. I believe one of the major achievements in the negotiations was the removal of this proposal, which means a saving of some &euro;420 million for Ireland over the lifetime of the agreement. The compromise agreed was to allow the Council to review the financial situation annually, from 2007 onwards, if budget deficits arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 75 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is already a long history of co-operation between the administrations North and South on animal health issues. The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot and mouth emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.</P>
        <P>The establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy. The main objectives of the council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free move<Col N="226"/>ment of animals and animal products within the island.</P>
        <P>Nine policy working groups have been established at official level under North-South arrangements to take forward various initiatives. The remit of these groups includes TB and brucellosis, TSEs, BSE and scrapie, veterinary medicines, other zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-Border aspects of fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.</P>
        <P>The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the development of similar approaches to combat the introduction of animal diseases, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation on issues such as contingency planning.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to the above, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, avian influenza and cross-Border fraud while the farm animal welfare advisory council includes representation from DARD. On cross-Border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.</P>

	<P>REPS 3 has been a major success and participation has broken previous records. Spending on REPS has increased from &euro;208 million in 2004 to more than &euro;270 million by the end of this year, and provision has been made in the 2006 Estimates for a further increase to &euro;323 million next year. The increased allocation for 2006 reflects the fact that I expect that there will be further significant growth in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that the food industry must be developed at all levels in the new more market <Col N="227"/>oriented CAP framework. In this context, a new initiative involving the holding of regional food fora to promote local and regional food economies was launched recently. The first regional food forum organised by my Department and Bord Bia with all other State agencies responsible for food industry development was held in Donegal recently.</P>
        <P>The north west forum, Market Focus for Small Food Enterprises, focused on some of the issues confronting small food producers and key speakers shared experiences on regional food marketing and development with food enterprises from counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
        <P>State agencies and service providers were in attendance to offer advice and assistance to producers or enterprises interested in building small food businesses and a variety of food products from the north west was showcased, emphasising the importance of the food industry to the region&rsquo;s economy. I also launched the North West Food and Drink Trade Directory, a comprehensive guide to small food business in the north west, as well as agencies at national and regional level. Access to timely and up-to-date industry information is important for small businesses and the guide is a valuable reference source for the food industry in the region.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This initiative aims to stimulate and expand interest in regional and local food production and to encourage the formation and growth of more small rural-based food enterprises on a regional basis. The speciality and artisan food sectors have developed a new momentum and research indicates that further opportunities exist for the right products. There is considerable scope to develop new opportunities in Ireland and the United Kingdom, where the market is forecast to reach &euro;7.5 billion over the next three years.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to use this forum model in other areas of the country to ensure a continued focus on the potential for local food production. I believe that by working closely with farmers, small food producers and local agencies we can successfully promote food enterprise and innovation to develop unique products reflecting the strengths of each region.</P>

	<P>My Department directs a substantial amount of funding into the organic sector in pro<Col N="228"/>portion to its size. Organic farmers, while entitled to the investments and supports available to conventional farmers, can also avail of additional supports under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector.</P>
        <P>Organic farmers in REPS can draw down a substantial extra payment. In 2004, my Department paid almost &euro;4 million directly to organic farmers and that has risen to &euro;5.3 million this year to date. The total paid to organic farmers since REPS began amounts to over &euro;31 million. I provided &euro;1.2 million this year for the scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector, to support investment both on-farm and off-farm, and I intend to ensure that grant aid will continue to be available to support modernisation and innovation in this important sector.</P>

	<P>The Food Agency Co-operation Council has met on 20 occasions since its inception in 2000. During 2004 a number of factors contributed to difficulties in scheduling meetings and priority was given instead in 2004 and 2005 to meetings of the food development agencies directly concerned with the food programme components of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Two such meetings took place in 2004 and one in 2005 to assess progress on the plan in preparation for meetings of the NDP monitoring committees.</P>
        <P>My Department is examining the role and format of the food agency co-operation council, and the manner in which the various food agencies can most effectively co-operate to develop the agri-food industry, in the light of the more market orientated CAP framework, the 2015 Agri-Vision report and the enterprise strategy report. A number of initiatives are planned at regional level, which will see the various agencies engage and co-operate with my Department to develop the food industry. The first of these initiatives, the north west food forum &mdash; Market Focus for Small Food Enterprises &mdash; took place in Killybegs on 4 November. At the forum, significant time was allocated for the agencies to network with the industry&rsquo;s stakeholders and to showcase the services available to assist food company development in the region. Similar events focused in other regions as well as other initiatives involving inter-agency co-operation to promote the <Col N="229"/>development of the food industry at all levels will be rolled out during 2006.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Primary responsibility for the welfare of animals rests with the owner or keeper of the animals. The owners-keepers are obliged to take all reasonable steps to ensure the welfare of animals under their care and to ensure that such animals are not caused any unnecessary pain, suffering or injury. To the extent that it can my Department seeks to ensure that optimum animal welfare standards apply on farms.</P>
        <P>The welfare of animals kept for farming purposes in general is covered by the European Communities (Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes) Regulations 2000 and the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act 1984. In addition, the welfare of calves and pigs is subject to the European Communities (Welfare of Calves and Pigs) Regulations 2003, SI 48 of 2003, which set out minimum requirements for accommodation in relation to space, lighting, ventilation, veterinary treatment etc. and to allow animals to express natural behaviour. Laying hens are subject to the provisions of the European Communities (Welfare of Laying Hens) Regulations 2002, SI 98 of 2002, which specify the accommodation and other welfare requirements for keeping and rearing laying hens. Earlier this year the EU Commission made proposals for a council directive to further protect the welfare of broilers. That draft directive is at present under discussion at EU level and my Department is participating in those discussions.</P>
        <P>Current legislation also provides for the protection of the welfare of animals being transported. Inspections on the welfare of animals being transported are undertaken by officials from my Department on a national spot-check basis at meat factories, marts and ports and any follow-up action necessary is undertaken. The outcome of these inspections is reported to the European Commission. Complaints received by my Department about on-farm welfare of animals are investigated thoroughly under the above-mentioned regulations and appropriate action is taken.</P>
        <P>The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, FAWAC, which was established in 2002, has brought together for the first time in Ireland representatives of the principal stakeholders, welfare organisations, farming bodies, Departments North and South, and veterinary representative bodies in an advisory body. FAWAC has already <Col N="230"/>published animal welfare guidelines for beef, dairy and sheep farmers and for owners-keepers of horses, ponies and donkeys. Guidelines on the welfare of broiler chickens are currently being drafted.</P>
        <P>One of the initiatives which has recently been taken under the umbrella of FAWAC is an early warning-intervention system for animal welfare cases which involves my Department, the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals. The objective of this system is to provide a framework at local level within which problems can be identified and addressed before they become critical or overwhelming.</P>
        <P>I believe that the current body of legislation in this area provides the necessary powers to ensure a high level of animal welfare and to prevent ill treatment of animals. I will continue to keep this area under review.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I have outlined in detail to the House on a number of occasions the circumstances surrounding this unusual case. I wish to restate the key aspects. First, the actions by my Department at the time were designed to protect public health by ensuring that animals treated with a prohibited substance did not enter the food chain. Second, my Department obviously wanted to see the animals disposed of in a humane manner and offered to permit the animals to be brought to a slaughter plant. However, the person in charge of the animals chose the manner by which the animals were to be slaughtered and my Department endeavoured to ensure that he did this in a way that the welfare of the animals was not compromised. In view of the fact that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>, I do not propose to comment any further on the case at this stage.</P>

	<P>Live exports continue to be an important outlet for our cattle providing an essential element of competition with the beef trade. Live exports to date in 2005 stand at approximately 170,000 per head against 114,000 for the same period last year. This represents an increase of almost 50%. Live exports in 2004 were, however, sluggish and our exports this year are more in line with our traditional export levels of 2003. Of the exports to date in 2005, 94% went to EU destinations.</P>

	<P>The need for a focus on innovation and specifically on research and development as key drivers of creativity and growth within an economy is recognised at both EU and national level. At the Lisbon Summit in March 2000, EU leaders agreed that the European Union should aim to become the world&rsquo;s most competitive economy by 2010 and to raise spending on research and development to 3% of GDP by 2010.</P>
        <P>The current level of research and development spend in Ireland is 1.13% of GDP and the Government is committed to increasing that in line with the Lisbon target. Within the National Development Plan 2000-2006, over &euro;106 million of the &euro;358 million envelope for the food sector is earmarked for research, technology and innovation. This is made up of &euro;70 million for food research, with a &ldquo;public good&rdquo; element under FIRM, the food institutional research measure operated by my Department, as well as &euro;30 million in research and development assistance by Enterprise Ireland working with Irish food companies and research institutes to exploit the benefits of technology innovation and to support companies undertaking research and development. The development of the functional foods industry in Ireland has been identified as a national priority. The sector is specifically mentioned in the strategy recommendations by the Agri 2010 and Agri-Vision 2015 committees and in the recently published report by the enterprise <Col N="233"/>strategy group. Innovation in functional foods and nutritional research have been among the themes in calls for proposals issued under my Department&rsquo;s FIRM programme. The relay dissemination project, which is funded by FIRM, ensures that research approved and research outputs are made available to industry though a dedicated website, workshops, seminars and papers.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is committed to the successful development and growth of the functional foods sector and, in the light of the significant challenge and opportunities, which it presents, has established a national functional foods forum. The forum consists of members from industry, the research and academic community, State bodies and some industry representatives as well as my own Department, which will help formulate and drive the strategy for the sector. Functional foods are based on bioactive cultures, or probiotics, and physiologically active ingredients, or nutraceuticals. Probiotics currently dominate research in this area in Ireland and there is little existing activity in the development of nutraceuticals. Teagasc, which partnered UCC in establishing the successful alimentary probiotic centre, has made a proposal for the establishment of a new department for nutraceutical research to fill a gap in public research and to create opportunities for innovative product development in industry that otherwise would not exist. The proposal is being considered by my Department.</P>
        <P>I am committed to continuing support for research in the food sector and to the building of strong partnerships between industry, academia and Government with a deep understanding of consumer trends and demands here and abroad.</P>

	<P>I am aware that genetically modified cotton is grown extensively in many countries, particularly in the US, India and China, and is widely used in the clothing industry. I am also aware that the enzyme chymosin, extracted from a GM organism, has for many years been used in the manufacture of cheese and that many GM micro nutrients, such as riboflavin, are used in food and feed. Trade in all of these products on a worldwide basis has become commonplace. The rules governing the production and use of GMOs within the EU are set down in legislation that has been jointly adopted by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and is binding on all member states.</P><Col N="234"/>
        <P Just="Left">Legislation governing the control of GMOs in Ireland comes under three Departments and agencies under the aegis of some of those Departments.

        <P>The implementation of the nitrates directive is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Ireland&rsquo;s national action programme was formally submitted to the European Commission in July, and regulations giving legal effect to the programme are being finalised following a consultation process.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The main reason Ireland&rsquo;s milk yield and composition varies from that of other EU countries is due to the different dairy production systems in operation. In Ireland, the majority of cow herds are spring calving and cows are fed on a grass based diet, which has proven to be the most cost efficient and profitable system under Irish conditions. In most other European countries, the majority of cows calve in the autumn and are fed a concentrate-based diet, resulting in a different composition and milk yield. Milk recording of cows has been identified as a crucial factor in helping farmers improve milk yields by making them aware of production abilities of individual breeds. I have made available the sum of &euro;1 million to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation to support electronic milk recording.</P>

	<P Just="Left">An Bord Bia is statutorily obliged under the Bord Bia Acts to charge a levy on cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter and at export. The proceeds of the levies are used by An Bord Bia to fund promotional activities for the sector concerned. The rates of the statutory levies are &euro;1.90, &euro;0.25 and &euro;0.25 on bovines, sheep and pigs respectively. These rates have not been increased since they were first introduced in the late 1970&rsquo;s. The state aid rules governing advertising require the sector benefiting from the activity to contribute at least 50% of the cost as the State may not fund such activities at a level above 50%. The rules also require that the levies on livestock at export and at slaughter, be applied systematically and in accordance with the same criteria. A reduction in the levy proceeds would require a <Col N="236"/>proportionate reduction in Exchequer funding to comply with the 50% rule on State funding.</P>
        <P>EU legislation provides for the recovery of the cost of providing the meat hygiene inspection service at export approved meat plants. My Department applies fees in this regard to all animals slaughtered, which represent only part of the cost of providing the inspection service. A standard fee per species is charged across all meat plants and the rates are fixed under Statutory Instrument 74 of 2004. The bovine levies, which are collected under the Bovine Disease (Levies) Act 1979, are intended to ensure that farmers share the cost of compensation paid under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. The Government reduced the levies by a third with effect from 1 January 2005. This decision, which followed a 25% reduction in 2004, reduced the levies to their pre-2003 levels. The levies now cover approximately 50% of the cost of compensation under the eradication schemes.</P>

	<P>Under the rules governing the Single Market, it is not possible to restrict imports on grounds other than health and safety or to require retailers to source products from production within a certain radius. These rules apply equally in all member states and have worked to our advantage in that our food and drink exports account for &euro;7 billion in exports, far outweighing product sourced elsewhere. Ireland exports as much as 90% of production for some sectors.</P>
        <P>My priority as Minister for Agriculture and Food is to lead the sustainable development of a competitive consumer-focused agri-food sector and to contribute to a vibrant rural economy and society. The key to sustainable development of a competitive food sector, capable of providing nutritious good quality safe food on home and export markets, is traceability through the food chain back to point of production. All the control systems in place within my Department acting in co-operation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland are designed to guarantee such traceability. There is renewed interest in local foodstuffs on the home market as evidenced by the growth in local markets and farmers markets around the country. An Bord Bia, as part of its statutory role in promoting the development of <Col N="237"/>Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry is working with other State and local agencies to develop the farmers market as an alternative route to market. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, they have published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of these markets. They also provide a range of support services for farmers markets including advice and mentoring assistance and have a dedicated person in the small business department to assist both producers and individuals. Bord Bia also offers marketing supports and indeed its financial supports are geared to smaller companies.</P>
        <P>In the local context, I have made a point of encouraging interest in the organic sector and facilitating the organic sector in REPS together with encouraging investment in the horticulture sector. I launched the North West Food Forum, the first of a series of regional food forums to promote cohesion between the food industry, food producers and development agencies and to develop regional strengths in the food sector, which has a perhaps unique spatial presence country-wide. The theme for the first forum was a focus on the marketplace as awareness and a deep understanding of the consumer is essential to building close connections between the primary producer and the consumer.</P>

	<P>Veterinary practices are primarily commercial entities and their locations are driven by commercial realities. However, insofar as State involvement is concerned, a number of recent measures will alleviate difficulties which may arise in certain parts of the country. Under the new Veterinary Practice Act, which will come into effect on 1 January 2006, provision is made to enable the Veterinary Council for the first time to recognize qualifications from applicants in third countries generally. Taken with the recent enlargement of the EU, this will make for improved availability of practitioners to meet shortfalls that may arise on the supply side. The Animal Remedies Regulations 2005, which I signed into law on the 17 November 2005, contain a number of measures which will enable veterinary practitioners and their farmer clients to avoid difficulties in this area. These include changes to <Col N="239"/>the prescribing rules in terms of the need to clinically examine an animal and extended validity of prescriptions, the details of which I have already outlined in the House. The regulations also include a provision which, in a genuine emergency situation and subject to appropriate safeguards, will enable a pharmacist to supply a prescription medicine in advance of receiving a written prescription. I understand that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta provides funding to subsidise veterinary practices in some remote areas in consultation with the local farming community.</P>

	<P>The development of new markets for Irish food produce is primarily the responsibility of the food industry. However, my Department, in co-operation with the statutory food promotion agency Bord Bia, will continue to assist the industry to identify markets for Irish agricultural and food produce in the EU and internationally, to build on existing markets by extending the value-added component, to identifying market segments with growth potential and to innovate to retain consumer and buyer interest.</P>
        <P>As provided for in the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the main objectives of the food institutional research measure, or FIRM, are to provide a base of information and expertise in generic technologies that supports innovation and product development in the food industry, and to assist consumer protection by ensuring that product development is underpinned by attention to food safety and quality. General calls in 2000 and 2004 and a targeted call in 2001 covered the development of technologies to build a more competitive, innovative, consumer-focused and sustainable food production and marketing sector; development of the scientific knowledge to underpin effective food safety practices at all stages in the food chain; consumer foods technology; innovation in functional foods; cheese diversification; production of new food ingredients; new technologies for added-value meat products.</P>
        <P>Non-food uses for agriculture and forestry products is an area my Department is giving particular attention to in light of the reformed CAP. Under the reformed CAP, an aid top-up of &euro;45 per hectare was introduced for production of energy crops. It is subject to a maximum guaranteed area of 1.5 million hectares for the EU as a whole. Any agricultural raw material, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown on the areas covered by the aid, provided they are intended primarily for use in the production of either biofuel or electric and thermal energy from biomass. To avail of this aid, crops must be grown on eligible land, not on set-aside, and the aid will be paid only where there is a contract between the farmer and the processing industry, or where the processing is undertaken by the farmer on the holding. This is a coupled aid, so the farmer must grow the crop in order to be eligible for the top-up.</P>
        <P>Energy crops such as oilseed rape, wheat and sugar beet can be used for the manufacture of liquid transport biofuels. Forestry by-products <Col N="241"/>are a rich source of wood biomass for heat or energy generation while various farming by-products such as meat and bone meal and tallow can be used for energy or heat generation and biodiesel manufacture respectively. For the purposes of contributing to the development of policy on biofuels, my Department in conjunction with COFORD and Teagasc has examined the potential of energy crops, wood biomass and farming and food by-products. In general, the production of energy crops for biofuels will have to be demand led and production by farmers will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by traditional crop enterprises. The scheme announced earlier this year by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who has overall responsibility for energy policy including the promotion and development of biofuels, for mineral oil tax relief on pilot biofuel projects has stimulated the production of oilseed rape for biofuel. The announcement in yesterday&rsquo;s budget of the excise duty relief scheme to cover, when the relief is fully operational, around 163 million litres of biofuels per year should further stimulate the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels. This is a very welcome development.</P>
        <P>The exploitation of wood resources for energy purposes, mainly for heat or electricity generation, offers significant potential. There are also significant opportunities for using by-products of farming and food processing for bioenergy purposes. Approximately 140,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal is produced annually and its use in place of fossil fuels could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 19%. I wish to encourage further research to assist the development of biofuels and have arranged for research projects on biofuels and other non-food uses of crops to be included in the latest call under my Department&rsquo;s research stimulus programme. Details of the successful projects will be announced shortly. To encourage the growing of sugar beet as an energy crop, the EU Commission intends to amend the relevant regulations in 2006 to allow sugar beet to qualify for set-aside payments when cultivated as a non-food crop, and to be made eligible for the energy crop aid of &euro;45 per hectare.</P>
        <P>In addition to the traditional market for timber, Ireland&rsquo;s forests also provide a number of other non-timber benefits including carbon sequestration, wood energy, biodiversity conservation, recreation and tourism. A recent publication by COFORD, &ldquo;Markets for non-wood Forest Products&rdquo;, states that markets do exist for a variety of other non-wood forest products such as game, fruit, fungi and foliage and that these are at a very early stage of development in Ireland. The forest service of my Department is active on a number of fronts to develop forestry to its full potential, including this area of non-timber benefits and products. The forest service is funding a number of pilot projects in the area <Col N="242"/>of wood energy, including an integrated forest-to-energy project in County Clare. Other initiatives are also being planned. COFORD, the forest research and development agency under my Department, is also to the forefront of promoting wood energy. The forest service also funds the neighbour-wood scheme which offers considerable support to groups, including local authorities, to work in partnership in developing appropriate woodland amenities in and around villages, towns and cities. Such amenities, designed and equipped for public access, recreation and enjoyment, impart a wide range of benefits to the surrounding communities.</P>

	<P>My Department examines and assesses the impact of all policy proposals emerging at EU level and the wider international context for their impact on agriculture and the rural economy. The agri-vision 2015 report also identified the rapidly changing nature of Irish agriculture and the issues facing the agriculture and food industries in the future including the need for market driven production and greater levels of productivity. The report sets out a framework for the future for Irish agriculture and details what actions and changes are required in order to achieve desired targets. The report placed great emphasis on meeting consumer requirements and the role of competitiveness in the production process in the context of an increasingly global market.</P>
        <P>I intend to produce and launch a plan of action in the new year that will set out a clear programme of work for my own Department, and for the other players in the sector, which will seek to enhance the competitiveness of the agriculture and food industries to fulfil their productive potential and position them to meet the challenges ahead.</P>

	<P>All live commercial animals imported into Ireland from either an EU member state or a third country must be accompanied by an official health certificate from the competent authority of the exporting country confirming that the animals have undergone all appropriate tests and have not come from an area affected by any animal disease. Veterinary inspection checks operate at all of Ireland&rsquo;s official border inspection posts to ensure imports meet physical, documentary and identity requirements.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the protection measures in place are robust and comprehensive and minimise any possibility of any animal disease being introduced into Ireland. Such measures are kept under constant review and my Department will not hesitate to introduce any such additional measures as may be considered appropriate to an increased threat of animal disease being introduced to the country.</P>
        <P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries. Under harmonised legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>With regard to preventing the importation of plant diseases, all plant importers, in accordance with EU and national legislation, must be registered and pre-notify my Department of consignments landed in the country and the relevant material is meticulously inspected for quarantine diseases, and if required, laboratory testing. Only after this process are they then cleared into general circulation. Surveys and inspections are conducted throughout the country for quarantine pests and diseases, in particular for those which Ireland has protected zone status. My Depart<Col N="244"/>ment actively participates in the work of the EU Standing Committee on Plant Health and other international plant health fora for the co-ordination of legislation and actions to prevent and-or limit the spread of plant diseases.</P>

	<P>With annual farm-gate production valued currently at &euro;270 million and retail sales in the order of &euro;650 million, the sector employs some 10,000 people across the production and distribution chain. The key issue that has impacted on the development of the horticulture industry as a whole in recent years is the increased concentration at retail level with the consequent significant change in the supply chain. My Department, recognising the marketing advantages and challenges of consolidation and scale, has contributed to the development of the industry, particularly through its grant aid schemes under the national development plan. These schemes have been a catalyst for investment and growth and have assisted producers to upgrade or develop new production facilities and have also enabled commercial enterprises to improve marketing and processing facilities.</P>
        <P>The scheme to assist capital investment on farms under the national development plan aims to promote the specialisation and diversification of on-farm activities, improvement in the quality of products and to facilitate environmentally friendly practices and improved working conditions on farms. Since 2001 over &euro;8 million has been paid to 400 horticultural producers throughout the country to upgrade or develop new facilities. This year a &euro;6 million grant package will fund projects to the value of over &euro;17 million. All areas of horticulture are eligible for the scheme.</P>
        <P>Demand in the consumer and foodservice sectors is buoyant, both for fresh and prepared chilled produce and convenient value-added products. The retail value of prepared horticultural produce was estimated to be &euro;59.8 million in 2004, representing a two-fold increase on 2001 and there are real investment opportunities and challenges for development of this sector. For the first time this year, projects in the fruit and vegetable sector have been prioritised in the scheme of aid for the marketing and processing of agricultural products, which supports capital investment to enhance competitiveness and added value. Some 23 applications were submitted representing total investments of &euro;25 million and <Col N="245"/>these are currently in the final stages of evaluation.</P>
        <P>In addition, horticulture producers benefit from EU aid under the producer organisation scheme. Some &euro;5.6 million was paid to ten recognised producer organisations this year. The development of producer organisations under EU regulations has made a very important contribution to the development of the sector as it enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in the production and marketing of their product.</P>

	<P>The main concern of my Department in relation to so called bed and breakfast facilities relates to the potentially significant disease risks, particularly TB and brucellosis, associated with the mixing of cattle from different sources in housing sheds. In view of this concern, my Department has set down minimum requirements governing the movement of cattle into such sheds and it also issues reminders of these requirements to farmers at this time of year when cattle are being moved into these types of facilities. In <Col N="246"/>addition, my Department provides bio-security advice to operators of these facilities with a view to minimising disease risks.</P>
        <P>With regard to the minimum requirements, the position is that movements to and from a B&amp;B must conform to the same test requirements as sale-mart movements. Keepers of animals moving animals to or from a B&amp;B must obtain a CMMS compliance certificate prior to movement and all movements must be recorded on the herd registers of the sender and the receiver. For disease tracing purposes and to fulfil EU requirements, any calves born on B and B holdings must be tagged and registered by the keeper of the B&amp;B, using ear tags appropriate to the B&amp;B holding. The notification of movement and proper record keeping are paramount in the event of a disease outbreak where prompt tracing of all potentially exposed or infected animals is essential.</P>
        <P>With regard to bio-security advice, my Department has emphasised that, where possible, cattle from one farm of origin should be kept separate from cattle from other farms so as to minimise the risk of disease transmission. In addition, my Department&rsquo;s advice at all times is not to place pregnant female cattle into a B&amp;B situation. Where this is unavoidable, farmers should minimise the risk by seeking out facilities where they will be the sole occupier. Where this is not possible, pregnant animals should be isolated until after they have passed a post-calving blood test for brucellosis. Cleaning and disinfection and general hygiene in the B&amp;B should be of the highest possible standards.</P>
        <P>I believe that if the conditions and bio-security advice are fully complied with, both by farmers availing of B&amp;B facilities and B&amp;B operators, the disease risks to cattle moved into B&amp;B sheds will be minimised.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Beef production is extremely valuable to the Irish economy with a &euro;1.4 billion export value representing almost 25% of total Irish agri-food exports. In 2004 Ireland produced 560,000 tonnes of beef and exported 495,000 tonnes. Almost 90% of these exports went to EU markets. This trend is continuing in 2005 and there is no indication that the beef industry is in <Col N="247"/>decline. The shift to EU markets for the vast bulk of our exports in fact strengthens our position from a strategic point of view.</P>
        <P>The year 2005 has been a relatively good one for cattle producers with strong demand continuing across European markets. Average prices are up 9% on the same period last year and up over 3% on the year as a whole to date. While we did see an unusually steep seasonal decrease in prices this summer, the position has recovered and in recent weeks, improved demand and tighter supply has seen a rise in prices again in Ireland and across the EU. Production for 2005 is expected to be down by 3% on 2004.</P>
        <P>The reverse situation is expected in 2006 where the outlook is that Irish beef production is estimated to increase by 5%, contrasting with a decreasing production trend throughout continental Europe. The EU beef market is again forecast to remain in deficit by approximately 350,000 tonnes. This will create a positive market environment and should maintain good demand for Irish beef in our key markets with good prices being achieved. An increased presence in this sophisticated high value market is seen as the key to the success of the beef industry in the long term.</P>
        <P>The 2003 mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy has allowed Irish beef farmers to farm exclusively for the market as premia have been replaced with a single decoupled payment. Farmers can now specialise in enterprises at which they have a comparative advantage with no limiting forms of production save the supply and demand balance of the marketplace. Our ability to grow grass over a long growing season and our mild climate will ensure that we remain a significant producer of cattle in the future.</P>
        <P>A main factor on the horizon is the WTO and the effect an agreement might have on our beef sector. While we have a number of concerns going into these negotiations, it is my aim to get the best possible outcome for our beef sector in relation to access arrangements to EU markets from non-EU suppliers, including the sensitive products mechanism, phasing and parallelism in relation to export support and the protection of green box decoupled direct payments. I have also made my views on non-trade issues, such as the need for equivalence in standards, well known to the Commission who are negotiating on the part of the EU.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The designation of land under the EU birds and habitats directives is a function of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The question of compensation for farmers in the Shannon callows area is a matter, in the first instance, for that Department and I understand that discussions on the matter with the farming bodies have been going on for some time and are still continuing.</P>
        <P>As far as REPS is concerned, arrangements are already in place designed specifically to address the situation of farmers in the Shannon callows. Farmers in this area who wish to join REPS, but believe that the REPS payments do not fully offset any income loss arising from the restrictions placed on their farming activities because of designation under the birds and habitats directives, may now also apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for additional compensation. Before this arrangement was introduced in September 2004, such farmers had to choose between REPS and the compensation arrangements operated by NPWS but could not benefit from both.</P>
        <P>This concession is additional to the inclusion of a new supplementary measure in REPS when REPS 3 was introduced in June 2004. Designated areas are already eligible for payments, under REPS measure A, of &euro;242 per hectare for the first 40 hectares and lesser amounts for areas over 40 hectares and the new supplementary measure provides for an additional payment of &euro;100 per hectare on particular sites in the callows, which are important corncrake habitats. Those sites are monitored by BirdWatch Ireland, and REPS farmers can qualify for the additional payment by subscribing to BirdWatch Ireland management prescriptions for them.</P>
        <P>REPS is a highly successful agri-environment measure and is acknowledged as such by the European Commission. One of the features of REPS which the Commission has commended is the fact that the whole farm is subjected to the full range of basic undertakings. This model has served Irish farmers well since the introduction of REPS in 1994 and I see no reason to depart from the whole-farm approach to accommodate a situation which I believe has already been addressed adequately. However, I have recently started a consultation process with stakeholders on the next REP scheme, which will run from 2007 and it is open to any party to make suggestions relating to the Shannon callows as part of this process.</P>

        <P>Local authorities have specific powers under the Water Pollution and Waste Management Acts to address water pollution and, in particular, are empowered to prescribe specific measures to stop or prevent water pollution or require farmers to engage in nutrient management planning.

        <P>In order to assist farmers meet the additional requirements of the nitrates action programme, I have announced details of a proposed revised farm waste management scheme for which EU state aid approval has been sought. I am hopeful that early approval of the revised scheme will be forthcoming so that it can be introduced next January.</P>
        <P>Subject to the required EU approval, the revised scheme will introduce a standard grant-rate of 60%, with 70% being available for Zone C counties, in place of the current grant-rate of 40%. It will raise the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000, remove any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers can participate in it and extend the scheme to include horses, deer, goats, pigs and poultry, and mushroom compost. Other proposed changes to the scheme include the introduction of a new 40% grant-rate for specialised on-farm equipment with specific environmental advantages.</P>
        <P>Negotiations are currently taking place with the EU Commission on the clearance of the scheme from the point of view of EU state aid rules and I am confident that approval will be secured at an early date.</P>

	<P>The forestry sector provides a high value input to the national economy, and makes a significant contribution to the economic well being of rural communities.</P>
        <P>The forestry sector contributes &euro;698 million annually to the economy. While it is difficult to provide economic values for the non-timber benefits of Irish forests, the 2004 Bacon review estimated an annual value in the region of &euro;88.4 million for the recreation, carbon-storage and bio-diversity benefits.</P>
        <P>Over 14,000 private plantations have been established, the vast majority of these by farmers. In 2004, a total of &euro;54.1 million in forestry premiums was paid out to forest owners. In addition to forest owners, it is estimated that total employment generated by the sector amounts to just over 16,000.</P>

	<P>In August 2003 an interdepartmental group was established to examine issues relating to the co-existence of GM crops alongside non-GM crops and draw up recommendations for co-existence arrangements in Ireland. Among the issues examined by the group was the economic implications of co-existence.</P>
        <P>I have recently received and examined the group&rsquo;s report and recommendations. The report takes on board the full range of factors surrounding the GM issue, including the principles laid down in the Commission guidelines on GM co-existence, Government policy on GMOs, scientific issues, new developments in GM technology, the Irish crop production system and farm infrastructure and liability issues. In the case of the latter it makes recommendations regarding compensation in cases where a non-GM crop grower incurs a verifiable and quantifiable economic loss as a result of the GM maximum labelling threshold being exceeded and how this compensation should be funded.</P>
        <P>However, I believe that the wider economic issues associated with GM cultivation and the use of GM feed should also be examined to enable the agri-food industry to make informed decisions the use of GMO&rsquo;s. Teagasc was asked to carry out an evaluation of the possible costs and benefits for the agri-food industry from the use of GMOs in crop and livestock production. This evaluation is in the final stages of completion and a report is expected soon.</P>

	<P>With over 100 farmers markets now in existence, I believe there is great potential for future growth in this area. I am aware of the role and increasing importance that farmers markets perform in supplementing farm incomes and providing an alternative route to the market for small food producers. They offer direct access to consumers and assist the development and expansion of local and regional speciality foods. They also improve community spirit, create employment and make local areas more attractive for tourism.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am fully committed to supporting efforts to promote, strengthen and organise the farmers markets system on a sustainable basis. On behalf <Col N="252"/>of the Irish Country Markets Association, I recently launched the &ldquo;origin farmers markets&rdquo; initiative in Manorhamilton, County Leitrim. This is a new cross-Border initiative to encourage and develop more farmers market outlets North and South in five Leader areas in counties Donegal, Tyrone, Sligo, Leitrim, Antrim and Roscommon.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia, as part of its statutory role in promoting the development of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink industry, is working with other State and local agencies to develop this route to the market. In co-operation with Invest Northern Ireland, it has published a comprehensive information guide on the operation of these markets. It also provides a range of support services for farmers markets including advice and mentoring assistance and has a dedicated person in the small business department to assist both producers and individuals.</P>
        <P>Bord Bia continues to work closely with the Office of Public Works on developing the successful &lsquo;food at Farmleigh&rsquo; programme. In 2006, the Farmleigh model is being rolled out to other OPW heritage properties around the country including Donegal, Laois, Wexford and Cork.</P>
        <P>In association with Dublin City Council, Bord Bia is also actively involved in the Smithfield regeneration programme and recently facilitated a meeting with interested parties on the proposed development of the fruit, vegetable and fish markets. Attendees were invited to make submissions on the proposed regeneration to the Dublin city planner and a consultative forum, including Bord Bia was established. This initiative will provide access for small food producers to the lucrative Dublin market.</P>

	<P>Trade in sheep between member states of the European Union is subject to the provisions of Council Directive 91/68/EEC as amended, as regards reinforced controls on the movement of sheep and goats.</P>
        <P>These controls as they currently stand provide as a minimum requirement that breeding and fattening sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding for at least 30 days prior to export and that no sheep or goats had been introduced on to the holding in the 21 days prior to export. Slaughter sheep must also be certified as having been continuously resident on the holding of origin for at least 21 days prior to export and are also subject to a standstill period of 21 days prior to dispatch during which no sheep or goats have been introduced on to the holding of origin.</P>
        <P>These controls were introduced in the aftermath of the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 and came into effect on 1 July 2004. There were certain difficulties with these certification requirements arising from the fact that the information the official veterinarian was being required to certify could only be truly known to the farmer. Accordingly I had my Department raise the matter with the European Commission in an effort to arrive at a certification procedure that best met the concerns of farmers and exporters, while, at the same time, protecting animal health. I am pleased that, in response to our approach, the European Commission submitted proposals to amend these certification requirements to allow the official veterinarian to issue certification based on a written declaration by the farmer or on an examination of the flock register and movement documents. The proposals providing for these new arrangements were agreed to unanimously by the standing committee on the food chain and animal health on 11 November 2005 and will apply from 15 February 2006. I am confident that they will resolve most of the outstanding difficulties with certification of exports of sheep to France and the United Kingdom.</P>
        <P>While I am happy to facilitate live sheep exports in any way I can, I point out that securing outlets and the supply and availability of trans<Col N="254"/>port for the carriage of livestock is of course a commercial matter not within the remit of my Department.</P>

	<P>In August 2003 an interdepartmental group was established to examine issues relating to the co-existence of GM crops alongside non-GM crops and draw up rules for co-existence arrangements in Ireland. Among the areas examined by the group was the issue of compensation for a non-GM farmer in the event of economic loss being suffered as a result of GM admixture. The group comprised of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Teagasc and the EPA.</P>
        <P>I have recently received and examined the group&rsquo;s reports and recommendations. The report, which takes on board the full range of factors surrounding the GM issue, namely the principles laid down in the Commission guidelines on GM co-existence, government policy on GMOs, scientific issues, new developments in GM technology, the Irish crop production system and farm infrastructure, makes clear recommendations on cases where a non-GM farmer incurs a verifiable and quantifiable economic loss as a result of the GM maximum labelling threshold being exceeded.</P>
        <P>While the group engaged extensively with identified stakeholders I have decided, in order to allow all concerned put forward their views on the proposed arrangements for co-existence, to place the report on my Department&rsquo;s website and invite further observations on the recommendations in the report.

        <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the risk of Lyme disease from deer ticks; if arrangements will be made to have notices placed in appropriate settings where the risk from this infection is possible; if a publicity campaign will be initiated to inform the public of the risks; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borelliosis, is an infection caused by a spiral shaped bacterium <i>borrelia burgdorferi </i>that is transmitted to humans by bites from ticks infected with the bacteria. The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can sometimes be more severe. Lyme disease has been reported from North America, Europe, Australia, China and Japan. Ticks feed by biting and attaching to the skin and sucking blood, normally from animals such as sheep and deer. Infected ticks are most likely to be encountered in heath land and lightly forested areas of North America and northern Europe. Ramblers, campers and those who work in such areas especially if they come into contact with large animals are at greatest risk of being bitten by ticks and of going on to develop disease. Cases of Lyme disease appear in Ireland every year.</P>
        <P>Many infected people have no symptoms at all. The commonest noticeable evidence of infection is a rash called <i>erythema migrans</i> that is seen in about three quarters of infected people. This red, raised skin rash develops between three days and a month after a tick bite and spreads outwards from the initial bite site. This rash can last up to a month and be several inches in diameter. People can also complain of &rsquo;flu-like symptoms such as headache, sore throat, neck stiffness, fever, muscle aches and general fatigue. Occasionally, there may be more serious symptoms involving the nervous system, joints, the heart or other tissues..</P>
        <P>Lyme disease is not a notifiable infectious disease in Ireland. This means that there is no legal requirement on doctors to report cases to their local director of public health. In Ireland, researchers have tried to determine levels of Lyme borreliosis; it has been estimated that there were about 30 human cases per year in the mid-1990s. Data, however, from the National Virus <Col N="256"/>Reference Laboratory, which is responsible for undertaking testing for <i>B. burgdorferi</i>, have confirmed that there were only 11 positive cases in 2003; these numbers have been steady at that level for the last couple of years. There were, however, more than 1,000 requests for testing for <i>B. burgdorferi</i> in 2003.</P>
        <P>Over the last several years, the NVRL confirms that virtually all positive cases were associated with travel in the US. It is felt that there is some unknown degree of under-reporting and under-diagnosis of this condition. In Britain, about 300 laboratory-confirmed cases are reported to the Health Protection Agency annually; however, estimates suggest that the true figure could be between 1,000 and 2,000 cases annually. In the US, there are about 15,000 to 20,000 cases each year.</P>
        <P>More than 100,000 cases have been reported in the US, with highest rates in New England; more than 17,000 cases were reported during 2000 alone. In Europe, similarly high rates are seen in Germany, but forested regions of Austria, Sweden and Slovenia frequently report cases as well. In England, Lyme borreliosis is considered to be endemic in the New Forest area of Hampshire.</P>
        <P>In Britain, it has been estimated that there may be as many as 1,000 human cases each year, however, in 1993, only 44 infections were voluntarily reported by laboratories in England and Wales while four were reported for Scotland. Since then, about 50 cases are reported each year in England and Wales; the true incidence, while unknown, is increasing. Over the last three years, Scotland has been detecting considerably more cases: 28 in 2001, 85 in 2002 and, provisionally, 71 in 2003.</P>
        <P>Lyme disease can affect anyone but is commonest among ramblers, hill-walkers, hikers, campers and others whose leisure activities or work takes place in heath land or light woodland areas or brings them in contact with certain animals, for example, deer. Summer and autumn is the period when most cases occur.</P>
        <P>Common antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin or erythromycin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications. Currently, there is no vaccine available against human Lyme disease in Ireland. A US human vaccine was withdrawn in 2002. Research into vaccine development is taking place in Europe and the US.</P>
        <P>It would therefore appear on initial review that despite confirmed Irish cases of Lyme borelliosis having been principally associated with travel to North America, there is the potential for individuals to be exposed to biting ticks in Ireland. It would seem sensible for this reason to recommend that simple, straightforward information should be made available that will assist those who may potentially be exposed whether as a <Col N="257"/>result of occupational or leisure activities to take necessary precautions.</P>
        <P>As a response to this in 2004, the vector-borne sub-committee of the scientific sub-committee of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre&rsquo;s scientific advisory sub-committee was established. One of its terms of reference was to identify and determine the burden of certain significant vector-borne diseases in Ireland and to make recommendations in relation to the provision of advice and guidance. One of the diseases to be considered in the work of the vector-borne sub-committee was Lyme disease.</P>
        <P>As part of the initial risk assessment the available information on Lyme disease was collated and reviewed. As in common with many other countries, estimation of true levels of this condition is rather difficult. In Ireland a number of cases appear every year and a proportion of these are likely to have been acquired in Ireland. This condition is not among the scheduled list of notifiable diseases laid out in the Infectious Diseases (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations, SI 707 of 2003, and therefore data on Lyme disease are not subject to systematic collection as is the case for notifiable diseases.</P>
        <P>A fact sheet on Lyme disease has been made available on the HPSC&rsquo;s website to provide members of the general public and media with advice on minimising the risk of Lyme disease. In addition, part of the work of the vector-borne sub-committee in the new year will be the development of clinical guidance on the management of Lyme disease and raising awareness of this condition among clinicians.</P>

	<P>The general labelling of foodstuffs in Ireland is controlled under the European Communities (Labelling, Presentation and Advertising of Foodstuffs) Regulations 2002 to 2005. These regulations apply to the labelling of pre-packaged foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer or for supply to mass caterers. The principle underlying food labelling is <Col N="258"/>that the purchaser must not be misled. Thus pre-packaged food sold at markets is not exempt from the labelling requirements that apply to such food sold by other means. However, foodstuffs sold loose, that is without pre-packaging, for example olives sold from drums or cheese sliced at the request of the consumer, need only indicate the name of the food, either on the label, or displayed on a notice near the food.</P>

	<P>I am very much aware of the negative effects, across a range of harm indicators, of harmful drinking in Irish society. A cultural shift in attitudes is required in Ireland to reduce alcohol-related harm. The international evidence is strong in that to obtain that cultural shift and to reduce alcohol harm, no one measure will work in isolation. A multidimensional and multisectoral approach across a range of settings is needed. This is why the strategic task force on alcohol was established. The task force was asked to recommend evidence based measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. The working group on alcohol established under the special initiative in Sustaining Progress will also make recommendations on a programme of actions to reduce alcohol-related harm. These recommendations and those of the STFA will address many of the proposals of the Dublin City Business Association.</P>

	<P>The Health Service Executive, HSE, has indicated that the Professionals and Citizens Network for Integrated Care, PICNIC, project commenced in January 2000 and was co-ordinated during the first phase by the Danish Centre for Health Telematics and in the second phase by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board. The purpose of this EU research project was to develop common software components which could be used on a Europe-wide basis to support integrated health care.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed my Department that Integrity Consulting Partners Ltd., were retained initially by the GMS (Payments Board) to support the Irish contribution to the process. In late 2001, when the project was under review by the Commission, Ireland was requested to assume responsibility for overall co-ordination of the project and integrity consulting worked to provide project management and technical assistance to all members of the consortium across the project as a whole.</P>
        <P>The project was completed in 2004 and the overall EU contribution was &euro;3,511,015. Of the &euro;274,000 expended on consultancy, &euro;91,000 related to project management and &euro;183,000 related to technical assistance across the project. The amount spent in 2005 in relation to the project totalled approximately &euro;3,000 in relation to project closure administration tasks.</P>
        <P>The project objectives included supporting the EU regions in the design and development of technology that would provide better integrated systems for health care. Such tools would be designed according to industry best practice in terms of systems integration, open architecture, shared benefit in terms of open source outputs and appropriate messaging standards.</P>
        <P>The HSE has noted that, in Ireland, the designs and software components developed for use here have been used by the pharmacy systems vendors as the basis for the next generation of pharmacy systems and these enable much improved communication between community pharmacies and the Health Service Executive in the interests of providing a high quality service to the public.</P>
        <P>The EU Project Review Report dated October 2003 concluded that the project had been successfully completed and that the deliverables were of good quality, that there was good use of existing internationally recognised standards and that there had been efficient project management. The EU Commission also noted that the deliverables on certification should be made widely <Col N="264"/>available. I have asked the HSE to send a copy of the Project Review Report to the Deputy.</P>

Under Article 15(1), the interim authority may appoint a person to be the chief executive officer of the interim authority. I am advised by the interim authority that its chairperson discussed the executive resourcing services that the Public Appointment Services could provide regarding the recruitment of its chief executive. The interim authority concluded that the service addressed its requirements except in the key area of a search function. Following these discussions, on 22 March 2005 the interim authority invited seven organisations, including the PAS, to tender for the provision of executive recruitment services to the interim authority for the recruitment of its chief executive officer. Following a competitive process, the interim authority approved the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers. I am committed to publishing the heads of Bill for the establishment of HIQA in the near future. The legislation will contain provisions governing the recruitment of staff, including the chief executive officer.</P>

	<P>The Irish Anaphylaxis Campaign is based in Dublin and its purpose is to promote awareness of the needs of persons suffering from various allergies. Allergic reactions occur in response to a wide variety of environmental factors including chemicals, foods and pharmaceutical preparations and can manifest themselves in a variety of ways such as skin rashes, gastrointestinal abnormalities, etc. These allergic reactions can occasionally be so severe as to lead to serious illness and death. Some of the more widely know reactions are to peanuts, fish foods and drugs such as penicillin. This is why in the healthcare setting it is vital that drug allergies are identified, recorded and highlighted on patients charts.</P>
        <P>The labelling of foodstuffs is regulated by a series of EU directives which make it obligatory for all food ingredients to be indicated on the label. A particular aim of these directives is to ensure that consumers suffering from food allergies or who wish to avoid eating certain ingredients for any other reason are informed of their presence. There is a specific requirement to mention potential allergens on food labels.</P>
        <P>The health promotion unit of my Department has no plans to run a campaign on this topic before the end of the year. Such campaigns will be a matter for the Health Service Executive from January 2006. The provision of services to individuals affected by the condition is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have <Col N="266"/>this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges for publicly funded residential care. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation using the consumer price index since the time the person involved was charged.</P>
        <P>Persons who were in publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes are covered by the terms of the Supreme Court judgment. The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 regulates the private nursing home sector. Under the nursing home subvention regulations the Health Service Executive makes a financial contribution to an individual towards the cost of his or her private nursing care provided he or she qualifies on means and dependancy grounds. The provisions of the Supreme Court judgment do not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who have entered these homes under the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
        <P>Draft heads of a Bill for a repayment scheme have been prepared and will shortly be submitted to Cabinet for approval. It is my intention to have legislation brought before the Oireachtas in the next parliamentary session and to have repayments commencing shortly after the Bill is approved and signed into law.</P>
        <P>A national oversight committee has been appointed and has already begun its work. It will provide an independent input into the design of the scheme and will monitor the operation of the scheme in order to ensure that it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible.</P>
        <P>The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified as a result of initial payments made following my announcement in December 2004. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</P>
        <P>Any person who considers that he or she or a family member may be eligible for repayment <Col N="269"/>may register his or her interest in advance with the Health Service Executive, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, County Offaly or e-mail to refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The purchase of a pendant alarm system and its monitoring are subject to the standard rate of 21%. The installation of such a system, where it includes the purchase of such an alarm, is generally subject to the reduced rate of 13.5%.</P>
        <P>Under the Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services which were in place on 1 January 1991 but cannot extend the zero rate to other goods and services. As the supply of home security systems was not subject to the zero rate on 1 January 1991, it is not possible to apply the zero rate to these goods or services. There is no provision in EU VAT law that would allow for the abolition of VAT on home security systems.</P>
        <P>However, I would add that under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Monitoring and maintenance fees are not recoverable. Applicants should contact the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayments, Unregistered Section, Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, a scheme of community support for older people is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage and assist the community&rsquo;s support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding under the scheme can be provided for small scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling; for security lighting; for smoke alarms; and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme.</P>
        <P>The VAT refund for the purchase of a personal security alarm by or on behalf of a disabled or elderly person combined with the scheme of community support for older people outlined above <Col N="270"/>are important measures that go towards ensuring that those who are most in need of security systems can avail of them.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no general tax pension relieving provisions aimed specifically at employed carers. However, the general tax pension relieving provisions as apply to employees will apply to employed carers. First, an employee who is not in a Revenue approved occupational pension scheme may effect either: (a) a retirement annuity contract; or (b) a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, and claim tax relief, subject to certain restrictions, in respect of his or her contributions to such schemes.</P>
        <P>Second, where an employer has in place a Revenue approved occupational pension scheme, under Chapter 1, Part 30 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the employee may claim, subject to certain restrictions, tax relief on his or her contributions to such scheme. With effect from 13 <Col N="271"/>September 2003, where an employer does not provide an occupational pension scheme or an additional voluntary contribution facility, such employer must provide access for an employee to at least one standard PRSA and the policing of this rests with the Pensions Board.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme announced in budget 2004 provides for the transfer of 10,300 Civil Service and public sector posts from Dublin to other locations. Almost all Departments are involved, either wholly or partly. A number of semi-State organisations are also involved in the programme.</P>
        <P>There are a number of cases in which Civil Service unions and staff are seeking confined competitions to appoint unestablished staff, who are in many instances employed on contract, to established posts within the Civil Service. Policy in regard to decentralisation in these cases is being developed in the context of a draft agreement on promotions which has been under discussion between management and the Civil Service unions for some time.</P>
        <P>This draft agreement covers both interdepartmental promotion competitions and internal promotions. In regard to interdepartmental promotions, all appointees from such competitions must agree to relocate with their new post. In regard to internal promotions, where a Department is decentralising in its entirety, from 52 weeks before decentralisation, all promotions in the Department will be made on the basis of a written commitment by promotees to relocate; where a Department is partially decentralising, from 52 weeks before decentralisation, one-half of all promotions will be made on that basis.</P>
        <P>Pending final agreement with Civil Service unions and to ensure that the staffing needs of Departments and offices continue to be met, interdepartmental competitions are currently being held on the basis of this draft agreement. In addition, Departments and offices have been asked by the Department of Finance to follow the procedures in the draft in regard to internal promotions. It is expected that the agreement will be finalised shortly.</P><Col N="272"/>
        <P>As the general principle that promotees should be asked to agree to decentralise is now being implemented in both interdepartmental and internal promotions in accordance with the draft agreement, it is clearly essential that the possibility of applying the same condition in the cases of contract staff applying for established posts should also be considered. These cases are being examined by the Department of Finance and the relevant Departments and offices. They are also being discussed with the relevant trade unions.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the decentralisation programme is voluntary; that is, staff may opt to decentralise with their post or to another post in a decentralised location, or they may opt to remain in Dublin.</P>

	<P>Provisions regarding annual leave in the Civil Service are set out in circulars issued by my Department from time to time. The most recent circular was 27/03 issued in 2003, a copy of which I have arranged to be supplied to the Deputy. Minimum legal entitlements regarding annual leave are determined by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which are reflected as appropriate in Civil Service provisions. In general, Civil Service annual leave arrangements are more beneficial than the minimum requirements provided for in that Act.</P>
        <P>Civil Service policy with regard to staff who resign or retire is that every effort should be made to ensure that such officers are facilitated in taking any annual leave entitlement, including carryover leave, in advance of ceasing employment including, for example, the completion of a period of annual leave immediately prior to retirement. Where, despite such efforts, a portion <Col N="273"/>of an officer&rsquo;s annual leave allowance remains untaken at the point of cessation of service, payment at rates specified in circular 27/03 may be made in respect of the untaken portion.</P>

	<P>Security of supply in regard to energy is a key policy objective. The relatively small size of our national electricity market heightens the need for greater interconnection as a means of enhancing security of supply, promoting competition and integrating the Irish electricity market into the wider European market. In this context, it remains my intention to progress the development of east-west electricity interconnection with Great Britain as a matter of priority.</P>
        <P>At my request, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, explored the options for the development of east-west electricity interconnection. The CER appointed consultants to advise on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects of the development. The report of the consultants, which is now complete, includes a technical and legal review and a consideration of regulatory and procurement aspects. A consultation process was also undertaken with parties who expressed an interest.</P>
        <P>A decision on how best to take the east-west electricity interconnection project forward, be it on a regulated or a hybrid regulated or merchant basis, is the next step and such determination will be informed by the advice of the CER in the matter, which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
        <P>The development of an east-west electricity interconnection would also, in theory at least, increase the capacity of wind powered electricity generating plants which could connect to the national grid without compromising system security. However the actual increased capacity which could be connected after the commissioning of an east-west electricity interconnection will depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of wind powered capacity connected to Great Britain, the nature and point of the interconnection and protocols for operating the interconnection and accessing or allocating the available capacity. Pending a decision on how best to take the east-west electricity interconnection project forward and subsequent decisions, it is premature to speculate on the additional wind powered capacity that might be connected subsequently without compromising system security.</P><Col N="274"/>
        <P>In the near term the priority is to launch the renewable energy feed in tariff, REFIT, support measure to ensure we more than double the amount of renewable energy powered electricity plant connected to the electricity network from 675 MW currently to 1,450 MW by 2010.</P>
        <P>Proposed terms and conditions of the REFIT programme were posted on my Department&rsquo;s website, <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie,</i> for public comment last September. Approximately 30 responses were received. Those submissions have been evaluated and incorporated into the REFIT programme where appropriate.</P>
        <P>We are currently seeking legal advice on a proposed finalised document to launch REFIT. It will be published as soon as legal approval is received and after the practical arrangements to print and make available the detailed notes are completed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Policy with respect to landings by foreign military aircraft is based on the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952. This gives the Minister for Foreign Affairs discretion in the granting of permission to foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State. Permission is normally granted on certain conditions, such as that the aircraft is unarmed, is not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, is not engaged in intelligence gathering and is not taking part in military exercises or operations. These conditions are not legal requirements but are policy stipulations which are applied at the discretion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and which can be waived or varied at any time. On the other hand, policy with respect to landings by civilian aircraft is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I have consistently made it clear that if anyone has evidence to demonstrate that prisoners have been wrongly and unlawfully transferred through Irish territory, then that evidence should be given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I am not aware of any such evidence. The matter would then become an issue of law enforcement, albeit with an interstate dimension.</P>
        <P>During my visit to the United States last week, I met the US Secretary of State, Dr Condoleezza Rice, in Washington DC. I raised with her the allegations that have been made regarding the rendition of prisoners and the use of Irish air<Col N="275"/>ports. As the Taoiseach made clear to the House earlier this week, the Secretary of State confirmed the assurances that we have previously received from the US authorities that prisoners have not been &ldquo;rendered&rdquo; through Irish airports or airspace, nor would they be, without the permission of the Irish authorities first being sought. No such request for permission has been received.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. The old age non-contributory pension scheme is one of the schemes affected. The basis for the restriction contained in the new rules is the applicant&rsquo;s habitual residence. The restriction is not based on citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other factor.</P>
        <P>The effect of the restriction is that a person whose habitual residence is in the United States, Europe, Africa or elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments, including old age non-contributory pensions, on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person&rsquo;s habitual residence is decided in accordance with European Court of <Col N="278"/>Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.</P>
        <P>Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of the guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a deciding officer has the right to appeal to the social welfare appeals office. The habitual residence condition does not affect missionaries returning to Ireland on a permanent basis. They still qualify immediately for an old age pension or any other social welfare support on the same basis as heretofore if they meet the standard criteria.</P>
        <P>The application of the habitual residence condition has to be compatible with EU law and other international and national legal obligations and it is not possible in applying the condition to discriminate in favour of any particular group or nationality. It is not possible to waive the habitual residence requirement in respect of Irish missionaries who return home on holiday.</P>
        <P>While exact details of the occupation of claimants assessed under the habitual residence condition are not maintained, it is estimated that 206 old age non-contributory pension claims made by religious have been decided on since 1 May 2004. Of these cases, 142 were deemed to satisfy the habitual residence condition, while 64 were found not to satisfy the condition.</P>
        <P>The habitual residence condition is being operated in a very careful manner to ensure that the social welfare system is not open to everyone who is newly arrived in Ireland, while at the same time ensuring that people whose cases are appropriate to the Irish social welfare system have access to the system when they need it.</P>

	<P>The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1 May 2004. A central unit was set up to monitor the implementation of the habitual residence condition. An important function of the central unit is to make decisions on complex cases. The unit also provides advice and support, on an ongoing basis, to staff in social welfare offices and scheme areas. This includes circulation of guidelines and updates on the administration of the scheme as appropriate. Decisions to the effect that applicants satisfy the habitual residence condition are made in the majority of cases at claim acceptance stage by deciding officers at local level throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Since 1 August 2005, decisions on child benefit cases have been dealt with in child benefit section in Letterkenny and from 7 November 2005, decisions on disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance have been made in Longford headquarters. At present, decisions on complex cases for other scheme types are being made in the central unit. In the period from May 2004 to 2 December, a total of 25,026 complex cases have been decided. Some 75% of these cases were found to satisfy the habitual residence condition.</P>
        <P>My Department has carried out a number of measures to reduce the time taken to process complex cases dealt with in the central unit. These include the deployment of additional temporary staff, the use of overtime and the setting up of fast tracking decision for cases where appropriate. These measures, combined with the devolution of decision-making on all child benefit, disability allowance and carer&rsquo;s allowance cases to the relevant scheme section have achieved a significant reduction in the number of cases on hand in the central unit and claim processing times.</P>
        <P>The operation of the habitual residence condition has been kept under review by officials of my Department since its introduction. The pur<Col N="281"/>pose of the review is to assess the impact of the condition on different categories of claimants, the organisational arrangements and the level of service provided to customers, to identify opportunities for improvements in the administration of the scheme and identify emerging policy issues and consider how these should be addressed.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 158 to 161, inclusive, on 1 December 2005.</P>
        <P>The planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the specification of standards under section 19 of the Roads Act 1993, is a matter for the NRA. I understand that the NRA&rsquo;s design manual for roads and bridges, which was originally published in December 2000, contains standards and advice notes relating to the design, assessment and operation of national roads in Ireland. The NRA requires that the design manual be used on all projects for the construction and or improvement of national roads. While the design manual is not a statutory document, the NRA, as the agency with responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national roads network and the funding of individual projects, requires that the technical standards specified in the document be adhered to.</P>
        <P>The NRA&rsquo;s specification for road works, which was originally published in March 2000, contains detailed specifications for all elements of road works. The full document or relevant parts are included as part of the contract documents for individual road construction or improvement projects and must therefore be complied with as a contractual obligation. While the design manual and specification are intended primarily for use on national roads, I understand that the documents may be used, at the discretion of road authorities, on non-national roads.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are no statutory minimum standards for road resurfacing. I am informed that the NRA&rsquo;s specification for road works and design manual for roads and bridges include requirements in terms of road surfacing and re-surfacing. Guidance and recommendations regarding the provision and use of warning signs for road works, including road surfacing and surface dressing <Col N="282"/>operations, are set out in chapter eight of the traffic signs manual published by my Department.</P>
        <P>The present manual, which constitutes a direction given to road authorities by the Minister for Transport pursuant to section 95 (16) of the Road Traffic Act 1961, is currently the subject of a comprehensive review. A draft of the chapter of the manual relating to the traffic sign system applied at roadwork sites has been prepared. The draft document is now in the process of being issued to local authorities and other interested parties to afford them the opportunity to provide input before its publication, which is expected in the first quarter of 2006.</P>

Design work on phase one, a spur from the Maynooth line at Clonsilla to Pace, will be undertaken by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann during 2006 and I expect to receive a business case for the project before the end of 2006. The company will also commence studies on the extension of the line to Navan and will report to me on the matter. The necessary funding in respect of the design work and the studies will be provided in my Department&rsquo;s Estimates in 2006.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The exemption to which the Deputy is referring arises from a Government amendment proposed and accepted on D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Equality Bill 2004. The Bill, which was subsequently enacted as the Equality Act 2004, implemented Council Directive 2000/78/EC &mdash; employment directive.</P>
        <P>Aer Lingus sought the amendment to protect and underpin existing collective agreements with the trade unions that provide for seniority of staff <Col N="283"/>in Aer Lingus. Those existing agreements provide that, for staff recruited on the same day, their seniority is determined by age. In effect, it is a tie-breaker agreed collectively between staff and employers.</P>
        <P>My Department facilitated and attended a meeting between Aer Lingus and IBEC and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the issue on behalf of Aer Lingus and other employers. On foot of that meeting and following legal advice sought by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a Government amendment was proposed and accepted on D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Bill. The amendment was designed to protect the industry structure agreement from a challenge on age discrimination grounds and is in compliance with Article 6 of the framework employment directive, 2000/78/EC, which permits differences of treatment on age grounds where these are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim.</P>

	<P>Concerns have been expressed to me about modifications to motor vehicles involving excessively blacked-<Col N="284"/>out windows and noisy exhaust systems and it has been suggested that modifications should be made to the NCT to address these concerns. To do so would require amendments to the construction, equipment and use of vehicles regulations and the NCT regulations. However, before such amendments could be made, it would be necessary to develop technical standards in relation to the opacity of glazing and exhaust noise emissions.

Following an application for authorisation, the European Food Safety Authority published an opinion in September 2004 concerning the use of formaldehyde in feed for fattening chickens. Despite this opinion, which was mostly favourable, the Commission expressed concerns about the use of the additive and referred the matter for further scientific evaluation. This new evaluation is ongoing, and in the meantime, formaldehyde is not currently authorised for use in chicken feed.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The recent agreement on the reform of the EU sugar regime provides for partial compensation, to be paid as part of the single payment scheme, for beet growers for the drop in the minimum price of beet. In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once off payment of almost &euro;44 million would be available for growers and a restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The agreement provides that 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Beef production is extremely valuable to the Irish economy with a &euro;1.4 billion export <Col N="289"/>value representing almost 25% of total Irish agri-food exports. In 2004, Ireland produced 560,000 tonnes of beef and exported 495,000 tonnes. Almost 90% of these exports went to EU markets with this trend continuing in 2005. The outlook for 2006 is for Irish beef production to increase by 5%, contrasting with a decreasing production trend throughout continental Europe. The overall EU beef market is again forecast to remain in deficit next year by approximately 350,000 tonnes. This will create a positive market environment and should maintain good demand for Irish beef in our key markets with good prices being achieved. The shift in recent years to EU markets for the vast bulk of our beef exports strengthens our position from a strategic point of view as an increased presence in this sophisticated high value market is seen as the key to the success of the beef industry in the long term.</P>
        <P>The 2003 mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy has allowed Irish beef farmers to farm exclusively for the market as premia have been replaced with a single decoupled payment. Farmers can now specialise in enterprises at which they have a comparative advantage with no limiting forms of production save the supply and demand balance of the marketplace. Our ability to grow grass over a long growing season and our mild climate will ensure that we remain a significant producer of cattle in the future.</P>
        <P>Third country markets also continue to play a role and my Department in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia continues to make every effort to increase the number of markets for Irish beef. Russia, Algeria and Egypt are important destinations for our beef while the Lebanon is an importer of live cattle from Ireland. Similar work is ongoing in regard to opportunities for trade with countries in the Gulf states, South Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines and other potential markets in which there are restrictions on Irish and EU beef due to BSE. I am committed to having the maximum number of international markets available to Irish beef and my Department will continue to work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to achieve that aim.</P>
        <P>I recently announced the commencement of a study of the sheep sector and its needs, in the context of our new premia-free environment. It is important to identify the changes that are needed in the various strategies to make them more effective in the future environment and to draw together a cohesive development plan that will put the industry on a solid footing in the post decoupling era. It is largely industry led and is being overseen by a steering group representing the main interests in the sector.</P>
        <P>This study will cover all facets of the industry from farm production through to processing and marketing and will focus on economic and regulatory issues. The objective is to progress the competitiveness and profitable growth potential <Col N="290"/>of the sheep sector in Ireland and avoid seasonal disparities such as occurred this year. I welcome this study and would be hopeful that it will bring stability and confidence to the sector with benefits for all concerned.</P>
        <P>Producers in the pig sector are operating at a high level of efficiency. The Prospectus study, which reported in 2001, was a comprehensive examination of the factors relevant to the future prosperity of the sector, in particular its competitiveness on home and international markets. The key recommendation centred on the need for rationalisation of primary processing facilities. There has been a good degree of rationalisation of processing structures in the past couple of years and I believe the sector is well positioned to take on the challenges that lie ahead.</P>
        <P>My Department is, and will continue to be, engaged in a wide range of activities that are critical to the ongoing development of the pig industry. These include national animal health programmes, the monitoring of compliance with food safety controls at production premises, the administration of production controls and certification for individual third country markets, and improving access to new markets. Pigmeat also features prominently on Bord Bia&rsquo;s programme of promotion on home and export markets.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the nitrates directive presents challenges for the pig sector. In that context I have announced a suite of measures, for which the approval of the European Commission is awaited, to assist producers to comply with the directive. These include the extension of the farm waste management scheme to pig producers for the first time. Other elements include grant aid for specialised slurry handling and spreading equipment and dry feeding systems. Having enough land on which to spread manure is a related issue facing farmers. In that context I will be asking Teagasc to undertake a very active promotion campaign to demonstrate the nutrient value of slurry and the savings that farmers can achieve by substituting it for chemical fertiliser. I will be urging REPS planners to encourage their clients to use pig manure on their farms. I have also launched a new aid scheme this year, the pig welfare scheme, to facilitate compliance with new welfare standards for the housing of sows.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the many measures outlined above will greatly assist the ongoing development of the beef, lamb and pig meat industries.</P>

	<P>The development of new markets for Irish food produce is primarily the responsibility <Col N="291"/>of the food industry itself. Having said that, my Department, in co-operation with the statutory food promotion agency, Bord Bia, will continue to assist the industry to identify markets for Irish agricultural and food produce in the EU and internationally, to build on existing markets in terms of extending the value-added component, to identifying market segments with growth potential and to innovate to retain consumer and buyer interest.</P>
        <P>In the past year, I worked closely with the development agencies and the industry on the successful trade visit to China which was led by the Taoiseach and on a trade visit to the United States, which gave me a deep understanding of the potential of these markets, the pace of transformation of the economies and the key role played by research. The visit to China resulted in the signing of a protocol to facilitate Irish trade in pork products and marked a further step in building beneficial trading relationships.</P>
        <P>Closer to home, I was pleased to promote value-added meat products identified as Irish in French supermarket chains and subsequently, in September, to launch the Bord Bia &ldquo;Irish Beef in Europe&rdquo; campaign, which is aimed at building sales of Irish beef in European supermarkets and establishing the &ldquo;Irish Beef&rdquo; brand firmly in the minds of consumers. Initial feedback is encouraging in terms of improved demand. This promotional work by Bord Bia coupled with the marketing effort of the industry will be continued in order to build further sustainable market share in Europe which is where the future long-term success of the Irish beef industry lies.</P>
        <P>Regarding third country trade in primary products, my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia, continues to make every effort to increase the number of markets for Irish beef. Russia, Algeria and Egypt are important markets for our beef while the Lebanon is an importer of live cattle. A delegation from my Department and Bord Bia visited Egypt in August this year to finalise negotiations in this area with the Egyptian authorities. This resulted in the signing of a new protocol on animal health matters to improve the conditions under which exports to that country can take place. A special export refund has also been maintained to support the beef trade to Egypt. To-date, 1,900 tonnes of beef have been shipped to this destination under the new arrangements.</P>
        <P>Markets change at home as well as abroad and during 2005, I asked Bord Bia to assess the market opportunities and changing patterns of consumer demand in the horticulture sector. The call for investment proposals subsequently issued by my Department attracted a strong response, and the proposals submitted are being evaluated on a competitive basis following which decisions will be taken on the award of grant aid.</P>

	<P>It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime, on which political agreement was reached by the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 24 November 2005. The main features of the reform agreement are as follows: a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed &mdash; 36% instead of 39%; a phasing-in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed; an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years; a once-off payment worth almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland; and an aid package of up to &euro;145 million for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. The entire compensation package for Ireland has an estimated value in excess of &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>In the event that sugar production ceases in Ireland, a once-off payment of almost &euro;44 million would be available for growers. Also, the restructuring fund of up to &euro;145 million would become available to provide compensation for the economic, social and environmental costs arising from factory closure. The reform agreement provides that at least 10% of the fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors to compensate notably for losses arising from investment in specialised machinery. This amount may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties as long as the financial breakdown of the elements of the restructuring plan is kept balanced according to a sound economic proposal.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, sugar beet is grown by 3,700 farmers and it is estimated that approximately 1,000 people are employed in sugar processing and ancillary activities.</P>

	<P>The recent agreement by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in relation to reform of <Col N="293"/>the EU sugar regime was the culmination of a protracted and difficult negotiating process. The outcome, in my view, represents the best possible deal that could have been achieved for Irish beet growers in the circumstances and is a considerable improvement on the Commission&rsquo;s initial proposals of last June. The main features of the agreement are as follows: a lower reduction in the support price of sugar than originally proposed &mdash; 36% instead of 39%; a phasing-in of the corresponding reduction in the minimum sugar beet price over four years, instead of the two-step reduction originally proposed; an increased rate of compensation for beet growers of up to 64% of the price reduction, to be paid in the form of direct payments worth approximately &euro;121 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years; a once-off payment worth almost &euro;44 million exclusively for beet growers in the event that sugar beet production ceases in Ireland; and the aid package of up to &euro;145 million for economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the Irish sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. The entire compensation package for Ireland has an estimated value in excess of &euro;300 million.</P>
        <P>It will be a matter for beet growers and Irish Sugar Limited to make decisions about sugar beet growing in light of the reformed sugar regime.

        <P>The formal legal texts giving effect to the agreement will be adopted by the Council of Ministers early next year after the opinion of the European Parliament has been received. The Commission will then come forward with proposals for detailed implementing rules. Pending the adoption of the relevant regulations it is not possible to give further definitive information but, as with the earlier phases of CAP reform, my Department will make timely arrangements for implementing the new regime in due course.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Exports of Irish dairy products amounted to &euro;1.86 billion last year, representing some 24% of total Irish food and drink exports. This was an increase of some 6% over the previous year. With increasing global demand for dairy products forecast by the OECD of up to 2% per annum the future prospects for Irish dairy products on world markets remain positive.</P>
        <P>The consistency with which the dairy sector has continued to prosper, driven by new investment, innovation and diversification, has been very impressive. Export dominated, the sector sells more than 80% of total output onto world markets across a broad category of products including butter, milk powders, cheese, infant formula, food ingredients and functional foods. New investment in research and development will continue the drive towards greater levels of innovation and diversity in product mix and will help maintain our competitiveness in the face of stiffer challenges ahead.</P>
        <P>New intervention limits and reductions in institutional prices imposed by the Luxembourg Agreement has focused the industry on the need to become less reliant on commodity products and to increase the added value nature of output. With the ever-growing globalisation of world markets, it is vital that the period ahead is used by the Irish dairy industry to position itself to meet the demands of a more competitive marketplace. In the meantime, I will continue to exert pressure at EU level to ensure that all the market mechanisms available are deployed in an effective manner to ensure that the industry will continue to consolidate and grow its share of international markets.</P>

	<P>Detailed EU legislation lays down the conditions that member states must apply to the production of and trade in products of animal origin, including meat and meat extracts, as well as to imports of these products from third countries.</P>
        <P>Under harmonised legislation, a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the member states to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health. The application of these standards in the member states is monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office, FVO, of the EU. It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade <Col N="295"/>between, member states. All such imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU.</P>
        <P>The FVO carries out inspections to ensure that only establishments that meet hygiene and health standards equivalent to those operating within the EU are approved. Where the FVO considers that public health requirements are not being met, an establishment may be removed from the EU approved list. If outbreaks of animal diseases occur in a third country, approval to export to the EU is suspended for the infected regions of the country, or the whole country, as appropriate, until the disease risk has been eliminated.</P>
        <P>I support fully the policy that animal products imported into the EU from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, EU member states. Irish farmers are required to ensure that their production systems and farm practices fully comply with a wide range of EU directives on important matters including traceability, animal health and welfare and consumer protection.</P>
        <P>In this context, I wrote to the Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr. Markos Kyprianou, concerning the sanitary rules applying to the import of livestock products, especially beef, into the European Union. In his reply, the Commissioner outlined that, with respect to traceability and controls of residues of veterinary medicines, the purpose of EU legislation is not to impose on exporting third countries a system of guarantees that is equal to the EU system, but that the exporting country provides guarantees that are equivalent to the standards applied in the EU. The Commissioner indicated his service is committed to protect the health of European consumers and European livestock. The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.</P>

	<P>The Department of Agriculture and Food takes a robust attitude to the prevention of the introduction of animal diseases into Ireland, as exemplified by the range of measures being taken to prevent the introduction of avian influenza into the country. The Department has put in place a specific range of measures, including EU and national measures, aimed at minimising <Col N="296"/>any risk of avian influenza being introduced into the country and, in the event of an outbreak, ensuring its early detection and speedy eradication. As migratory wild birds can potentially play a role in spreading the virus, much of the Department&rsquo;s focus has been on early detection and speedy eradication. The introduction of an &ldquo;early warning system&rdquo; and the registration of all holdings and sites on which domestic poultry or captive birds are kept are vital components of the Department&rsquo;s strategy. All live commercial animals imported into Ireland from an EU member state or a third country must be accompanied by an official health certificate from the competent authority of the exporting country, confirming that the animals have undergone all appropriate tests and have not come from an area affected by an animal disease. Veterinary inspection checks operate at all Ireland&rsquo;s official border inspection posts to ensure that imports meet physical, documentary and identity requirements. I am satisfied that the range of safeguards and protection measures in place are comprehensive and minimise any possibility of animal disease being introduced here. Such measures are kept under constant review. The Department will not hesitate to introduce any additional measures which are considered appropriate to meet an increased threat of animal disease being introduced.</P>

	<P>I commissioned the auctioneering and estate agency review group in July 2004 to examine the future licensing and regulatory requirements of property practitioners against a background of serious public concern about certain selling practices in the property industry. When the group invited submissions from the public about its work, experiences similar to those detailed with this question were <Col N="297"/>among the complaints received. The group&rsquo;s report of July 2005 made a number of recommendations aimed at protecting consumers from practices like gazumping. It noted that it is sellers who gazump and barring any changes to the law of contract, it will always be the right of individual sellers to raise or lower their price demands or to withdraw their property from sale. It will always be the right of buyers to reduce purchase offers or to back away from a purchase until the point at which contracts have been signed and exchanged. In its Report on Gazumping, the Law Reform Commission, after extensive examination of the issue, concluded that &ldquo;the only practicable reforms are to take steps to inform buyers, and in that way, to protect them&rdquo;. The group noted that a problem arises if a developer who has accepted a large number of deposits pulls out of the sale at a later stage to relaunch the scheme at a higher price. The group described that practice as reprehensible and argued that it should cease. It recommended that all builders and developers should stand over conditionally agreed sale prices. It cited the home purchase protection pledge issued by members of the Irish Home Builders&rsquo; Association as a model for appropriate behaviour between buyer and seller that should be enforced throughout the sector.</P>
        <P>I am taking steps, with the approval of the Government, to establish a new regulatory authority that will assume responsibility for the licensing and regulation of all auctioneering, estate agency, property letting and property management service providers. The new authority will not be responsible for regulating the behaviour of builders and developers, but it will have a consumer information function aimed at ensuring that consumers entering into contracts such as that described in the Deputy&rsquo;s question understand the rights and entitlements, or otherwise, which are conferred on each party by the payment of a deposit. If an auctioneer is acting as an agent in such transactions, it is intended that the regulatory authority will have an oversight function relating to the services he or she provides. It will also make a complaints mechanism available to people who have not achieved satisfaction through existing mechanisms. It is further intended that the regulatory authority will develop contacts with other regulatory and representative bodies, such as the Construction Industry Federation, to encourage the development of the fullest possible protection for consumers in this area.</P>

	<P>During the passage of the Equality Bill 2004 through the Oireachtas, an issue was raised by IBEC about a difficulty with the application of the age ground under the Employment Equality Act 1998 for certain practices operated in Aer Lingus and other employments. Representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform subsequently met representatives of IBEC, Aer Lingus and the Department of Transport to examine the issue further. Legal advice confirmed that there was an existing problem arising from the provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age in the Employment Equality Act 1998. If two workers have the same length of service, but certain advantages are given to the older worker by virtue of a collective agreement, it is possible that it can be seen as discrimination on the basis of age, contrary to the provisions of the 1998 Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A Government amendment was proposed and accepted on Committee Stage of the Equality Bill 2004 in the D&aacute;il to insert a new subsection 7(A) in section 34 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The purpose of the amendment was to clarify that, for the purposes of section 34(7) of the 1998 Act, &ldquo;relative seniority&rdquo; may be determined having regard to the respective ages of employees at the time of their recruitment, if all other matters are equal and it is accepted as part of a collective agreement. The provision is in compliance with Article 6 of the EU framework employment directive, which permits differences of treatment on the age ground if they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim. The effect of subsection 7(A) is to provide for the continued validity of certain age related provisions if they have been agreed collectively by employers and employees. It is recognised, as IBEC confirmed to officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that situations can arise in the employment of staff in which it is difficult to determine relative seniority based on length of service. This can happen if a number of staff are recruited at the same time to the same category of post or employment. A &ldquo;tie-breaker&rdquo; situation can arise in such cases. If the tie-breaker agreed between staff and employers in the context of a collective agreement is based on the relative ages of the employees at that time, it is appropriate to exclude such agreed arrangements from unlawful discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004. It is <Col N="301"/>open to employees and employers to change any such arrangement, should they so agree.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The project was a community-based, day assessment service which offered an assessment service to young people from Finglas, Ballymun and surrounding areas. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the probation and welfare service, commenced funding the project on 1 January 2004, at an annual cost of &euro;400,000. Prior to that date, funding had been provided by the Department of Education and Science from the children at risk fund.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform agreed to commence funding the project on condition, <i>inter alia</i>, that: the project should be a pilot for day centres, provided for under the Children Act 2001; referrals to the project should be from the courts; and the project should work to its full capacity of five young people in attendance at any given time. It was anticipated that the project would become a pilot day centre as provided for under the Children Act 2001. <Col N="303"/>However, in order to meet the day centre requirement of the Children Act a number of changes were required to the existing services being provided by the project. Unfortunately, I am informed that the project was unable to meet those requirements. I am further informed that since January 2004, the project has only dealt with six referrals of young people who were before the courts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am advised that, at a meeting held on 2 December 2005 the board of management concluded that the project was no longer viable and that the company should cease trading on 8 December 2005. I am further advised the board decided that staff should be paid until the end of December in lieu of notice. As the project is registered as a private limited company, the severance package and any staff issues arising are a matter entirely for the board of management. In that regard, I understand that negotiations with the relevant parties are due to commence very shortly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have instructed the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform urgently to pursue with the management of the probation and welfare service what alternative programmes can be put in place for the provision of services to children in the Finglas, Ballymun and surrounding areas who are under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The individuals in question arrived in the State on 23 May 1999, accompanied by one of their dependants, and made an asylum application on 24 May 1999. They had a child in November 1999 and withdrew their asylum application in November 2000. They successfully applied for permission to reside in Ireland based solely on their parentage of an Irish-born child. They were granted permission to remain on 11 April 2000. The visa application in question relates to a 12-year-old son who wishes to join them in the State. They also have two other children residing in Nigeria.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L and O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to <Col N="304"/>reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members should no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not generally approve visas in respect of such visa applications.</P>

	<P>Marriage to an Irish national does not confer any automatic right of residency in the State. However, it is possible to make an application for permission to remain in the State based solely on the separate basis of marriage to an Irish national. In this regard the person in question made an application for residency in the State based solely on marriage to an Irish national in April 2004.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In order to prevent abuses of the system, in so far as is possible and without unduly interfering with the Irish national&rsquo;s private circumstances, the immigration division will seek to establish and confirm various matters. These include the context in which the marriage took place, the validity of the marriage and whether the couple are residing in a family unit. It is a requirement of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the non-EU national spouse of an Irish national be residing in the same household in a family unit with the Irish national in order to acquire residency solely on that basis.</P>
        <P>The Department&rsquo;s primary concern in this matter is to maintain the integrity of the immigration system. Convenience marriages for the purpose of circumventing normal immigration controls are experienced by immigration jurisdictions worldwide and, in this regard, holiday and Internet romances would feature frequently. This application from the person in question was considered and it was discovered that he is not residing, and has never resided, in the same household in a family unit with his spouse since the date of his marriage. As he did not qualify for the residency on the separate basis of marriage to an Irish national, a notification of refusal on that basis issued on 25 November 2005.</P>
        <P>Since the person in question and his dependent child do not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction, the letter of 25 November 2005 also contained a notification of <Col N="305"/>a proposal to deport them from the State under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. It is open to the person in question to make representations regarding that proposal as to why he should not be deported from the State within 15 working days of the date of the letter. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order, the person in question will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 218 together.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The working group on the weight of schoolbags, in its report presented in 1998, indicated that little is known about the short or long-term consequences of load-carrying by children. The report referred to a number of studies which had been carried out on the matter of the weight of schoolbags. However, the report stated that the association between lifting and carrying and back pain in children has not been established.</P>
        <P>As I informed the Deputy in my answer to Question No. 555 of 22 November 2005, my Department initiated an awareness-raising campaign by disseminating the report of the working group with an accompanying circular to all primary and post-primary schools in 1998. A further circular was issued this year, again highlighting the potential health hazard of heavy schoolbags. The most recent circular also outlined <Col N="309"/>a range of local measures that could be adopted by schools in order to alleviate the problem. In addition, page two of the report of the working group outlined positive actions which had been taken by some schools.</P>
        <P>I consider that the range of actions as already notified to schools is adequate to enable them to select those measures that would be most suited to each school&rsquo;s individual needs.</P>

A review of the long-term enrolment at the school has recently been completed.

        <Quest> further to Question No. 554 of 22 November 2005, her views on whether it would be more effective to supply individual schools with sufficient circulars in order that one could be given to each child rather than expect the schools to make copies for each family; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">My Department normally issues one copy of a circular to each school. In some instances, where the subject matter is likely to be of particular interest or concern to the parent body, the school is asked to provide a copy of the circular to the appropriate representatives of parents, normally the parents&rsquo; council, for transmission to individual parents. In this way both the school authorities and the parents&rsquo; council have discretion over whether they consider it necessary to provide individual copies of a circular to all parents.</P>
        <P>In general it is not considered necessary for copies of individual circulars to issue to all parents. In many instances it would be considerably more effective for the school authorities or the parents&rsquo; council, through normal means of communication, to inform parents of the general content of relevant circulars and of the easy availability of circulars on my Department&rsquo;s website. Schools will generally also make copies of circulars available to parents on request.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the subject matter of the circular in question, namely, the weight of schoolbags, I consider that this is a much more effective means of disseminating information than asking each child to carry home a copy of the circular. Copies of circulars are also sent to the education partners, including the national parents' councils.</P>

However, it is recognised that books have to be changed periodically to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Government is strongly committed to improving participation and achievement at every level of education. We have put the resources and supports in place to ensure a wide range of course options is available in the further and higher education sectors for young people who wish to continue their studies after second-level and for people returning to education later in life. Post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses represent one such option. The Government&rsquo;s support for this important sector is clear from the fact that we have increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188.</P>
        <P>Government support for the sector is evident not only in the expansion of approved places and teachers, but also in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998. Tuition fees for PLC courses are waived. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. Approximately 8,000 PLC grant holders will receive some &euro;23 million in direct support in 2005. Other developments funded by my Department of direct benefit to the PLC sector include the provision of national certification under the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the development of progression links with higher education in the Institutes of Technology.</P>
        <P>PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplemental non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This will amount to &euro;5.5 million in 2005. Government commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers&rsquo; pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is significant.</P>
        <P>The McIver report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. Having regard to the number and scope of the recommendations in the report, extensive consultations were held with management and staff interests with regard to issues such as the prioritisation of recommendations, the <Col N="314"/>structural changes envisaged in the report, their implications and associated costs in the context of the overall provision of resources for further and adult education. Active consideration is being given to all the issues involved. While this work is ongoing, extra investment has been provided in the 2006 Estimates to develop the PLC sector further and to improve supports for other aspects of further and adult education.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Estimates include provision for the cost of the extra 100 teaching posts for the post-leaving certificate colleges in the current academic year. They also provide for an increase of 19% in the VTOS non-pay grant in 2006. This Government has shown a sustained determination to expand and improve further and adult education over recent years. We believe strongly in the value of this sector and will continue to prioritise it for resources and supports in the years ahead.</P>

        <P>Under the scheme a grant is tenable for the normal duration of the approved PLC course and is renewable annually subject to the satisfactory participation, attendance and the approval of the Vocational Education Committee.

	<P Just="Left">I should explain that the sick pay arrangements for civilian employees of my Department apply to this person. In general, civilian employees may be granted up to six months&rsquo; sick leave at full pay in any period of 12 months and half-pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of 12 months sick leave of any kind, full pay, half-pay or without pay, in any period of four years or less. Civilian employees are also eligible for disability benefit while absent due to sickness. In such cases, these employees retain their full entitlement to paid sick leave but submit applications through the Department&rsquo;s human resources branch to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for disability benefit. For the duration of the period that an employee is on paid sick leave, the disability benefit payments are forwarded to my Department. Disability benefit payments issue directly to an employee when they have exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave under the terms of the Department&rsquo;s sick pay scheme for civilian employees. I understand that this person has exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave. The information requested by the employee relating to ill-health retirement will be issued shortly.</P>

        <askee>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</askee>
        <Quest>the reason a group water scheme with over 1,500 members using 700,000 gallons of water per day on average is being forced into a DBO bundle when a nearby town scheme with less than half the water needs can go it alone; if it is EU policy <Col N="317"/>that in order to draw down EU funding group schemes must join bundles or the person who makes this a requirement of funding; his views on whether without the leadership of a small group of persons these 1,500 families would still be without a water scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume that the Question refers to the Donaghmoyne group water scheme, County Monaghan. The provision of water treatment facilities through grouped or bundled DBO contracts was originally pilot-tested in Monaghan on the basis of a recommendation by the national rural water monitoring committee. The pilot project initially involved 11 group water schemes, including Donaghmoyne, and three local authority public water supply schemes. My Department provided a 100% capital grant to finance the project. The Donaghmoyne group scheme subsequently withdrew from the contract, notwithstanding the special 100% grant made available to schemes participating in the pilot project.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am satisfied that the pilot project clearly demonstrated that the bundled DBO approach provides good value for money in terms of both capital and operation and maintenance costs over the 20-year service phase of such contracts. This approach has now been mainstreamed with approximately 246 group schemes serving approximately 44,000 rural households participating in bundled DBO contracts around the country. The logistical challenge of upgrading water treatment facilities for these group schemes within the short timeframe for ensuring compliance with the drinking water regulations can best be met through grouped or bundled contracts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">DBO procurement is also the preferred procurement route for new public water and sewage treatment facilities, together with bundling of schemes where it has the potential to produce economies. There are many such bundled schemes nationally. In the case of the water supply scheme for Carrickmacross, the planning of the scheme was not sufficiently advanced for it to be included in the Monaghan pilot project. However, the preliminary report for the scheme subsequently approved by my Department envisages the use of DBO procurement; and leaves open the possibility of bundling this scheme with others.</P>
        <P>EU co-financing is provided for a number of measures under the rural water programme, including the provision of water treatment facilities for privately sourced group water schemes. EU co-financing is available for projects procured by both conventional and DBO contracts. The eligibility criteria include compliance with public procurement, financial management and control procedures, including prior approval of technical <Col N="318"/>specification and approval of grants in advance of commencement of works.</P>

        <Quest>if he intends to roll back the powers of city and county managers and expand the role of local elected representatives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Local Government Act 2001 responsibility for the performance of local authority functions is shared between the elected council and the manager, with the council having the pre-eminent role through its determination of the policy and budgetary framework, and its powers of oversight and direction of the activities of the local authority.</P>
        <P>The local government modernisation programme provides an enhanced role for elected members in policy formulation and review, in partnership with representatives of the social partners and sectoral interests through the establishment of strategic policy committees. The role of the elected member is further strengthened through the operation of the corporate policy group, which comprises the cathaoirleach and the chairs of the strategic policy committees. Additionally, local authorities have a lead role and wider sphere of influence in the county and city development board, CDB, system. The CDBs allow elected members a direct input into the services provided by other public bodies at local level.</P>
        <P>The role of the locally elected representative has also been enhanced by the creation of the single mandate, the improved financial support framework for members and better training and information opportunities. I am determined to intensify and consolidate the gains made through the modernisation programme and, in particular, to promote improvements in performance and in service delivery by local authorities to their communities. Elected members will continue to have a key role in ensuring that their local authorities deliver on this change agenda.</P>

        <Quest>
         in view of the survey under way into the development of a Liffey Valley park, his views on whether the lands at Cooldrinagh, Leixlip which are within the Liffey Valley catchment and were recently purchased by Fingal County Council with national funds for the expansion of their water treatment plant are potentially in conflict with the objective of developing such a park; and <Col N="319"/>if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

	<P>Fingal County Council&rsquo;s proposal to expand the Leixlip water treatment plant is included in my Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2004-06. Lands at Cooldrinagh have been acquired by the council for this purpose. I understand that Fingal County Council has an application for planning permission for the treatment plant with South Dublin County Council, in whose functional <Col N="320"/>ambit it would be located. Further advancement of this proposal will be contingent on the outcome of the planning process.</P>
        <P>I understand that the Liffey Valley park feasibility study is being undertaken by the Office of Public Works on behalf of Dublin City Council and Fingal, Kildare and South Dublin County Councils to assist the establishment of a Liffey Valley park. Apart from lands already acquired by the State for this project, and which do not include the above Cooldrinagh site, the precise extent of the proposed Liffey Valley park remains to be determined in light of the study now under way.</P>
